2	Jslay427	2014-05-18	7. Decent build up for what should be an epic episode.
3	makchamp	2014-05-18	Really enjoyed this episode. Didn't expect that ending at all.Â 
Â 
9
4	Tywin Manderly	2014-05-18	9.
5	ultimo12	2014-05-18	8,5/10
Â 
it lacked fighting, apart from that i liked it!
6	franko99	2014-05-18	First episode I didn't enjoy an Arya/Hound scene, the dialogue during the gift of mercy was cringeworthy, and the random way Rorge and Bitter show up and die in 10 seconds was lame. Also the season is almost over and Sandor hasn't even mentioned Sansa, not even once, wtf?
Â 
The Eyrie scenes were great, Sophie was amazing as always, but who is going to be framed for Lysa's death? That little detail left me with a bad taste for what it could have been a great ending.Â 
Â 
Brienne and Pod, whatever...there was Hotpie!!! Best part of the episode 
Â 
Tyrion/Jaime and Tyrion/Bronn were ok, but I think Bronn should have explained what the hell happen with ShaeÂ  
Â 
Oberyn was ok, but once he started telling the story I was hoping they mention the reason why the Martell went to Casterly Rock, but they're probably saving that for next episode.
Â 
Edit: change my vote to 7Â

13	Ran	2014-05-18	First 9 of the season for me. The weakest stuff was either very brief (the Gregor scene, which was just too cliche to take seriously) or not all that weak at all (mostly it was just kind of weird, like the Rorge scene where he just sort of stands there and has a chat and then dies; I'm thinking Sakharov is homaging something, maybe something from Kurosawa I keep thinking), and the strong stuff was really, really strong (Pedro Pascal hits it out of the park in this one!)
14	tito5601	2014-05-18	a 9 for me that was a great episode with lots of buildup i rlly enjoyed this ep the oberyn and tyrion scene was perfect makes us really want oberyn to get his revenge not only to save tyrions life but also for dorne
15	darksellsword	2014-05-18	Gave it an 8 would of given a 9 if it hadn't been for that ridiculous Daario scene and I didn't like the hound confiding in Arya like that. It all felt a little rushed aswell. I thought Aidan Gillen was very good in this episode can't understand for the life of me why they changed "only cat" to "your sister"
16	Nuts and Boltons	2014-05-18	Pedro and Aidan killed it
Â
17	Fez	2014-05-18	9/10
Â 
Which may be the highest I've given so far to an episode that's pretty much entirely set-up. However, there were just too many incredibly strong scenes to go lower, with Oberyn/Tyrion being the highlight.
18	shk12344	2014-05-18	First 45 minutes 3/10, last 15 minutes 10/10
19	YourMomsBox	2014-05-18	It was an episode that obviously didn't have too much action which is totally fine. There wasn't a scene that I really rolled my eyes at or thought sucked. The Tyrion/Oberyn and LF/Sansa/Lysa scenes were picture perfect IMO. I can see that there is backlash because the exact quote before Lysa is thrown out the moon door isn't word for word. Doesn't bother me all that much. "Only Cat" vs "Your sister"? Is it that big of an issue?
20	Darth Pipes	2014-05-18	I'm going 10.Â  I've been down on D and D's writing this season but they really came through in a big way here.Â  They were bolstered by several of the performers, including Dinklage, Flynn, Pascal, Aiden, Turner, and Dickie.
21	of man and wolf	2014-05-18	I thought it was really good. The dialogue, how they put lines from other scenes in the books into these scenes. Good backstory for viewers to better understand things, without slowing anything down. Top notch acting, nothing at all bothered me. The Selyse and Mel scene was whatever, but I'm not as intrigued yet by their story arc.
22	tallTale	2014-05-18	Gave it a 6.
Â 
The way the Hound got injured was very weak. Not a fan of Dany's scenes either.
Â 
Thought they could have done a better job with Lysa's death.
Â 
Highlights were any of the Tyrion scenes.

23	Jntam93	2014-05-18	First 3/4 were boring me to death. The last bit starting with Oberyn speaking to Tyrion to the Eyrie were amazing.
Â 
8/10
24	Javi Marcos	2014-05-18	Rorge and Biter scene was absurd, Pod and Brienne interactions didn't feel right. I missed Marillion and Only Cat line. And Mel and Selyse wasn't really strong.
Â 
A 7.
25	Howdyphillip	2014-05-18	9 - This was a fantastic episode. Peter Dinkledge was tremendous throughout, and Rory McCann was fantastic.
Â 
Another nod to the lighting crew. The Dungeon scenes are some of the most complex work that can be shot, and they are hitting it perfectly
26	Died a Hero	2014-05-18	8
Â 
liked everything but gravy talk and the bitter change. For the life of me, I will never understand why D&D do things like this. We know Brienne is going to get jumped sometime this season and bite a man's ear off (she said so in one the 1,000 mini trailers before this season started) but it wont be the bitter for some reason? Why not make the random guy the one who attack The Hound and not the one that has an actual plot thread?
27	NOT A TARG I SWEAR	2014-05-18	It was an episode that obviously didn't have too much action which is totally fine. There wasn't a scene that I really rolled my eyes at or thought sucked.

that one arya line was kind of eyeroll worthy about "nothingness". other than that pretty great.
28	Ice_Specter	2014-05-18	I loved that scene between Oberyn and Tyrion.
The push was awesome
I wish the mountain had more of a beard or something to make him more gruff

29	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-05-18	Some minor flaws, but this episode could possibly be my favorite of this season so far. I'm going to go with a solid 9.5
30	Frey Pies	2014-05-18	I think D&D's dialogue has been really, really good this season. Rivalling GRRM and BC easily.Â 
Â 
Easy 10 for me. One of the best GoT episodes ever, imo.
31	ToTheWolves	2014-05-18	Where is my "only cat" line!!? Does this mean I'm not going to get "the wall is yours jon snow" or "stannis! Stannis! Stannis!"
32	TheHouseHB	2014-05-18	I gave it a 10 best episode of the season. Loved seeing Hot Pie again, loved everything Oberyn/Tyrion/Jaime/Bronn and Stokeworth yes. Also, everything Littlefinger and Sansa was how I thought it would be and Snow Castle/Moon Door.
33	Knight of Ashes	2014-05-18	8. Pretty much every scene had something interesting in it and nothing that made me wince.
Tyrion's scenes with Jaime, Bronn, and whatsisname, Viper dude were all well done.
Seeing Hot Pie again was more welcome than I expected (and I'm glad Biter won't get to eat Brienne's face, at least in the show) Maybe it was too convenient but I don't care.
I was a little taken aback at how long the kiss 'tween Sansa and Baelish lasted. I daresay she was kissing back.

34	OnlyOne	2014-05-18	For all the OP's who thought LF looked at Sansa as a daughter, I tried to tell you. Oh how I tried to tell you. So glad Lysa went out the moon door;-)
I thought the Tyrion/Oberyn scene was terrific. 
Well, the Hound has his wound and Arya will be on her way soon. 
Hot pie - eh. Nice but eh.

35	jarl the climber	2014-05-18	An 8, it was a good set up episode. I sort of liked the Dragonstone scene, most people seemed meh with it but I thought there was some good stuff in there, leaving Shireen at Dragonstone really does not make sense. Still the non-verbal communication was good. Arya and the Hound was a little silly but they established a few things that were important. The return of Hot Pie speaks for itself. Everything else was quite good except for the hammy scene with Ser Gregor but I guess they had too much fake blood laying around and it was nearing the expiration date.Â
36	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-05-18	I gave this episode a 10, the second time this season. I really enjoyed this episode, I don't think there is a scene I can complain about.
Â 
Emilia Clarke was absolutely radiant. I loved the scene with her and Michiel.
Â 
Rory McCann is the Hound, as ever. I love him so much in the show, and I will be sad to see him go. I hope we see him again.
Â 
The acting was so good in this episode. I'm glad they stayed faithful to the books by including the snow castle Sansa builds, and the story Oberyn tells about Cersei. It's those little things that really enhance the character building for me. I enjoyed seeing it translatedÂ  onto screen.
Â 
As others said, nicely setting up the story for later. Standout episode for me.
37	go joff go	2014-05-18	First 9 of the season for me. The weakest stuff was either very brief (the Gregor scene, which was just too cliche to take seriously) or not all that weak at all (mostly it was just kind of weird, like the Rorge scene where he just sort of stands there and has a chat and then dies; I'm thinking Sakharov is homaging something, maybe something from Kurosawa I keep thinking), and the strong stuff was really, really strong (Pedro Pascal hits it out of the park in this one!)
This Gregor might be a worse actor  then the last two.  His one line made me cringe as the delivery was totally wrong. But eh whatever
38	YourMomsBox	2014-05-18	ToTheWolves, don't be surprised if D&D turn "Stannis! Stannis! Stannis!" into them chanting "The night is dark and full of terror!".
D&D hate Stannis that much...
39	Ran	2014-05-18	This Gregor might be a worse actor then the last two. His one line made me cringe as the delivery was totally wrong. But eh whatever


Â 
I think he's been dubbed. BjA¶rnsson has a very heavy Icelandic accent in real life. It may be the same person who dubbed Ian White in S2.
Â 
So, the delivery isn't necessarily his fault, per se.
Â 
And just to say it again, Pedro Pascal was stunningly good. I got goose bumps when he asked, "But what about what I want?"
40	OnlyOne	2014-05-18	Team Dragonstone scene sucked, but apart from that, I liked it.Â 
Â 
8/10.

Agreed. Makes me worry for Shireen though.
41	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-18	Every single scene was so good. I'll be more descriptive after a rewatch.
Â 
I'd say 9/10
Â 
best episode of the season so far
42	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-05-18	Awesome episode. The worse thing about this episode was learning next week's episode wasn't coming until 2 weeks! 9/10--best season ever!!

43	dmo862000	2014-05-18	One complaint: Biter scene was kind of ridiculous. Aside from that? Amazing, especially for a setup episode. Season 4, for me, has (dare I say it?) equaled and possibly surpassed GRRM as far as quality overall is concerned. Okay so for this episode: I don't recall Sweet Robin getting slapped in the books, its been awhile and I could have just completely forgotten, but either way, great. Oberyn/Tyrion.... great scene.... love the Casterly Rock recall. Initial Jaime and Tyrion scene was great as well. Bronn made me uncomfortable in his new clothes and demeanor but by the time it was all said and done its possibly the most heart touching moment you could get between a mercenary with no morals and a narcissistic, overentitled dwarf without seeming forced. Hot Pie? 'nuff said. I thought Brienne talking about Sansa by name was stupid and loved that Pod called her out on it even if she was right. Jorah changing Daenery's mind was also rather swell IMO. No complaints here. The complaint of Petyr calling her 'sister' instead of 'Cat' makes sense as its a show and it makes it easier to understand for show watchers. It's, IMO, more of a 'decomplicating of things' more than anything else for viewers.Â
44	Sir Dominus	2014-05-18	Would've been a 9 if they didn't rush the moondoor scene and change the "only Cat" line.
45	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-05-18	Another episode filled with amazing acting and dialogue. I really loved it.

46	boojam	2014-05-18	I did not expect 'by the book' , rearanged as it is , that is, the KL stuff was 'by the book', and the Eyrie condensed but 'by the book'.Arya's story... oddly modified, but was fine with me , seems the Arya scene should been constructed a little differently , the killing seemed awkard, ok, but too sudden.Ben Hawkey! Saw no warning about his appearance.Briennes's story, fine by me, but where is it going?To bad not more time at Castle Black. They didn't have it.Marking time at Meereen, Clarke was very good this episode.A D&D episode, well done, see... they can do it.Alas! A two week break!
47	teej6	2014-05-18	Pedro Pascal is perfect. I luv his accent.Â
48	HazelPhoenixFire	2014-05-18	I'm going 10.Â  I've been down on D and D's writing this season but they really came through in a big way here.Â  They were bolstered by several of the performers, including Dinklage, Flynn, Pascal, Aiden, Turner, and Dickie.

Thank you, I thought I was the only one who felt the writing was suffering this season! Some of the episodes have been great, but not their strongest collective work by far.
49	Lady Sansa's Direwolf	2014-05-18	Loved the 3 jail visits. Jamie least of the three, Oberyn the best. Bronn seemed as uncomfortable with the discussion as he did in his new clothes. He knows he's selling out but what can he do? But Oberlyn... if there was a nearly flawless delivery this episode, it was "What about what I want?" The depth of his pain really shone through, something that hasn't happened a lot with all his banter.
Â 
Meh on the Mountain. He's the right body for the job, talking is optional IMO.
Â 
The Eryie was too short and felt rushed. While I enjoyed the stop at the inn and the surprise meeting with Hot Pie, I would have preferred less gravy (though I laughed at the moment) and more Crazy Lysa. And the Sansa/Petyr scenes gave an appropriate creepy conspiratorial tone. Little Robin deserved the slap but I though Sansa's anger was a little much but it might have been the delivery.
Â 
Overall, a solid 8.5 out of 10. One of the best setup episodes of the series. If only it had been ten minutes longer...Â
50	Queen Elsa	2014-05-18	Awesome episode and I don't want it to end (but it still did). Can't wait for the next one.
Â 
I give it a 8/10.Â
51	A Man Reads	2014-05-18	9/10. We're building up to the end now.
Â 
Likes:
Tyrion and Bronn. What a fabulous sequence!
	The Hound's confession. You confess before you . . .
	Sansa and Robert Arryn.Â 
	Using Hot Pie. Wasn't big on how they used him, but still. Saves considerable time.
	They left Dragonstone off the credits. And Melisandre said Shireen must come with them. We're going to be left hanging until they arrive.
	The small details are what makes the show wonderful.
	Transitioning from Daario's rearguard to Melisandre's Van (Houten) guard was a nice touch. Also, the Hound "getting . . . bitten!"
	I like that Dany is in for a descent.
	EDIT: And I loved how they mixed in Tyrion's three jail visitors.
Dislikes:
The first Hound/Arya ("two swords") scene could have been skipped. The gift of mercy part was nice, killing Rorge was nice -- but we've had both of these already. I wondered if the two Hound/Arya scenes were originally set for different episodes.
	Ghost at the wall. I get that the wolves are CGI and inserted, but he's off standing on his own and it looks terrible.

52	Peachie	2014-05-18	Would have loved to have "Only Cat" but thought the change made sense for the Unsullied. Really happy with the non-book scenes in this one as well as the changes to the LF/Lysa/SR/Sansa scene.
Â 
And really, any episode with the return of Hot Pie is an automatic 10.
53	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-18	I was considering an 8. Then, Hot Pie. A 9.
54	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-05-18	The Oberyn Tyrion scene made the episode in my opinion, great scene.

There was so much to be positive about in this episode; things from the books I had no idea would make it to the show and to say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.
	Spoiler â<U+0080><U+008B>I almost wish they would change things next episode to keep Pedro around longer. That guy is on his way to amazing things.

Why they felt the need to change one of the series most iconic lines is beyond me. I know there's a lot of names to remember but if unsullied can't remember who Catelyn Stark is by name then they should probably not be watching.Â 
Aside from that, awesome episode. Ranks at the 3rd best of the season so far for me, behind last weeks and episode 2. 
	Spoiler It's gonna be absolute mayhem from here until the end.Â
60	Scrambled Aegon	2014-05-18	Generally a really good episode, but I'm upset enough about how much they inexplicably watered down the Eyrie scene that for now I'm giving it a 3. Maybe I'll get over it in the next week, but I doubt it.

65	Ser Lady Nym	2014-05-18	I usually don't drink and vote, but I'm giving this a 10. Â I enjoyed the hell outta this episode! Â Based almost solely on Oberyn telling Tyrion about his visit to CR.Â  Â Fuuuuuuuu I am gonna miss him.
Â 
I feel like everyone watching just shared a moment as we all yelled "Hot Pie!!!" Â Also, Bronn and Lollys, nice.
Â 
Seriously disappointed in the Dany/Daario scene. Â So what happened... did they tickle each other all night? The mood, it was not set. Â I can't believe I'm complaining about lack of sex...
Â 
I don't care about "only Cat". Â While a bit rushed, it worked. Â I knew the snow castle would never compare to the books, so, I liked it.Â
66	Ser Dank the Jedi	2014-05-18	Gave it an 8. Â Loved seeing Bronn living la vida loca.
67	Hoo	2014-05-18	Great episode, I gave it a 9. Â The dialogue was great, and relationship development was awesome as well.
68	The Monkey	2014-05-18	Voted 9. The Tyrion/Oberyn scene was one of the strongest in the show's history. The editing where Arya killed Rorge was a bit off, but I'm never one to complain about getting more badass-Arya scenes. The Dany scenes were fine, as were the ones from The Wall.
Â 
The only mediocre scene was the one with Melisandre. Put some clothes on, ffs, you're talking to your queen.
Â 
Also, Hot Pie! I had no idea he was returning this season. Was the casting a secret, or did I just miss it?

"Winterhell"
70	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-18	"Winterhell" LOL, I'm sending that to the "best quotes" thread. I actually laughed aloud
71	Mack Kilimaro	2014-05-18	10/10, not exactly perfect, but if all those scenes that are more or less right word for word from ASOS, and happened to be hit out of the park in the show, don't sway you, then I don't think anything ever will. Bronn's visit to Tyrion, Oberyn's visit to Tyrion, Sansa's snow castle... and then, just for fun, Hot Pie.
72	sj4iy	2014-05-18	The only mediocre scene was the one with Melisandre. Put some clothes on, ffs, you're talking to your queen.

Pretty sure it's the other way 'round at this point.
73	Nictarion	2014-05-18	LOL, I'm sending that to the "best quotes" thread. I actually laughed aloud 


Same here, he 's actually said that before in a previous episode, but it didn't make it any less funny.
74	Corvinus	2014-05-18	Gave it an 8. Would have been a 9, but for the replacing of "Only Cat" with "Your sister" because once again D&D felt they needed to appease the Unsullied, and also because for some reason, the intro didn't have the Eyire, but it did have Braavos.
75	johnnysd	2014-05-18	Generally a really good episode, but I'm upset enough about how much they inexplicably watered down the Eyrie scene that for now I'm giving it a 3. Maybe I'll get over it in the next week, but I doubt it.


Â 
What in the hell was watered down about it? I've only read the books 3 times and it seemed almost exactly like the books minus Marillion.
76	sastelise	2014-05-18	10. It was more subdued than other episodes, but I like how they handled every scene. And hot pie is back!!! YOU CAN'T GIVE UP ON THE GRAVY!
77	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-05-18	The only thing I really disliked (and I'm only posting it here because there's no "negative" nitpicking thread) was that just after Lysa was pushed, that was a really low-budget looking effect. Also the episode is called Mockingbird and it took 40 minutes to get to anything Petyr-related.Â 
Â 
I don't really buy into these threads' numerical rating system, but I will say that while episode 6 is still my favorite of the season, this one was overall pretty good.Â

Â 
Unlike in some of the other episodes, ALL of the convos were great and interesting. Good conversations make up for a lack of action.
79	Brother Walfrid	2014-05-18	7
Really liked the episode, fist-pumped when Hotpie arrived, jumped out my seat when Biter bit the hound, loved Sansa slapping Robert and her sly grins when Robert and little finger hinted at vengeance.
HATED the mountain,,,why cast someone so young and pretty looking who has to be dubbed?
Annoyed at lack of Only Cat, but realize it doesn't make a shred of difference to the plot. I just don't understand why they felt any need to change such an iconic line.
80	Mark Antony	2014-05-18	And just to say it again, Pedro Pascal was stunningly good. I got goose bumps when he asked, "But what about what I want?"
Yup his scene was my favorite of the episode. Pedro was brilliant as was the actress for Lysa (forgot her name).
Solid 9. Only 2 or 3 scenes I was meh on
81	rmholt	2014-05-18	Â 
Seriously disappointed in the Dany/Daario scene. Â So what happened....Â

82	Nictarion	2014-05-18	The only thing I really disliked (and I'm only posting it here because there's no "negative" nitpicking thread) was that just after Lysa was pushed, that was a really low-budget looking effect.


I thought so too.
83	rmholt	2014-05-18	"Winterhell" 

Nice
84	chicagostatecougars	2014-05-18	4. I didn't enjoy the fan fiction too much although there were some pretty good scenes, especially the last one. Lysa Arryn's actress is outstanding.
85	Ser Blake	2014-05-18	All 3 of Tyrion's scenes were freaking phenomenal this episode.Â
86	Facelesss Fan	2014-05-18	8- Solid movement in the plot.
Never liked Daario in the books too cocky, but this cat is too laid back.
Arya/Hound- On point enough for me.
Hot Pie/Brienne/Podrick -Best scene to me. Gotta love the improvement in HP baking.
87	chicagostatecougars	2014-05-18	Oh man I really don't like how the Mountain looks now. Â I guess it's hard to find actors with suitable dimension though. Season 1 Gregor was the best.
88	edgeroc	2014-05-18	a 9 for me, and it's not even a debate.
Â 
This reminded me of one of my favorite episodes from season 3, second sons. GoT has always been for me all about the dialog and character interactions. I am never mad when they skip a battle scene, like in season 2. Battles in this show don't do it for me, It's the way the characters interact with each other with the fantastic score in the background that do it. In my opinion, this was my favorite episode of the season so far.
Â 
The Tyrion and Bronn scene- I have been waiting for this scene and it was remarkable.
Â 
Finally, a Brianne and Pod scene I actually liked, and Hotpie!
Â 
The Vale scenes, what a way to end a show.
Â 
Tyrion scenes, as always he kills it.
Â 
The only reason it is not a 10 is because of one reason. The Mountain scene was so lame to me, anyone who has watched this show knows what the mountain is all about and surprise, it's a totally different actor..again. It just seemed so out of place.Â 
Â 
Loved every other scene is this episode, I even enjoyed the Dragonstone scene. The actress that plays the red woman is just so captivating, one of the reasons second sons is one of my all time favorites.
Â 
I'm going to have to take a mini hiatus on this forum because I don't want to know what happens in the next episode and people always like to blurt out random things to show that they are book readers. I love Tyrion and I like Prince Oberyn, so there is now way I'm going to take a chance on this being spoiled. All I know is the last few episodes this season are going to be epic.
Â 
There are only four episodes in this series so far that I have given a 10. Rains, Baleor, Golden Crown. and Blackwater. This episode was a strong 9 for me and ranks up there with second sons and Prince of Winterfell for my favorites of the non 10s.
89	Goldfinger	2014-05-18	Hmmm
90	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-05-18	Oh man I really don't like how the Mountain looks now. Â I guess it's hard to find actors with suitable dimension though. Season 1 Gregor was the best.


Â 
You never really saw him out of his armor, honestly I didn't realize that Season 2 Gregor was a different actor than Season 1 at the time. But whatever, they're all big, bearded muscle men. I still can't get over the recasting of Daario Naharis. I understand that Skrein took another role (did they not make him sign a contract?), but all of a sudden Daario had a beard, different colored hair, and no sexy accent.Â

Season 2 Gregor looks like he''s an 8 foot tall crack fiend. They got the height right but he was a skinny motherfucker.
93	Seneti	2014-05-18	8/10.
Â 
There were a few bits I didn't like (the beginning of the first scene between Arya and the Hound + Brienne mentioning Sansa by name spring to mind), but overall it was really good!
94	chicagostatecougars	2014-05-18	I actually felt this episode stayed closest to the book of any this season. With a few exceptions ofc.


I can't agree. The Winterfell castle scene was one of my very favorite chapters ever from any book, but they portrayed Sansa terribly. And the Brienne scenes were created by the show writers. I don't like anything not authentic to GRRM.
95	Lothar	2014-05-18	Â 
What in the hell was watered down about it? I've only read the books 3 times and it seemed almost exactly like the books minus Marillion.


Â 
It was clearly very rushed. Â It was a heartfelt emotional moment in the books that let you feel for her as she was building Winterfell. Â That she was going over every detail, spending all morning making it, thinking of all the memories. Â Then getting frustrated because she couldn't get just right, which is when Petyr showed up to help her. Â In the show, she walks out into the snow, and then we cut to where the castle's already made. Â What kind of unemotional robot would decide to make that cut? Â Can we go 10 seconds in this show without dialogue? Â  They stripped the heart from that scene. Â 
Â 
Now I do appreciate that it was in there at all even for a handful of rushed seconds but it wasn't even a fraction of what I wanted. Â

96	Victor The Bookreader	2014-05-18	"your sister" doesn't have the same ring as "only cat" but still an awesome ep 10/10
Tyrion/Bronn/Red Viper was better then books imo, the feels
97	chicagostatecougars	2014-05-18	Another thing...Rorge and Biter reduced to a couple of non threatening fools. Again though, I am a book reader foremost. Â I like authenticity.
98	Jay92	2014-05-18	That was just a really solid episode. I'll give it a 9. They played it pretty close to the books too with the Bronn/Tyrion conversation being word for word and even brought up Oberyn conversation that happened earlier in the books and it managed to work well. Sansa and Littlefinger... I guess they certainly won't back off the creepiness of that relationship. Brienne running into Hot Pie was pretty cool and learning about Arya and now she is on her way to the Eyrie. I liked the second Hound/Arya scene, liked that Hound opened up a bit.
Â 
I was hoping to hear "Only Cat" but its not a big deal. Overall, the scene was cooler in the books with the whole reveal that Littlefinger was behind everything but it was still great nonetheless.
Â 
Can't wait for the Red Viper vs The Mountain next week!Â

I wouldn't say non threatening considering Biter gave SandorÂ his wound, but yeah that change was a bit odd. Other that that I didn't think anything was drastically different, a few added scenes, but not changed ones.
100	Nictarion	2014-05-18	Â 
Can't wait for the Red Viper vs The Mountain next week!Â 


 Â You have to wait 2 weeks.
101	Goldfinger	2014-05-18	The Moon Door and Flying Lysa !!! Definitely one of the highlights of the season....
102	Jay92	2014-05-18	Â You have to wait 2 weeks.


Â 
Oh yeah forgot. I'm sad now.Â
103	Ambitious Lannister	2014-05-18	I enjoyed the episode. Loved watching Lysa get thrown out the moon door (though I would have liked the "only cat" too as other people have said already). Really liked the Gwen and Pod dynamic.
104	Nakraal	2014-05-18	Can one amazing scene raise an episode from an 8 to a 10?
Â 
If so,the Oberyn scene does that. Maybe top 5 scenes from all seasons for me.
					
					
							Edited by Nakraal, 18 May 2014 - 11:59 PM.
105	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-05-19	I thought so too.


Â 
Yeah, she looks like she's still close to the door but also tiny. Not only is it less than what I've come to expect in terms of effects, but I went back and watched Tyrion's Vale trial from the FIRST season, and when Bronn made Vardis fly it definitely looked a lot better, which makes it even more puzzling.Â
106	Ice Wolf	2014-05-19	Liked:
Tyrion's three visitors.
Brienne and Pod.
The Hound discussing his backstory.
The Eyrie scenes (a pass mark, didn't nail it completely but wasn't butchered).
Hot Pie!
Naked Melisandre 
Â 
Disliked:
No 'Only Cat' (I realise it's not a big deal but I was expecting the line and the change almost took me out of the moment).
Dany's scenes continue to fall flat.
107	Ruin	2014-05-19	The Mountain re-re-introduction was...well...I thought it'd be better.Â  Seeing Hotpie and Pod in a scene together was EPIC!
108	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-05-19	I can't believe they didn't have him do "Only Cat"
109	lostinwesteros	2014-05-19	A 9. Â The Tyrion/Jaime and Tyrion/Oberyn scenes were knocked out of the ball park, as were the ones at The Vale. Â Damn! That Moon Door is one scary piece of interior decorating, Â Actor who plays LF is SO good at being a perv.
110	kephv	2014-05-19	7. Almost the entire Hound and Arya speech with the old man was terrible. And the way Biter just appeared out of nowhere to bite the Hound, strange out of a cheesy zombie movie, or tv show (Walking Dead). Jorah's speech about good and evil was equally cringe worthy, though I liked Dany's scenes overall. Kingslanding was good as usually. Glad they kept Bronn's speech with Tyrion and his line about killing Gregor himself.
Â 
Also, have they even called Oberyn the Viper yet? Strange since the name is in the title of the next episode.
Â 
Â 


I can't believe they didn't have him do "Only Cat"


Â 
Â 
Just doesn't leave the lasting effect that only Cat did.
111	averde	2014-05-19	It was an episode that obviously didn't have too much action which is totally fine. There wasn't a scene that I really rolled my eyes at or thought sucked. The Tyrion/Oberyn and LF/Sansa/Lysa scenes were picture perfect IMO. I can see that there is backlash because the exact quote before Lysa is thrown out the moon door isn't word for word. Doesn't bother me all that much. "Only Cat" vs "Your sister"? Is it that big of an issue?

I agree with this assessment pretty much, one of my favorite episodes of the season so far . There wasn't any scene that I hated and ruined the episode for me. The Tyrion/Oberyn and Littlefinger/ Sansa/ Lysa scenes were great and well acted. 
I assumed they changed the "Only Cat" quote because their worried show viewers might not realize who Cat is when he says it so the viewers won't feel that oh shit that poor ugly sister moment before he killed Lysa.

Â 
Wow, the scene would play exactly the same if she had 10 seconds of frustration in not getting a tower right. Exactly the same. And every bit of the heart of the scene is there. Not sure what you could possibly want, they cannot visualize every internal thought she has during that chapter, but the very essence of the scene is there. I actually thought it was one of the Top 5 scenes in the entire show that felt like the books and jumping right from the page. I thought it was shockingly faithful in plot and tone.
113	The Wandering Knight	2014-05-19	My ONLY criticism of this episode was that I wanted more time with Sansa and Snow Winterfell. I thought that went by a little to quickly. Apart from that, great episode. I've always been a Stark bannerman, but I'm feeling good that Sansa's storyline is getting some steam. Yeah.... team Sansa!

Â 
Yeah the reasoning is probably correct, but I think in that respect the show made a mistake - even my mom knows Cat (and she rarely remembers anyones name).. just the other day she texted me asking "isn't that Cat from Game of Thrones??" while watching the new 24..
115	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-19	Great
-Dany/Jorah: perfect, perfect, perfect
-Dragonstone: Nice to humanize Melisandre and Carice looks really good naked
-Brienne and Podrick and, the nice surprise, HOT PIE!
-Arya's second scene: great character moment for the Hound
-Tyrion/Bronn: Surprised that a D&D-written scene was adapted from the novel nearly word-for-word
-Tyrion/Oberyn: Simply amazing
-All of Sansa's scenes
Â 
Okay
-Tyrion/Jaime: was necessary, but didn't wow
-Cersei/Mountain: cheesy, but effective, I suppose
-Jon vs. Alliser
-Dany/Daario
-Arya first scene
Â 
Bad
-Just nitpicks: Lysa falling out looked silly, Rorge standing around was stupid
Â 
9/10
Â 
Best episode of the season thus far

Â 
Yeah, the scene would have been the same if they added 10 seconds of frustration. Â Because that would mean they only devoted 15 seconds to the scene before the dialogue came in, so it would still be extremely rushed. Â Now if they actually spent some time showing her building the castle, then it wouldn't be the same. Â How on earth can you say you're not sure what I could possibly want when I just told you? Â I wanted more than 10 seconds of her in the snow without dialogue. Â I wanted the audience to spend time with her as she's building the castle thinking about the emotions that she must be experiencing as she's building it. Â Give them some time to feel (not just understand, but feel) how badly she is missing Winterfell. Â The show didn't even give people a chance to process it before Robin came in and started talking. Â Non-book readers don't know that she spent all morning building it or how much it meant for it to be as perfect to her memories as possible.
Â 
The building of the castle was a powerful heartfelt scene in the books. Â No dialogue at all is needed. Â People could figure out what was going through her head.

117	Alboin	2014-05-19	Oberyn and the Eyrie are so brilliant, I am speechless. At the same time - Mountain? Shockingly weak. Gave it a 9 either way, just because I'm grateful for those amazing scenes.
118	Widows_Blood	2014-05-19	Oberyns speech gave me goosebumps. Aiden was fantastic; he really shined in this one.Â
119	Dragonglass Order	2014-05-19	8. Â I didn't think the Eyrie scene was that great. Â The kiss seemed almost consensual - she didn't even push him away for a whole ten seconds! Â The effect of Lysa going out the moon door was surprisingly bad. Â I missed hearing "only Cat," but that might just be because I've been reading this forum with people going on about it so much. Â Overall, the scene just wasn't very epic. Â I wanted it to be my favourite scene of the episode, but that honour has to go to Tyrion/Oberyn, which was fantastic.

120	Frey Pies	2014-05-19	The last 15 minutes of this episode, in my opinion, have only been rivalled by the last 15 of The Rains of Castamere and And Now His Watch Is Ended. Powerful, powerful stuff.Â
121	Mr Smith	2014-05-19	7 I think. Some really clunkly dialogue here and there.
Â 
Oberyn is a fucking legend.
Â 
The first Hound and Arya scene was really quite terrible, poor dialogue, and Rorge showing up out of nowhere and then dying ridiculously easily. They really should be able to do better than that.
Â 
I don't feel like they've done enough with the time they've had at the wall this season; its just been week after week of Ser Allister putting Jon down. Again guys, you should be doing better.
Â 
Mixed feelings about the final moments. Great to see that the snow castle was in there, and they did keep some good dialogue from the book, but not enough. Aiden Gillen continues to disappoint in the crucial moments.
122	Queen of Whores	2014-05-19	A very solid 7 out of 10. Definitely my favourite episode of this season, and the one I've rated the highest. I didn't like Arya, Daenerys or Brienne's scenes though. Arya's little monologue about nothing was really dumb and cringeworthy and trying to be deep and meaningful, but it fell flat to me and seemed like it was trying to hard. I'm also wondering how exactly Arya is going to do what she does soon with Sandor, seeing as how their relationship seems much more caring and mutual now. This doesn't work. Also, what exactly is going on with Yunkai, Jorah and Daario? So does this mean Jorah's fate will be different to that of the novel's? And with Brienne's scenes... I don't know, something seems off about her. She seems much more loud and snarky than normal. I prefer the quiet and shy Brienne of the books, but whatever. Although I mourn the loss of what seems to be nearly all of herÂ FeastÂ storyline (which I actually liked), it was pretty funny having Hot Pie have a little cameo, and for once D&D seem to be showing a little bit of continuity between seasons, which has been sorely lacking this season. Oh and Emilia is still a really bad actress, I'm sorry. I can't believe she has the same tone when ordering a guy to strip that she does while holding court. She has no range, sad to say. I also thought that scene should have been built up more, and it's weird that after all the needless and gratuitous sex in this show, they don't show this one? One that is arguably more relevent than most the show has done? And I'm not just saying that cause I wanted to see Emilia naked again...... okay well a bit of me is  The Melisandre scene made up for it though, even though other than Carice's beautiful body the scene was rather forgettable. I would have rather had a Stannis scene. Also, the Jon scene was ridiculously redundant and pointless, and really didn't need to be there. All it did was establish Yarwick (sp?) as a character, which while I'm glad for, this scene still really was unnecessary. We get it, Alliser Thorne is an asshole.
Â 
But that's enough of the negatives. Now to the positives, and this episode there were quite a few big ones for me. First of all, I'm ridiculously happy they kept the Tyrion and Bronn farewell scene very accurate. I was very surprised they bothered keeping in Lollys and Falyse and Bronn's marriage and new lordship. I loved that little subplot he got in the books, and I'm very glad they are keeping it in the show. Unlike Tyrion's other farewell scene with Pod, which I thought was very cheesy and sappy and dumb, I thought this one was done excellently. I alsoÂ lovedÂ the Oberyn and Tyrion scene. NowÂ thatÂ is how a long conversation is done, D&D. No cheese, no sentimentality, just straight up good dialogue and acting. Although I must give GRRM all the credit here, since I was very hopeful the show would include the Casterly Rock visit story, so I'm really happy they did. The bit where Oberyn tells Tyrion "I've come to the perfect place," was really awesome, and finally convinced me this guy is the only guy for Oberyn. And of course finally, the Eyrie scene was fantastic, and just as good as I hoped for. Everything was perfectly done, from the beautiful snow-covered Eyrie, to Sansa's Winterfell, to Sansa slapping Robin (a change I really liked), Littlefinger reminding us he's a creep, and then the great final scene with the Moondoor. All was done amazingly, and I have no complaints.Â 
Â 
Wow, I honestly think this is the first episode of season 4 I've come away from really satisfied. I want to rate this episode an 8, but the unremarkable first three quarters hold me back. The final fifteen minutes though were incredible, and the best parts of this season so far by a long shot. Hopefully this momentum is kept up for the final three episodes, which I'm sure it will be.Â 
Â 

	Spoiler I'm going to be very sad to see Oberyn go, though. This episode really convinced me of the actor's brilliance in the role, which I was hesitant towards previously.

129	Conchobar	2014-05-19	First episode I didn't enjoy an Arya/Hound scene, the dialogue during the gift of mercy was cringeworthy, and the random way Rorge and Bitter show up and die in 10 seconds was lame. Also the season is almost over and Sandor hasn't even mentioned Sansa, not even once, wtf?
Â 
The Eyrie scenes were great, Sophie was amazing as always, but who is going to be framed for Lysa's death? That little detail left me with a bad taste for what it could have been a great ending.Â 
Â 
Brienne and Pod, whatever...there was Hotpie!!! Best part of the episode 
Â 
Tyrion/Jaime and Tyrion/Bronn were ok, but I think Bronn should have explained what the hell happen with ShaeÂ  
Â 
Oberyn was ok, but once he started telling the story I was hoping they mention the reason why the Martell went to Casterly Rock, but they're probably saving that for next episode.
Â 
Edit: change my vote to 7Â 


I thought the dialogue was incredible, and not a bit cringe worthy, I loved their conversation about nothing.
Â 
I am curious to know what Ran thought of this episode, will have a look back and see if he said anything.

130	The hairy bear	2014-05-19	A very solid 8. Close to a nine, but the scenes with Gregor, Dany and Arya were rather weak. The Eyre scenes were 8 material, and everything with Tyrion was a ten.
Â 
The best episode of the season.
131	rmholt	2014-05-19	Another thing...Rorge and Biter reduced to a couple of non threatening fools. Again though, I am a book reader foremost. Â I like authenticity.

No shortage of dangerous villains if Brienne needs some.
They killed Tickler early but Arya found someone to take his place.
132	clawson24	2014-05-19	8/10. Really great but not flawless. Didn't love the Arya/Hound/Rorge/Biter stuff (super anti-climactic and a bit awkward) and the Eyrie stuff could've used a bit more time, but most of the big scenes were absolutely terrific. Tyrion/Jamie. Tyrion/Bronn. Tyrion/Oberyn! Lysa meeting the moon door. The Hound's story.
Â 
Expecting an utterly epic last 3 episodes.
133	rmholt	2014-05-19	How about what happens in the book: him talking shit about Mycah to get her to try to finish him?

That could happen if his ear starts to kill him
134	Corwin Jensen	2014-05-19	I gave it a 9, and that's only because I found that Dany-Daario sceene hilarious and because Petyr didn't say at the end: "Only Cat."

Was really hoping for more of a hellish freak-out from Lyssa,
and a some-what more primal scream of,Â AIYeeeee!!,
as flapped her sleeves.
Â 
But, hey, I go to sleep, feeling bad for a fictional baby whose littleÂ wink almost got pinched off.
The writers of this epic, GRMM, Show Guys, they're all sick little puppies.
Respect.
136	Alizard Erebys	2014-05-19	Solid 8 for me.Â 
Â 
Things I didn't like:
Â 
The scene with Arya, Sandor and the dying man felt really useless to me and honestly, when the man was talking I thought "Well, that's what happen when a mediocre actor lands in a terrific cast."
Â 
I really don't like Dario, no idea if it's the new actor or the character... maybe both.
Â 
Brienne saying "You say...?". Because yeah, they got damn lucky with Hotpie, but Pod is right about being discreet.
Â 
The Mountain slaughtering prisoners. I thought it was a gratuitous scene. I don't see how slaying worthless weaklings can "train" the Mountain in any way. He'd get more strength by hacking some trees...Â 
Â 
Things I liked:
Â 
The three jail scenes with Tyrion. In the Jaime one they really seem close, it's the first time I had the "brother" impression when I saw them, nailed it! The one with Bronn is great too, I like how Bronn explains to Tyrion that objectively he can't stand as his champion and there's nothing Tyrion can tell about it. Love the feeling of despair when Bronn leaves the cell.
The scene with Oberyn is the most intense of the three. I was really struck by the description of Cersei which really came to life.
Â 
The Hotpie scene was very nice. Also it's nice to see Brienne and Pod quickly on their way to awesome events.
Â 
The tragedy seems to keep building up at Castle Black.
Â 
The relationship between Sansa and Petyr is very interesting, loved the smile when he said he killed Jeoffrey to avenge Catelyn (it didn't feel like a lie to me but maybe I'm wrong). I think Baelish is one of the most powerful man in Westeros and the love he bears to Sansa gives her a certain power over him. I hope she'll realize that soon enough.
Â 
Overall very nice episode with awesome upcoming events.
137	ground_control	2014-05-19	9 of 10, but it really hurts 
Â 
Easily the best (imo, obviously) episode of the season, but I can only give it a '9' by pretending I never read the books -- as an adaptation, this episode is a 5 tops (the "Only Cat" rewrite is an automatic -5).
Â 
Like the last few episodes, the major flaw (imo) is grouping multiple scenes into one extended scene. Â In the books, we switch POVs frequently, and this pacing allows the overall story to be told in small bits, and I really like the slow build up that that pacing gives. Â In the last few episodes, the show seems to be grouping multiple short scenes into fewer, longer, scenes, and that makes a lot of those scenes feel rushed. Â For the last three episodes (4,5, and 6), this caused my to give severely low scores, as some of those scenes were written and filmed horribly, and having those scenes be such a large part of each episode magnified the horror.
Â 
In this episode, while I have major reservations about many things, these reservations were well-enough distributed that they didn't ruin any one particular scene, but to be honest, that's just blind luck.
Â 
Also, I've seen a lot of comments saying that this is a "set up " episode, and the people saying it are using it in a negative fashion, which disturbs me. Â ASOIAF is a long story, not a sequence of loosely related episodes. Â I don't want the show to make each (or any) one-hour (or less!) episode stand on its own, so I don't need x% actions scenes, y% boobies, and z% "zinger" lines. Â I don't want to see obvious "recap" moments. Â I'd be perfectly happy if the showrunners would say, "if you didn't get something, go watch the previous episodes".
Â 
But that's me.
138	TheEvilKing	2014-05-19	6/10, decent ep with nothing oustanding.
Â 
Best parts were the Tyrion scenes.
Â 
Mountain scene, eh. Why was he killing random peasants? Why weren't they just running away?
Â 
Brienne stuff was pretty good.
Â 
Bit of forced drama at The Wall, felt like they should have saved it for the next ep or left it out completely.
Â 
Dany scenes were better than expected.
Â 
Arya/Hound scenes were disappointingly weak this episode, and I usually enjoy them. That bloke took way too long to die, and the scene vs Rorge and Biter was dumb.
Â 
The Vale scenes I just find funny. I will say the outside bit was very pretty, though.
Â 
Dragonstone scene was only good for two reasons.
Â 
Generally, the ep was way too spread out. They've done a good job at cutting down the multiple stories per ep this season, but took their eye off the ball here.

139	north of the wall	2014-05-19	8. A little more moondoor action and crazy Lysa and it would have easily been a 9 or 10 for me. I also could have done without Mel and Selyse but oh well. Other than that very well acted (maybe not scripted though).
My biggest issue was probably the fact I was expecting too much of the end and it didn't quite have the tension I wanted. 
All in all very satisfying episode.

140	King Tyrion I	2014-05-19	10/10
Â 
They nailed it.
Â 
Oberyn/Tyrion
Bronn/Tyrion
Â 
It was really brilliant.
Â 
"Your sister" instead of "Only Cat" is okay for me.
141	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-19	A strong 9. Cannot give it 10, because it lacked that very extra special pace.Â 
Â 
The Vale sequence was good. I imagined it differently of course, but it worked as it is and it showed where Sansa and Littlefinger are heading in terms of their future relationship, which is the most important bit. It was nice to see LF's real emotions for a change. I would have preferred Lysa's full speech, along with the story of how her father murdered her child. I think the show audience would think her much less crazy that way, but I guess the aim was to make the audience more sympathetic to the new Bonny and Clyde of the Vale. I missed Marillion song, because I believe it would have added an extra special creepiness to the whole scene. It was an important scene. It should have been longer. Kudos to all the actors, especially Aiden Gillen who was walking a very fine line there. Sweetrobin actor is brilliant. Spot on.
Â 
The Hound story was nicely done. It was great to see Hot Pie again.Â 
Daenerys and Daario lacked a lot. We could not see her passion for him at all. I think most of Daenarys' sequences are weak this season and that is the weakest point of the show at the moment.
Â 
Oberyn/Tyrion exchange was great. It should have been written deeper with the story of marriage proposals, but â<U+0080>¦Â 
Â 
The Wall could have been better in terms of the Craster's aftermath and some dialogues on that.Â
142	gmavridis	2014-05-19	An 8. Best scene was Tyrion / Oberyn. For the setup they have for Eyre the scene between Sansa, Lysa and Littlefinger was good. I don't understand why they didn't use the "Only Cat" version and instead they used the words "Your Sister".
143	Ran	2014-05-19	288 votes, 8.29 average, 9 median, 8.42 normalized average.
144	Gerchon	2014-05-19	3, Overall this season is moving slow with a lot more unrealistic and needless scenes...
145	ipsuel	2014-05-19	Gave it a 9. Couldn't give it a 10 because it wasn't perfect for me (The Mountain, Biter and The Wall weren't great for me). But gheeez, did the other scenes make up for it!
Â 
On re-watch I can't even say which scene was best cuz so many were so great. But Oberyn/Tyrion and Bronn/Tyrion come to mind. And I loved the Hound this ep... it was really great.Â 
Â 
Side note: For the first time since GoT started, a scene almost exactly mirrored what I saw in my mind while reading -- Sansa making her snow castle. It was literally just how I pictured it -- so that's cool :-)
146	Ambria	2014-05-19	8 /10
Almost a 9
Just a couple of scenes bugged me, but man.
Bron- nailed it
Hound - nailed it
Oberyn - nailed it
Fantastic acting by those 3 gentlemen
147	HouseTavarez	2014-05-19	7 / 10
148	Unbowed Unbent Unhodor	2014-05-19	9/10. Best episode of the season so far. I'll have to re-watch though, it sometimes changes on a re-watch
149	OnlyOne	2014-05-19	Â 
Well unless something pretty drastic and shocking happens, I don't see how Arya would have the pure hatred for Sandor in the show that she hadÂ constantlyÂ towards him in the book.

The show keeps pulling and tugging the relationship between Arya and the Hound. Just when they get close, he does something she doesn't approve of. In this episode they seem to get close again, but it's not going to last. And, she did learn about 'mercy' killing. An ominous foreshadowing, don't you think?
150	JonSnowboard	2014-05-19	Arya/Hound...
Â 
Does it not bother anyone else that they have stretched what was effectively 30 brilliant pages of material into an entire season of mostly killer-filler? I feel like the show doesn't respect Arya enough haha...
151	Cyvasse Khal	2014-05-19	4/10 for me (the lowest i've ever given an episode). If I were to judge this based on an average episode of any other series it would be above average. But I need to compare it against other GoT episodes otherwise the 9s and 10s don't mean as much. Really disappointed this week. Almost no flow to the episode, just a series of different story lines chucked in and most of them were not riveting television.
Â 
Positives
- Tyrion's potential champions: Liked all 3 segments. Good dialogue between Tyrion & Jaime/Bronn/Oberyn. Clearly and logically explained why Jaime and Bronn won't do it, and a surprisingly touching end to the Tyrion/Bronn bromance.
- Oberyn: Pedro was fantastic. Emilia take note. That is how you deliver lines flawlessly and build up emotion as the scene goes along.
- Jon: The show has successfully made the transition with Jon to someone who you believe can be a great leader. His good suggestions that you can tell are getting respect from most, but managing to tow the line with Thorne without ruffling feathers is being handled well.
Â 
Negatives
-Meereen: Awful. No exaggeration, just awful. Dany/Daario was just about the most awkward i've seen two actors before, zero chemistry. Why on Earth was Emilia talking so fast with Jorah? I could barely keep up with what she was saying and it was all really hammy. I can't over state how bad I thought Emilia was tonight, and I had just started warming on her again.
-Brienne: These scenes just felt like a bad sitcom with her and Pod. And bringing back Hot Pie? Pointless, and he was really annoying.
-The Wall: Although I liked Jon. How much more do we need to hear that the wildlings are coming? I swear it actually went backwards from they'll be here in Â a few days to they'll be here before the next full moon.
-Melisandre: So very boring. Carise is hot, but pointless nudity HBO.
-Hound/Arya: It felt a bit off tonight. Rorge & Biter 'fight' was really underwhelming. Almost looked like Rorge just walked straight into needle. Don't think the unsullied will be happy knowing The Hound goes because of that bite.
-The Eyrie: I tried to put my finger on what was off about these scenes. And i think i've come to the conclusion that you wouldn't have needed to have read the books to know that slap was coming, that kiss was coming, and that fall down the moon door was coming. They were all set up really predictably.
152	Ser Graymax	2014-05-19	My first 9 of the season!
Â 
About as perfect as it could be with the changes that have been made.
Â 
The Hound remains my favorite but they still dont have a Mountain except in size.Â  Good thing he never says much.
Â 
Dany and Super-Daario scene was the only weak one although I will say Emillia never looked better.Â  Slimmed down (?) good makeup(?) and that dress!!Â  Couldnt stop looking at her belly button.Â  LOL although she sure got cleaned up in a hurry and her hair done after Super-Daario did what he suppossedly does best for 20 seconds.
Â 
Just an aside, not how I pictured the Vail in the past few episodes.Â  The Bloody Gate, the easier approach with the basket elevator missing and even the Moon Door and its room from previous seasons.Â  Still great locations and sets though and dont distract.

153	ladyinblack	2014-05-19	I gave it an 8.
Loved Oberyn- couldn't have found a better actor for the role..perfect
Tyrion scenes continue to impress-great job. Bronn is Bronn & he did tell Tyrion that he was being followed to the ship, a suspect engagement to Lolly is in character & Shae is an overly ambitious bitch so no surprises.
Mereen. Sigh  Dany is not that bad to me but she has zero chemistry w Daario. Daario is so miscast just terrible
Brienne & Pod ok filler w Hot Pie
Eyrie.  Good job  but only Cat needed to be there
154	Robin Of House Hill	2014-05-19	9.675/10. Â The Melisandre segment was the weakest, for me.
155	IlAovatar	2014-05-19	6/10
Â 
- The scenes inside Tyrion's cell were all great.
Â 
- Liked Sansa/Robin's scene, and the moon door incident didn't disappolnt.
Â 
Â 
Â 
- Not so keen on the new Mountain now that we've had a good look at him. He has a better build for the role than the previous Mountains, but because of his Nordic complexion and his age (he looks mature for his age but still reasonably young) I have a very hard time believing that he's Sandor Clegane's brother, let alone older brother. I also hated the not so subtle way they felt they needed to reinforce the fact that he's an evil baddy.
Â 
- I really didn't like how they had Brienne/Podrick encountering Hot Pie and Rorge/Biter running into Sandor/Arya in the same episode. Having characters come together like this always does fantasy worlds a disservice in my opinion and makes the world feel a LOT smaller and less grand than it should be. This isn't just a dig at the show, because GRRM does it too (notably with Samwell bumping into Stark children constantly).
Â 
- Daario was awful as usual.
156	A Man Has Said	2014-05-19	First 9 of the season for me. The weakest stuff was either very brief (the Gregor scene, which was just too cliche to take seriously) or not all that weak at all (mostly it was just kind of weird, like the Rorge scene where he just sort of stands there and has a chat and then dies; I'm thinking Sakharov is homaging something, maybe something from Kurosawa I keep thinking), and the strong stuff was really, really strong (Pedro Pascal hits it out of the park in this one!)


Pedro Pascal was at times channeling Ricardo Montalban in "The Wrath of Khan."
(Cue crane shot)
"LANNisTERRRR! From the heart of perdition I spit at thee."
157	A Redeemed Hound	2014-05-19	Gave it a solid 8. Â Only negatives were Dany and the fact that HBO and Co. can't give it a full fricking hour. Â What gives? Â So much they can do in those 10 extra minutes. Â That is 100 minutes of show we lose because they are all around the 50 min. mark. Â  Think about that.
Â 
But Oberyn was amazing. Â Lysa was amazing. Â Tyrion was amazing. Â Sweet Robin was great. Â I even liked Littlefinger this episode. Â Oberyn stole the show with his story and his announcement. Â Bronn ditching Tyrion was very sad. Â But glad they did it since it's just important to Tyrion's storyline.
158	A Redeemed Hound	2014-05-19	9.675/10. Â The Melisandre segment was the weakest, for me.


Â 
I don't even know what she said. Â A great scene.
159	Ferrum Aeternum	2014-05-19	9/10.Â  Superb episode all around with the exception of the Dany/Daario scene, which felt forced to me.Â  They just don't have believableÂ chemistry.Â 
Â 
Tyrion's scenes with Jaime, Bronn and Oberyn were phenomenal, and theÂ final scenes at the Eyrie (which I've been looking forward to as much as any in recent memory) did not disappoint in the least....well, OK, I'd like to have heard "only Cat" but it was still great television.
160	igrewupinKL	2014-05-19	9- because hot pie
161	Princess of Ice and Fire	2014-05-19	I gave it 8.Â  I enjoyed it and so did my unsullied husband.Â  He immediately worked out that Littlefinger was about to send Lysa flying.Â  I enjoyed most of the episode better than when I read it.Â  Tyrion and Oberyn was a masterly display and I enjoyed Bronn's new clothes.
162	Prince of the North	2014-05-19	First 9 of the season for me. The weakest stuff was either very brief (the Gregor scene, which was just too cliche to take seriously) or not all that weak at all (mostly it was just kind of weird, like the Rorge scene where he just sort of stands there and has a chat and then dies; I'm thinking Sakharov is homaging something, maybe something from Kurosawa I keep thinking), and the strong stuff was really, really strong (Pedro Pascal hits it out of the park in this one!)


I gave this episode a 10.Â  That's mainly because it's the first time this season that I literally said to myself as the episode was ending: "Finally!Â  An episode that I don't have major nitpicks with!"Â  I agree with you about Gregor.Â  If anything that scene had the opposite effect than was intended for me.Â  Rather than being "scary" it was laughable.Â  Gregor is imposing enough just sitting in a chair - there was no need to have him slaughtering untrained smallfolk Â Â  I also agree with you about Pedro Pascal.Â  I thought that was a great scene.
Â 
I haven't read the whole thread so forgive me if this has already been discussed ad nauseum.Â  But what do people think about Rorge and Biter being killedÂ in this ep?Â  Does that add support to the idea that Lady Stoneheart may be written out of the show?Â  Or, at the very least, thatÂ much of Brienne's Feast for Crows activities will be skipped?Â
163	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-19	I am not sure lady stone heart plays a role that is required. They could easily cut that story. I think they will. The actress said she is not coming back so that hints at it too.
164	King Tommen I	2014-05-19	First episode I didn't enjoy an Arya/Hound scene, the dialogue during the gift of mercy was cringeworthy, and the random way Rorge and Bitter show up and die in 10 seconds was lame. Also the season is almost over and Sandor hasn't even mentioned Sansa, not even once, wtf?
Â 
The Eyrie scenes were great, Sophie was amazing as always, but who is going to be framed for Lysa's death? That little detail left me with a bad taste for what it could have been a great ending.Â 
Â 
Brienne and Pod, whatever...there was Hotpie!!! Best part of the episode 
Â 
Tyrion/Jaime and Tyrion/Bronn were ok, but I think Bronn should have explained what the hell happen with ShaeÂ  
Â 
Oberyn was ok, but once he started telling the story I was hoping they mention the reason why the Martell went to Casterly Rock, but they're probably saving that for next episode.
Â 
Edit: change my vote to 7Â 


Â 
I like your synopsis and agree with 90% of it, in particular the Bronn/Tyrion scene...Bronn had some splaining to do!!!
Â 
OTOH, I thoroughly enjoyed the Oberyn/Tyrion scene...damn I'm gonna miss Oberyn!!
(I hope you're right about him giving the reason for their trip to CR)
Â 
Jamie/Tyrion was superb as usual...those two actors really click together and you just feel like they could actually be brothers.
Â 
The first Hound/Arya scene was pretty good up until the "ambush"...weak sauce! Â The second scene was great. Â Have gone from despising the Hound to totally loving the character...another one I'm going to miss!
Â 
Wasn't as big of a fan of the "Hot pie" as you were, scene was a total snooze...sorry.
Â 
Same goes for the intro of The Mountain. Â I didn't feel dread or was impressed with him other than his size. Â Slaughtering guys who obviously were not trained combatants didn't impress me much. Â Sure, the character is pure evil and will kill anyone for anything, but I was hoping for a little more to that scene than what we got.
Â 
The Eyrie was only so-so....."your sister" instead of "only Cat"....wth???
Â 
Grade: Â 8/10

					
					
							Edited by King Tommen I, 19 May 2014 - 09:59 AM.
165	Lady of the Veil	2014-05-19	9 -- I enjoyed the intriguing aspects such as and in this order:
Â 
Â Â Â Â  a. Trial By Combat! All seemed lost when Tyrion realized Cersei got to Bronn. Not sure he could handle the Mountain (Se Gregor) anyway. The Viper on the other hand is fueled by revenge and retaliation. He's no physical match for Ser Gregor but Prince Oberyn must have some tricks up his sleeve as a Master Poisoner. Anyway that story he told Tyrion showed just how sick and toxic Family Lannister is and if Tyrion EVER gets out of this one I do hope he vacates King's Landing once and for all!
Â 
Â Â  b. Lyssa Out the Moon Door -- But prior to that at long last we know Littlefinger lusts after Sansa the Cateyln Stark sex surrogate. How will they ever explain what went down though? I saw the teaser with Sansa addressing aÂ  council of sorts and saying that Lord Baelish was "lying" and something about she must tell the truth. HmmmÂ  (Thoughts?)
Â 
Â  c. Love the burgeoning brutality of Arya! The Hound's backstory is pretty good. He was the unfavored one compared to the Mountain? Always wondered how he got that scar. Thought ot was in battle come to find out his own bro did it to him!Â  (P.S.) I really want Arya and Sansa to re-connect!
Â 
Â d. Lady Brienne keeps denying she's a Knight. Like Hotpie (basically) said if it the shoe fits, wear it. Thought it so sweet that Hotpie sent a Direwolf "yummy"Â to Arya via Lady Brienne and Podrick. Podrick is generally right, though....Brienne got lucky this time but no need to run off at the mouth about the Quest for Arya.
Â 
Â e. Bored by Dany + Daario scene. Why not just show the sex? Oh that's right, Emilia ClarkeÂ will no longer drop trou for the cameras! (LOL)Â 
Â 
Â f. Melisandre and Selsye bonded over the bath? So what's up with Melisandre wanting to bring Stannis' deformed child into the magic fold?Â  Carice Van Houten always did nude scenes, she'sÂ European but normally she does full frontal, that was some years ago though. I recall a scene inÂ a movie where CVH was shown dying her pubes to match her blonde hair in some holocaust-war themed movie. She basically played a Mata Hari type.
Â 
g. Jamie isÂ now cool with me until he starts shaggin' his sis. (Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!) Twincest does not rule.Â Â
166	lord ross of house stark	2014-05-19	Where was marimillion when lysa went flying
167	Beric175	2014-05-19	9/10, just for Bronn, The Hound, Oberyn, Tyrion, SansaÂ and even Littlefinger all hitting it right out of the park with their performances. All the sansa stuff this year has been very well done and while I've seen some unsullied complain about sansa getting bratty again over "just a snow castle" I can seethat all the anger that has built up in her under Joffrey she unleashes onto Sweetrobin who while not exactly a 100%Â douche like Joffrey, is being very arrogant and douchey at least in the moment. While he is right that a small tower is no big deal and that he did not "ruin" it, he still was petulant and impulsively aggressive when she lashed out at him. In one sense I cannot totally condemn him but I can understand sansa more, given her present situation and the awareness that she has of it in general. I could see that when he came to her she wanted to be alone with her memories of a sweeter time and the moment was ultimately ruined by him showing up at all, given that he so nonchalantly talked to her about her family's death the moment they met. It frustrates me a little that the subtle scA¨nes with sansa that are open to interpretation are usually reduced by the unsullied viewers as bratty teenage behavior, not considering that she has had a rough time at the vry least recently, with being aware of people's belief as to her implication in Joffrey's death, the death of Ser Dontos, who she arguably saved from death and the destruction of Winterfell that we are always reminded of in the opening credits because it is a permanent thing to her as well and it's tough to get over a loss like that one. I think we can take away from this that sansa is starting to stand up for herself more, just because she's done dealing with petty little psychos like Joffrey and Robert.
Â 
Now Littlefinger's move here is interesting, not just because we are not sure if he is expressing feelings for sansa in the book, for Catelyn or if he is even expressing any true feelings at all here, given that having Lysa freak out over this kiss (and he knows that Robert will go straight to her to bring her here) and try to have Sansa killed is the perfect way for him to act on what we already suspected in episode 5: his absolute distaste for Lysa that he only puts up with because it allows him to marry into a powerful family with control over a region as of yet untouched by the war.Â He will be Lord protector of the vale once she dies. So either it's a fit of passion, in which case he forgot himself with sansa, which goes against much of what we know of this calm and usually careful man, or it was a planned move to provoke in Lysa exactly the kind of reaction she ended up having. I also would like to point out that Lysa implicates herself in the deaths of Sansa's mother and Sansa's uncle Jon so the confession scenario came about in a different way for which I am very grateful.Â I don't even mind them leaving out "only Cat" because that's them putting their spin on the story and it changes nothing between him here and the books if he says "your sister". The effect is the same and apart from a nod to the books, nothing gets lost.
Â 
I didn't think we'd get Oberyn telling the story of Tyrion as a baby but it was well-written, well-acted and well-placed because Tyrion is in a tough spot right now and both this, Jaime'sÂ and Bronn's scenesÂ were wonderful in communicating his growing despair so that when Oberyn offers his service to Tyrion, it's a wonderful moment of hope....that will get crushed in 2 weeks sadly and I will be very sad because PedorÂ Pascal, Martin and the writers for the showÂ have made him an excellent character on the show and treated the character with a lot of respect, which I am very thankful for.
Â 
The Jon scene once again emphasises what a bully Alliser Thorne is to everyone around him and it is a good way to build the tension because we know that in episode 9 a giant will come running though that tunnel and we'll go "had you guys just paid a bit more heed to Jon's warnings".
Â 
I never thought reading AFFC that Brienne was brilliant and it's nice to see that she sort of has to rely on Pod to some extent and the inconsistencies like her asking for sansa Stark in public are pointed out as a bad approach by Pod later so it makes him more useful because otherwise Brienne does not really need him so it justifies his presence. Anyone else thinks it's like Sancho Panza and Don Quixote?
Â 
The Arya and the Hound scenes were both fine (even thoughÂ I would have preferred seeing Brienne dispose of Rorge and Biter but whatever, at least the Hound got wounded badly enoug to "die" of the festering wound in the next episode). It's also great to have the Hound tell his own story and we at least now know the father's involvement in all of this, which mirrors Tywin's treatment of Tyrion when compared to Jaime, something Tyrion even points outat the beginning and we can already see that he is getting insulting with both Bronn and Jaime to some extent. For now he will still hold back to some extent but once Jaime reveals the Tysha bit we'll get the more questionable and angry Tyrion for sure.
Â 
the only slight misstep was the Melisandre scene but it added flavour to characters who we otherwise never see interact and the nudity would not be a problem for Selyse other than the fact that she might be jealous of melisandre or was the idea of Mel talking about magic tricks and illusions mixed with the image of her youthful body meant as a nod towards her glamour, since she is actually using magic to keep herself younger than she actually is?
Â 
Is it wrong thatÂ I enjoy Cersei walking though the guts of dead prisoners? NB: the new Mountain is HUUUUGE.
168	Pablosplinter	2014-05-19	7. All of the Tyrion stuff was excellent. The Brienne scene was quite good. The Wall I didn't like. Mel scene was poor and useless.
Â 
Getting sick of Arya/Hound just wasting time.
Â 
Disappointed with the end, as 'Only Cat' would have been much more epic imo.
169	Ugly Little Girl	2014-05-19	10. 
Just perfect, and oh! The feels!
170	DolorousKim	2014-05-19	This episode had quite a few crucial scenes, and the pressure was on the show to deliver in an epic fashion.Â  In my opinion, they completely nailed every one of the key scenes.Â  I rated this episode a 10, the first "perfect" score that I've given since Season Two's Blackwater.Â  This is my favorite episode so far this season, and is easily in my top 10, perhaps top 5, for the series overall.
Â 
What really, really worked for me:
Â 
My top slot has to go to the Tyrion/Bronn farewell scene - This scene is my "building the snow Winterfell" scene, so I was really anxious for the show to get this one right: I can happily state that I was not disappointed in the least.Â  Both Dinklage and Flynn were perfect in their performances -- the emotional level was subtly and deftly built throughout the scene, both verbally and non-verbally (the awkward body language and lack of the trademark smirk on Bronn's part, for example).Â  By the end, the scene succeeded in conveying the fact that the two shared a friendship far beyond the employer/mercenary relationship that they started out with, and did so without descending into cheesy over-sentimentality.Â  I was actually more moved by the show scene than by the book scene, which is not something that I find myself saying often.
My second slot goes to the Oberyn/Tyrion cell visit - Is Peter Dinklage having a great year, or what?Â  His performances for the past two weeks have exceeded my ability to come up with new descriptive superlatives.Â  And the best part?Â  Pedro Pascal absolutely matched the lofty level of Dinklage's performance every step of the way.Â  Great, great scene!
My third slot goes to the Arya/Hound scenes - I've said it before, and I'll undoubtedly say it again before this season is out, but the dynamics of the Hound/Arya relationship are probably my favorite of the whole show this season.Â  To me, these two are like fierce warriors from opposing tribes - they respect each other, even have some regard for each other, but at the end of the day, they are on different sides, and can't ever really be allies in the long term.Â  Maisie Williams and Rory McCann were superb yet again this week.Â  Unlike what others have stated above, I really enjoyed the gift of mercy scene, even if it was a shade less strong than the scene featuring The Hound's confession of how he received his injury at the hands of his brother.Â  I also thought that whoever the gentleman was that played the dying man did a wonderful job with his portrayal.Â  Both scenes really pushed the correct emotional buttons for me.
My Fourth slot goes to the Sansa/Peter/Robin/Lysa scene - Despite a few minor changes (minor to me, anyway), I really thought that the show did justice to an incredibly powerful set of scenes from the book.Â  Aidan Gillen's performance has has gotten a lot of criticism on this site, but I thought that he was wonderfully creepy and pitch-perfect as pervy Peter this week.Â  Kate Dickie is so damn convincing as crazy Lysa that if I ever should happen to bump into this actress walking down the street in real life, I would probably cross to the other side.
My Fifth slot goes to Jaime's visit to Tyrion - Like Peter Dinklage, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is also having a stellar year, and through the performances of these two, this scene really drove home just how desperate life has gotten for the Lannister boys, and just how desolate of hope the unfolding of events have become for them as well.Â  It also served as a reminder of how strong the bond of brotherhood has remained between these two.Â  Wonderful scene!
My Sixth and final slot goes to Iain Glen, for delivering a stupendous rendition of "why you just can't kill all of the slavers that you see."Â  It's about time that the actor got to sink his chops into some real dialogue for a change.Â  He was so good, that he all but blasted Emilia's one-note "bad-ass teenaged conqueror-queen" vocal inflection out of my memory, and saved the Meereen scene from being laughably bad.
What didn't work for me:
The only criticism that I have regards Emilia Clarke's sudden inability to change her vocal inflection regardless of the nature of the dialogue that she's delivering.Â  Whether she's trying to seduce a sellsword or asking for advice from her most trusted friend, everything sounds like she's issuing an order in a tone of voice that's overcompensating for the fact that she's just a clueless young woman who no one would follow if she didn't have dragons.Â  We've seen her perform far, far better in the past, so what gives??Â  It's like we're right back to her second season performance, which was a huge step back from her first season performance, but where she at least had the excuse that she had nothing to do but wander around in the wastelands spewing about being the "blood of the dragon, etc., etc...
171	The Great Unwashed	2014-05-19	I am as yet unable to assign a rating to this episode, mainly because of how uneven it was.Â  The good stuff in the episode was amazing...Jaime and Tyrion, Bronn and Tyrion, Oberyn and Tyrion, the whole of the Eyrie scenes, Arya and the Hound sans the Rorge and Biter bit...and the bad stuff was atrociously bad.
Â 
I mean, the scene with the Mountain was so over-the-top it was practically farce...do we even know who those men wereÂ he was killing?Â  I assume they were prisoners, but you'd think that even in Westeros it would be at least mildly frowned upon for an anointed knight to be butchering unarmed men within the castle walls, especially if the castle isn't being sacked...not to mention that you know that Lord Tywin would keep a much shorter leash on his mad dog than that.
Â 
The Dany and Daario scene seemed like it was cut from a bad porno...probably something titled "One Knight in Daenerys".Â  I seriously kept expecting Daario to pull out a wrench and announce that he was there to fix her pipes.
Â 
And I'm very disappointed that Arya and the Hound didn't stop to loot the Cloak of Invisibility that Rorge and Biter were wearing.Â  Those two just appeared out of nowhere...and then, after rolling a natural 1 on their sneak attack attempt, Rorge stands there and faces down a fully armored Hound in naught but his knickers...or near enough anyway...instead of trying to running to live and fight another day.
Â 
Inexplicable change of Jon being the one advocating sealing up the Wall, but that's neither here nor there.
Â 
The Pod/Brienne/Hot Pie stuff was decent, as was the Melisandre/Selyse interaction.
172	aFeastForDragons	2014-05-19	9/10
Â 
Oberyn and Tyrion was incredible. Best scene they've ever done in the show. You could really feel the emotion.
Hot Pie and the inn was really good
Arya and The Hound was great. Little disappointed with killing Rorge and Biter since they play quite a big part in AFFC but with the Bloody Mummers not in it they can be killed.
Selyse and Mel was good. A little to cryptic but at least they don't say where it is they are going.
The Dany scene was good. A little to evil though. Dany's not supposed to be "Blood and Fire" yet and I don't remember her diving into bed with Daario so easily.
Dany and Jorah was great.Â 
Â 
All in all a great episode.
Â 
I haven't watched the last 10 minutes though.

173	rmholt	2014-05-19	I am not sure lady stone heart plays a role that is required. They could easily cut that story. I think they will. The actress said she is not coming back so that hints at it too.

She did not say that. She teased a little. Right now she's busy killing people in events that happen in real time. Maybe she doesn't know - though D&D no doubt know.
174	Carey Snow	2014-05-19	Great show. Sansa's snow castle is one of my fave chapters in the books, and they did a great job with it. When Sansa is building Winterfell I cried a little (of course I cried more in the books where you get her inner thoughts). Dany was awesome, loved Arya and the Hound. Very good episode.
Â 
10 for me.

the last 10 minutes are great.
176	RhaenysBalerion	2014-05-19	Somewhere between 8 and 9, but I just went with 8.Â 
Â 
I just missed that mind blown feeling. And I also got the impression that it was pretty repetitive. And then there were the absolute filler scenes. Yes. I'm glad I went with 8. It was amusing though, made me laugh out loud a couple times. Sophie Turner was amazing in the garden scene, Cersei was finally truly Cersei. I really liked Bronn and Tyrion and Hot Pie is a sweetheart.Â
177	GeorgeIAF	2014-05-19	Gave it a 8 , really enjoyed it , good episode to set up what's next
178	sj4iy	2014-05-19	I am not sure lady stone heart plays a role that is required. They could easily cut that story. I think they will. The actress said she is not coming back so that hints at it too.


Â 
Yet Lene Headey posted a pic on her instagram with a picture of stones shaped into a heart. Â I don't see how Stoneheart gets cut, she's too important to Brienne and Jamie's plot line. Â Of course Michelle Fairley said she wasn't coming back...her character is supposed to be dead. Â That's the point XD
179	sj4iy	2014-05-19	Inexplicable change of Jon being the one advocating sealing up the Wall, but that's neither here nor there.


Â 
I don't think it's inexplicable. Â In the books, Marsh wanted to do it well after the war with the Wildlings was over. Â Here, Jon's advocating doing so makes sense given what they are facing.
180	Ran	2014-05-19	400 votes in, 8.32 average, 9 median, 8.45 normalized average.
181	Shebara	2014-05-19	Gave it a 10, for me personally the best episode so far - even did beat the Nights King.
Â 
I personally don t care if the Hizdahr story is altered, I think it will lead to the same point in Mereen, the battle of fire...I think the Harpies story is not soooo important - in any case they did not introduce the Green Grace so far, so I think they will leave it out, but it is not essential for the progress of the story.
Â 
Once again I was impressed by the overall brilliant acting! Arya, the Hound, Littlefinger, Sansa, Bronn, Tyrion, the Red Viper...they all rocked!
Â 
I was so touched by the sequence of heartbreaking scenes at the end: first the goodbye of Bronn and Tyrion, then the Red Viper and Tyrion (absolutely brilliant!) and then ...one of my favorite scenes from the books - Sansas Snowcastle and Lysas flight...I was close to tears after all those scenes!
Â 
Well, now we know how the Hound received his mortal wound, he will die for his fear of fire at last cause he did not let Arya burn his wound. They became pretty close again those 2, the Hound even told her his story!
Â 
The only big negative plot for me was the absence of the singer Marillion in the moondoor scene: I wonder what story Sansa and LF will tell to explain Lysas flight....well but it also ends speculations that Marillion is still alive somewhere and still has some role to play....
Â 
In any case: for me personally this episode was brilliant!
182	The Red Kraken	2014-05-19	Finally an episode for book readers! Loved this episode. Thought it was the strongest of the season so far. Pascal and Dinklage owned it! Finally a good scene between the two of them.Â 
The Mountain scene was cartoonish to say the least, but that was my biggest problem.
Not the least bit bothered by the lack of "action". I personally don't watch this show for boobs and random acts of violence. I love the story and the characters. Which D&D don't really seem to care about anymore.
Wish more episodes this season were this loyal to the story.
183	Greywolf2375	2014-05-19	Overall this was a very strong episode...nothing is perfect, but this one was good.Â  Any of the scenes in the jail cell were nailed.
Â 
Sansa/Castle/Robin seemed a little rushed, but was done very well.Â  I would have preferred seeing the giant because of the theories involved around foreshadowing, etc but they did it well.
Â 
Moondoor...didn't like they didn't use "Only Cat" & the scene also felt rushed but in the end Lysa did fly.Â  Course for me this is a point where the journey of this one didn;t live up to the destination.
Â 
Arya/Hound v Rorge/Biter....I'll be disappointed if the bite is what takes him down & Rorge standing there to get stabbed was weak, but the Arya/Hound dynamic is great.
Â 
Mel/Selyse...that was interesting.Â  Said it somewhere else, sort of let on that some of Mel's powers come from powders & vials...
Â 
8/10.

Yes, it was really true to the book.
185	Miss Carnahan	2014-05-19	5
Â 
The first 30 minutes weren't terribly interesting or exciting. Lovely to see Hot Pie once again (quite liked his kidney pie speech). The "only cat" scene was really good, even though he didn't actually say "only cat" and Sansa didn't actually hear the "Jon Arryn" reveal. I'm really surprised that they added the Sansa/Petyr kiss though, because she was only 17 then. But the scene that was absolutely perfect, was the interaction between Oberyn and Tyrion. Perfect acting from both of them. Too bad next episode will be Pedro Pascal's last, because he's been really enjoyable to watch these last couple of episodes.

Â 
I don't think there's any problem with a minor kissing an adult on screen (if she's even considered a minor at 17). Â "Interview with the Vampire" had a little girl kissing Brad Pitt, iirc.

Â 
Ah yes, but after they somewhat softened the Sansa/Hound scenes, I thought they would do the same with this one.
188	Julia Caesar	2014-05-19	9/10.
Â 
Oberyn/Pedro absolutely amazing! Can't wait, yet dreading the return from the Memorial Day break!Â 
Sansa/Castle/ Littlefinger equally amazing with a touch of creep factor. Didn't mind the 'Your Sister' at all.
Only part that was meh for me- Cersei's walk thru guts/Mountain slaughter fest. That andÂ 'take off your clothes' Daario
scene.
189	Alizard Erebys	2014-05-19	Just out of curiosity, is this thread supposed to be without spoilers????
190	Steve Stark	2014-05-19	An 8. Would have been lower probably, since there were a few slightly awkward scenes, but Tyrion and Oberyn boosted it with their performance...and as usual, Daenerys' beauty was enough to make me happy as well. I'm not even a massive Dany fan, but Emilia Clarke....that woman is beautiful. Makes me hate the new Daario actor even more, because he gets to be with her. Bastard.

Â 
You are right, she show misses a lot of the details (Sansa slaying the giant, the story why Oberyn and Elia were visiting the Rock etc...) but most of that is due to the fact that the show could never show all the details of the 5 books - the show has to tell the story in a much simplier way. Nevertheless the direction is the same, books (if ever finished!) and TV show will come to the same bittersweet ending - GRRM would never allow the show to have a different ending to his forseen ending!
But I can only advise only-show-watchers to try to read the books eventually (take your time - GRRM does with the last 2 books  ) if you really want to warg into those wonderful characters and slip into the world of Westeros/Essos!

194	King Redbeard I	2014-05-19	Voted a 7. Pretty decent episode, excited for the next one. Not going to be on for 2 weeks though, right?
Â 
Thought it was pretty exciting, liked the scene between Petyr and Lysa, though it all happened a bit quick. Same with the scene between Tyrion and Oberyn.
195	Rashtibram	2014-05-19	The Dany and Daario scene seemed like it was cut from a bad porno...probably something titled "One Knight in Daenerys".Â  I seriously kept expecting Daario to pull out a wrench and announce that he was there to fix her pipes.


This was funny. QFT. But I think it was my only criticism.
Â 
This was an excellent seven for me. The dialogue and acting in the final two seasons were exquisite.

198	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-05-19	9/10
The first Arya/Hound scene sucked, mostly because of Rorge and Biter, but the second one was great IMO. The Mountain scene was odd and cartoonish and the Dragonstone scene was also odd and seemed like an excuse to show some boobs. Jon was meh.
I loved Hot Pie, Aiden Gillen was great as Littlefinger and every Tyrion scene was fucking amazing.

Oh, the real guy - yeah.
201	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-05-19	I will also say I don't get the Aiden Gillen hate around here. People say his accent fluctuates and maybe I don't notice or something, but it's just not that big a deal to me. I think he's doing a powerful job as Littlefinger.
202	BetterthanPodrick	2014-05-19	People said the same thing about Shae and Tyrion, but they managed to twist that around. I don't think this complaint is fair.


I suspect arya may actually give the Hound "the gift" in the show version and there will be no future gravedigger..... He made a point of showing her where the heart is
203	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-19	9/10 for me. This was my favourite of this season by far, and perhaps even from all previous seasons too. 
My only critiques would be the random appearance and death of Rorge (and I assume Biter too) as well as the Gregor scene, which seemed bizarre and looked almost like one of those flims where you feed sacrifices to a caged beast...odd to say the least!
Dany scene wasnt terrible or great, but the rest of the episode was fantastic. Tyrion and Oberyn, Tyrion and Bronn, Tyrion and Jaime. Pedro Pascal in particular stole his scene. 
 Sansa and Sweetrobin was well done imo, glad they kept the kiss. Only Cat was brilliant, even without the signature line  And I'm left wondering who will take the blame, and also fearing for Shireen...
Great episode
204	Hard Hugh	2014-05-19	I gave it a 7. I thought the Tyrion/Oberon scene was incredible. Same for Tyrion Bronn. Gregor was decent definitely looked the part more than the previous seasonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s actor. I couldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t help myself watching the return of Hotpie. Even if it was a tad convenient I thought it came off well and I loved the subtitle smile from Breinne at the end. Â More and more I am appreciating this change from the book that gave Brienne and Pod more opportunity to establish a working relationship. 
For the bad. I really felt like the Errie scenes were a bit ham fisted and rushed. I know it would be hard to portray but Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s castle building with LF really was important to establishing her growth for meâ<U+0080>¦a pinnacle moment when she wanted to believe she had someone she could trust and then it was ripped away. I feel like this made it seem like she was more open to the concept of Littlefinger romantically then I read it. It just seemed to happen so fastâ<U+0080>¦maybe because they wanted the â<U+0080><U+009C>cliffhangerâ<U+0080><U+009D> pun intended. I also wonderâ<U+0080>¦..without a fall guyâ<U+0080>¦how will LF talk his way out of this?
205	King Redbeard I	2014-05-19	I don't know if this is the right place to say this, and please, if it's not, feel free to delete my comment or point me to another thread, but who cares if Littlefinger said "your sister" instead of "only Cat"? If you've been paying attention, you know that Cat was Lysa's sister... So does it really matter?
206	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-05-19	That sounds like an argument more in favor of the original line.
207	Davrum	2014-05-19	7
Â 
Too many scenes felt clunky, the Jon scene felt like a waste of time, the new Daario bores me, the Eyrie scenes felt undercooked and the Rorge and Biter attack was clumsily presented and there was no Tywin.
Â 
On the plus side before Rorge and Biter arrived to cramp their style the Arya/Hound stuff was great, Sophie Turner managed to once again stand out even while not-great scenes played out around her and the scenes with both Bronn and Oberyn visiting Tyrion were some of the best the show has ever done.
208	Gannicus	2014-05-19	A soft episode overall that was saved by Oberyn.
209	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-05-19	Gave this a 9 and it was my favourite episode of the season so far. And despite all that blood and thunder last week regarding Dinklage's performance at the trial, for me his performance tonight in the three scenes with his potential 'champions' was stellar. He is SO much better when he underplays. I think the moving scene between him and Pedro was outstanding
This was an episode that examined the subtle changes in relationships between characters and I lap stuff like this up any day of the week. 
The wall and Mountain scenes were the weakest: the Wall in particular felt as though it was pushed in to remind the audience that Mance is still coming (him and winter!) and didn't advance anything plot wise. The Mountain scene was also a little hamfisted - oh, better remind the audience who this big bad bastard is. Other than these, I thought there was a good flow to the episode .  And I didn't even mind the Dany scene tonight although it was not among my favourites, but again, Emilia is trying....  
The episode has done a good job in setting up the big plot points for the end of the season, which I have high hopes for.  
But now it's two whole weeks to wait. Ouch !
210	The Killer Snark	2014-05-19	I give this one an easy 10, as it's one of the strongest episodes of the series so far, if not the strongest I've seen yet. Beautifully scripted and acted, thrilling, constantly engaging, completely sensitive to the source material, the way the series should be: and even the Brienne and Pod ramblings were a joy. It had sexy stuff, it had violence, it had big emotional moments, it had the Mountain. All of the finest dialogue in key scenes of the novels was preserved; each scene was perfect in all ways. This was just the kick the season needed after the disappointingly patchy near-fanfic of last week, with its Monty Pythonesque failed Dreadfort rescue mission. And what a heart-soaring double-whammy in the Tyrion/Oberyn and Eyrie scenes at the end.

211	Fevre River Warrior	2014-05-19	Hot Pie! I thought this was a great espisode and really loved seeing Hot Pie, and then seeing Arya kill Rorge. Tyrion with Jamie, then Bronn and then the magnificent performance by Pedro Pascal .....all were great. And the scene at the end, I was so hoping we would see Lysa thrown through the Moon Door, I was really hoping they would follow the books. I wonder what they will to with no Marillion....and how Littlefinger will get out of this. I think it was very well done. Maybe we see he change in Sansa starting earlier than in the books.
Â 
And the Biter got the Hound instead of who he gets in the books.....
Â 
A week break, then 3 more episodes. I am really enjoying this season.
Â 
And just what is Mel planning for Shireen? She better leave that little girl alone......

I agree.
I also liked Tyrion and Bronn. Sansa and Littlefinger scene was ok. Gregor was too over the top. Daario is boring.

Â 
yes why have daario at all... tyrion and bronn was expected ...felt sorry for tyrion but understood bronn's point
Â 
sansa and little finger was perfect but moon door scene was a let down....
Â 
...just my opinion...Â
215	jarl the climber	2014-05-19	ok 8 of 10...i would have liked a little more with tyrion and jamie and felt let down by the moon door where was the singer to blame it on.... a problem for me
Â 
...though just this asshole's opinion...feel free to disagree...Â  


I disagree, I don't think your an asshole but if I ever catch you kissing on my flowers

Â 
"Your sister" is completely sensitive to the source material?
Â 
I DEMAND YOU BE OUTRAGED WITH THE REST OF US!!!
217	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-05-19	Yeah the new Mountain looks like a big teddy bear compared to that last dude in season 1 who I felt nailed that part.
218	IlAovatar	2014-05-19	I will also say I don't get the Aiden Gillen hate around here. People say his accent fluctuates and maybe I don't notice or something, but it's just not that big a deal to me. I think he's doing a powerful job as Littlefinger.


I didn't get the complaints about his accent at all until this episode. He sounded so Irish at one point, i'm amazed they didn't re-shoot the scene.
219	The Dragon Prince	2014-05-19	I gave this episode a 10/10. I loved every scene.
220	Ser Jake	2014-05-19	Didn't get to watch it live, just finished watching it. I thought it was really great. My only complaint, and it's really not a complaint at all, is that Littlefinger didn't give the "Only Cat" line before pushing Lysa out the Moon Door. Episode was great though, both of Tyrion's scenes were incredible and the Arya/Hound stuff was really good, ending was great as well. Brienne/Pod stuff was also quite enjoyable, nice to see Hot Pie again.
221	Lord Devannious	2014-05-19	Thought this was a filler episode. Â Not to much happened, I say the only things worth watching was the scene with Arya and Rorge, and I suppose the Lysa and Sansa moon door scene was cool too. Â Other then that it was pretty much just blah. blah. blah. Â Sucks we have to wait 2 weeks for the next episode, these next 3 episodes will be epic.
222	StrollofShame	2014-05-19	I wish they'd decided to please everyone and have Petyr say, 'Only your sister...', then as he is actually pushing her out the door, add 'Only CAT!' --the word CAT punctuated by the shove. But I side with those who think in the long run, it won't really make a difference. Pretty sure Lysa got the point, regardless.
223	lostinwesteros	2014-05-19	I'm left wondering who LF will blame for pushing Lysa out the moon door. Â Couldn't get enough detail from the preview of 4:08 that showed Sansa talking to a group of men/lords (?) to really tell how it was going down. Â Like many have said, it would have been nice to have more Sansa/Winterfell snow castle time, but it made me happy just to think what it would have been like for her to see snow again!
Â 
I liked the entire episode, really, but even though I usually love the Sandor/Arya scenes, I thought the attack by Biter and Rorge was a bit weak. Â When Arya stabbed Rorge, it just didn't seem to go deep enough to kill him, but I guess that's mostly due to her just having learned from Sandor where the heart is so that it went in just the right spot, and the fact that Needle is just so much smaller than a 'regular' blade, it looks a bit 'puny' in comparison in a long range camera shot. Â 
Â 
Can't wait for LS. Â Some posters seem to think we won't get her till next season?
224	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-05-19	I'm thinking LS will rise in episode 10. Hopefully they deviate from the "End the season with a Dany scene formula" to let her resurrection scene be the last one for this season.
225	Skoboe	2014-05-19	8.
Â 
Rorge and Biter...two sensational characters relegated to a footnote. The rest was pretty good.

i think that it would be perfect to show her in the last scene in the finale of this season. she's already been mentioned a few times so i think they are building up to her appearance.

229	conwaysuccess	2014-05-19	One of my favorite episodes, best for this season so far!Â Â Â  Great acting!Â  I love the chemistry with the hound and Arya.Â  Peter is so awesome!Â  He does an amazing job at showing how tormented he feels and how determined too...For aÂ twisted character you really feel for him and see how his love created his person.Â
230	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-19	Brilliant
Tyrion/Oberyn
Â 
Positive:
Jaime/Tyrion - Brilliantly done by both
The dog and the wolf - 'Nothing' line wasn't as bad as I feared but not fantastic. 'Mercy' set up I was happy with. Rorge/Biter set up was weak and almost enough to move scene down a rank
Wall - timely reminder for people that may have been deluded into thinking of Jon as a 'badass', that he is in fact not.
Bronn/Tyrion - very well done scene
Mel/Sel - surprised I felt this as a positive, but it gave a great insight into their characters. No if only they could do the same for the protagonist there for once as well.
The dog and the wolf 2 - Really liked it and sets up well for Arya being unable to act later.
Brienne/Pod/Hot Pie - Nice scene that tied things up well. Probably the weakest GC has ever been in the show though. Could have done with a bit more fear from Hot Pie when he heard the name 'Stark' perhaps.
Snow Winterfell - Started out as brilliant but I don't know - it seemed to lose a bit by the end. Still definitely in the +ve territory.
Only Cat - great scene. Would have preferred they didn't change that line but it wasn't a deal breaker.Â 
Negative:
Dany/Daario - in two minds though. It might actually be perfect. It was at this point I lost all interest in Book Dany so it could be argued the show is being faithful
Â 
Neutral:
Cersei/Gregor - OKish but questions about why he needs 'training' after 3 years of killing peasants and farmers' children. Mountain V3.0 ok but Conan was still the best
Jorah/Dany - scene saved from -ve territory by Jorah's truth bombs and Glenn's delivery, but only just. Tempo and delivery of Dany's lines just seemed awkward to me somehow..
Â 
Summary: I think it is the best of the season so far. In truth perhaps an 8.5 but I will give it a 9 on first viewing.
231	Mr Hodor	2014-05-19	One of the major differences from the book is that my unsullied friends do not know who the mountain is. Some of them even dont know that mountain and hound are bothers. But most importantly they dont feel the terror that the mountain inspires. He is just another character for them at this point.
232	LaffsAtBookReaders	2014-05-20	Loved the tyrion and bronns rational nature. Favorite dialogue of the season so far for me lol
233	Ran	2014-05-20	485 votes in, 8.32 average, 9 median, 8.44 normalized average.
234	JonDunn	2014-05-20	Jorah saved that scene with Dany, I agree.
Â 
Â 
I don't know what's up with Dany, her acting imo has gotten noticably worse since getting to Meereen.
Â 
It's like Emilia has read the books and knows she is supposed to get more unlikable? lol
235	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-05-20	I gave it a 7. It was a good setup episode with numerous strong scenes. I particularly enjoyed Tyrion's scenes with Oberyn and with Bronn.
I disliked the scene with Mel and Stan's wife. It was a bit too on the nose IMO.
236	Barbossa	2014-05-20	8 - enjoyed all the scenes, surprising even Brienne and Pod
Â 
Last 3 episodes are gonna be amazing.
Â 
Â 


Â 
9 for me, and yeah i like Brienne and Pod also even though i hate them so far. The Dragonstone scenes were just poor in comparison so that's why the 9 in my book.
Â 
Got seasons are just like a good wine, they get better as time passes:D
237	The Killer Snark	2014-05-20	That Tyrion and Oberyn scene was absolutely brilliant, especially; it just walked straight from the pages of the novel. "Tyrion, I will be your champion", and then the look of reiief and gratitude on the face of Tyrion as he realizes he has an unexpected friend left. Peter Dinklage has always been exceptional, but I can't think of a better Oberyn they could have chosen than Pedro Pascal.
238	Bastard of Savolax	2014-05-20	I gave it a 8/10.Â 
Â 
Notable pros:
Â 
The interaction between Tyrion and all three of his potential champions, especially Bronn and Oberyn. Good stuff.
Â 
Notable cons:Â 
Â 
I didnÂ´t except Rorge and Biter to be prominent in the show, but the way they disposed of them was just bizarre. It was laughably bad and random.Â 
The reintroduction of The Mountain was somewhat cartoonish and the actor playing him doesnÂ´t quite fit the role.Â 
They really didnÂ´t need to show Jon and the Wall at all if nothing important happens in the storyline. Felt unnecessary.
Â 
The rest was pretty solid TV. Thus an 8. Â

239	Bonifer Tasty	2014-05-20	Gave it an 8. Â Oberyn/Tyrion had me really worked up, thought it was great. Â Lots of the rest was ok, but did think that moon door scene was oddly rushed. Â The story at the wall is getting kind of lame - and where was Maester Aemon on the panel?
240	Ryuho Martell	2014-05-20	8.
The Rorge scene and the lack of "Only Cat" kept me from giving it a 9.
241	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-05-20	I'm not nearly as offended as most are over the "only cat" omission, I thought the omission of Catelyn screaming Ned and about her hair was worse, but that scene was so powerful by Fairly it really took nothing away from it.  I scored this episode a 9.  Would have liked to have seen Dany's tits and ass instead of Daario's, and the new Gregor is probably the biggest joke of the entire series thus far, but oh well.  Overall Tyrion and Oberyn's scene was the shiznit, fuggit, every scene with Tyrion this season has been 100% gold.  Maybe he is the only Lannister that shit's gold.  Hot Pie was awesome, that scene was awesome, overall great episode.

243	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-20	I think the Arya/Hound arc has run it's course it's time for Arya to head to a local porte and board a ship too Braavos.


Â 
There is one vitally important sequence to do first.
244	solidviper	2014-05-20	I always rate based on how much I enjoy other episodes, and a 5/10 means average for me.
Â 
That said, this week I gave it a 6/10. Slightly above average (due to the Tyrion/Oberyn scene and Lysa scene), but no where near the intensity of the courtroom for me. (last week it was a 8 for me).
245	Hielo y Fuego	2014-05-20	Excellent episode. 2nd. best this season behind the PW, IMO.
Â 
So many great nods to the books (i.e: Bronn's betrothal to Llolys, the Hound telling his tragic tale, Oberyn telling the story of the "little monster"). Tyrion/Oberyn was epic, of course. Only reason why I didn't gave it a 10 was no "Only Cat" in the final scene. I was really looking forward to hearing LF utter that line.
Â 
All in all, a 9 for me.
246	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-05-20	6
Â 
first ep I have no desire to re-watch. Easily the worst of the season
247	GSP	2014-05-20	Gave it a seven.
Â 
For reasons I can't quite put my finger on, the episode just didn't do too much for me.
Â 
Viper/Tyrion scene was solid, but probably underwhelming in effect having been book spoiled.
248	Inevittable	2014-05-20	Have given this one a 7, which I feel like I've given to a lot of episodes lately. Â 
Â 
Sansa and Robert/Robin's scenes aren't quite what I'd hoped, though I was very glad to see the Winterfell snow castle made it to the TV screen.
Â 
I spent most of Littlefinger's scenes laughing at Aiden's fluctuating accent so I couldn't take him seriously, but Sophie did a great job in the scene by the moon door.
Â 
Loved seeing Hot Pie, and I was glad that he actually mentioned having seen Arya. Â I've got so used to all the 'so close yet so far' storylines that it was nicely refreshing.
Â 
But the scene between Tyrion and Oberyn stole it for me. Â Even though I knew how it was going to end I was resisting the urge to get up and hug the TV when Oberyn said.... "I will be your champion." Â Bless.
Â 
ETA - I also quite enjoyed Dany and Daario's scene. Â He had some swagger, but then so did she. Â Seems strange that they didn't show them actually getting it on, which is either because they didn't, or because the producers got all coy about showing a woman in charge of the sexy times.

249	rmholt	2014-05-20	So at least LF accent has thrown the hounds off of Tyrions which remains 1] awful and 2] variable.
250	Ran	2014-05-20	539 votes, 8.30 rating, 9 median, 8.42 normalized average (top 5% and bottom 5% removed).
251	TheonsPhantomCock	2014-05-20	....Only Cat" vs "Your sister"? Is it that big of an issue?


Â 
I imagine they had to make it clear for the Unsullied. Catelyn died 8 episodes ago? The look on her face was brilliantly done. It was perfectly delivered by both of them, although I have noticed LF seems to talk out the side of his mouth, which is a little off putting.Â 
Â 
Didn't particularly like the Snow Castle scene. It was OK.
Â 
Good bits:
1. Tyrion/Oberyn was brilliant. The building emotion on T's face when O is speaking and the way O picks up the torch so his face is lit up when he says "I'll be your champion". Good stuff. Great direction. That single section said a lot about Oberyn, Tyrion, Jamie and Cersei.
2. Liked Bronn explaining his rationale to Tyrion, but obviously feeling bad about it
3. The NW scene was well done.
4. The looks between Tyrion and Jamie, discussing how awkward it would be for Tywin if Jamie said he'd be Tyrion's champion.
5. Pod, Pie and Brienne. Great scene. Loved the interplay now between Pod and Brienne. It works really well. Loved the looks they had when HotPie sat down and started talking about gravy, etc.
Â 
Sticking points:
When did Arya become Aya?
Mountain 3 is stupidly big and I was sitting there thinking he was going to be given only 1-2 lines....and sure enough. And yes, that whole scene was ridiculous. We know from previous series that he's a monster. We've already heard about the Hound being shoved in the fire, him raping and pillaging (remember the guy with the bag of fish) and he chopped the head off a frigging horse!
252	jons nissa	2014-05-20	I suspect arya may actually give the Hound "the gift" in the show version and there will be no future gravedigger..... He made a point of showing her where the heart is


Â 
i got that feeling as well. very curious about it......
253	Zachary Snow	2014-05-20	Pedro Pascal has another great turn as Oberyn and although he didn't have much screen time he was my favorite part. Â I liked most of it i just still can't get by new Daario, i hate him. Â i will give it a 9
254	Goldfinger	2014-05-21	Littlefinger could say to Lysa:
â<U+0080><U+009C>Chaos isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never try again. The fall breaks them.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
9
255	The Killer Snark	2014-05-21	I think this episode has easily been the highest rated of the season, deservedly. It shows how schizophrenic, however, the show is actually becoming. A contender for the finest episode ever following perhaps the show's worst.
256	Lothar	2014-05-21	I gave it a 7. Â The three Tyrion scenes were all excellent, but those were the only scenes I'd really ever care to see again. Â As I said before I'm upset that they rushed through the Sansa scene, only give it a few minutes, and skipped over my favorite Sansa part in the series - the actual building of the Winterfell castle - so important and emotional to show how she misses Winterfell and such a contrast to how she wanted to leave it in the beginning of the series. Â I really wish the Vale stuff had been given as much time and care as the trial last week. Â 
Â 
Other than that, the rest of the show felt like a lot of filler honestly. Â The Dany scenes were boring. Â Why not show the inside of Meereen, show some of people getting killed in the streets? Â Or.. why not show Jorah making a move on Dany and kissing her like in the book. Â I suppose they could still do it her remaining two episodes but they also have to have Jorah's betrayal, a dragon eating a kid, and the chaining of the dragons. Â There's so much they can do. Â I don't know why has her story has been so dull.
Â 
Jon's scene was bland and could have been left out. Â Still there's not much tension or panic. Â Jesus, 100,000 people are about to attack. Â The way they're talking, you would think 30-50 were about to attack. Â I've seen on other forums lots of people who haven't read the books don't even realize the battle is about to happen. Â Why would they really. Â Mance has been coming for 2 seasons.
Â 
I just don't care about the Milsandre/Selyse scene and Pod/Brienne. Â I feel like the show needs more focus. Â Last episode was great with a large portion focused on Tyrion. Â This time put a lot of focus on another big story. Â This just feels so tangential and makes the show come off as if nothing happened until the final 10 minutes. Â It's been a problem in a few episodes this season.
Â 
The less said about the re-introduction of the Mountain the better.
Â 
Arya and the Hound was okay. Â Dialogue could have been better. Â The way they used Rorge and Biter was pretty damn weak. Â If there was a big fight instead, it could have actually maybe turned into something compelling. Â Like the House and Arya's scene in the first episode. Â That was fantastic. Â

I so LOL'd on the demise of Biter and Rorge. I think if rampaging outlaws are needed for future episodes, such as Brienne's doomed stand at the Crossbow Inn, it wouldn't be contrary to the book to find more monsters. Westeros is full of them.
258	JagLover	2014-05-21	If they nail the next 3 episodes then this could be the best season so far.
Â 
In terms of this episode only an 8 (though parts of it were aÂ solid 10/10).
Â 
I am finding Mereen as dull on the screen as in the books, so that knocks down the score a little. I also thought the scenes at the Eyrie were a little rushed and yes the confrontation with Rorge and Biter was a little off. Dragonstone scenes seemed pointless as well.
Â 
Other than that though all pure Gold.
Â 
Tyrion, Bronn
Tyrion Oberyn
The Hound and Arya Â 
Â 
all spot on.
259	The Faceless One	2014-05-21	I gave it 10. Â Mainly because the acting was by far the best of the season and possibly the best of all 4 seasons thus far. Â Up to this point, most of the season has been owned, acting wise, by Charles Dance. Â He's been amazing and deserving of acclaim and awards.
Â 
The scene with Oberyn and Tyrion was superb and intense. Â I don't put much stock in the Emmys but Dinklage earned himself another with that scene alone. Â He didn't say much but the emotions and expressions were fantastic especially when Oberyn talked of how Cersei pinched his pecker and talked of how he killed her mother. Â The scenes with Bronn and Jaime were pretty good, too. Â  Pascal has actually been a pleasant surprise despite the lack of the colorful beard, but I could have really done without them making him into a bisexual freak. Â Completely unnecessary.
Â 
I also loved the scene with Arya and Rorge while liking the scene with Arya and the Hound when the hound talked about his brother and father.
Â 
"He on your little list?"
Â 
"Can't be. Â I don't know his name."
Â 
"What's your name?"
Â 
"Rorge."
Â 
"Thank you."---Needle to the heart.
Â 
The gratuitous nudity at Dragonstone and the contrived scene with Daario in Mereen should have knocked it down to an 8 or 9, but I liked the other scenes way too much. Â I did like how Melissandre admitted that much of her "magic" is fake.
260	Ran	2014-05-21	Â  Pascal has actually been a pleasant surprise despite the lack of the colorful beard
Â 
You're thinking Daario. Oberyn has no beard.

262	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-21	I gave it a 7 initially and after re-watching, I'm sticking with my 7. Â The Tyrion scenes and the Eyrie scenes were excellent and well-done. I was a bit jarred initially from not hearing "Only Cat", but the scene works really well. I wish it were longer. They could have cut-out that pointless Melissandre scene and added more at the Eyrie. The actress who plays Lysa is amazing.
Â 
This episode could have easily been a 9 or 10 had it not been for the Melissandre and Dany stuff. I'm officially bored with Dany's story and her characterization. I'm not buying this new Daario at all and don't think he and Emilia have any chemistry and I'm guessing that's the reason we didn't see them actually having sex, since we know how much this show loves a sex scene or maybe it only likes non-consensual or prostitute sex scenes. Who knows?Â 
Â 
I'm always happy to see Jon, but that scene really served no purpose except to inform us how much the men at the Night's Watch (or those in charge) really suck and we already know that. Â I did enjoy Brienne and Pod's scenes and loved seeing Hot Pie again.
Â 
Peter Dinklage killed it this episode. I do think he's on his way to another Emmy and deservedly so. I'm also incredibly impressed by Pedro Pascal. The scene between those two was incredibly moving. If I were judging on Tyrion and Eyrie scenes alone, the episode would be a 10. Melissandre & Dany dragged it down to a 7 for me.

I remember having read somewhere that one actress was refusing to do any more nude/sex scenes in the show. Maybe it was Emilia Clarke, and this would explain why Dany-Daario happened offscreen.
Â 
It certainly wasn't Carice van Houten, that's for sure. Though the way they cut immediately from Dany-Daario to Melisandre's bathtub scene seemed to me as if this was supposed to make up for missing on the hot sex scene or something. That was done in very poor taste, IMO.

This was a great and well-paced follow-up to the previous episode. The last two scenes were just terrific (Pedro Pascal and Peter Dinklage in that scene and Aidan Gillen). I expect three mind-blowing episodes will end this season. Alik Sakharov did very well this year and I also liked those few mentions and references to the characters in the books which are not so important.

Â 
That could be true, but you can do a sex scene and have her covered. Her sexiest love scene was when she was married to Khal Drogo and Emilia Clarke was fully clothed. So I'm not completely buying that they didn't do the scene due to that reason. I can't help but think that it's moreso that EC and whatever his name is that's playing Daario couldn't sell it. I just think a love scene of those two would be really awkward. At the least, they could have shown them kissing. but they didn't. Why? Â Either they couldn't sell it or they don't like consensual sex scenes on this show.

I don't understand why the show is so adamant about showing sex in such negative scenarios almost exclusively. Really, the only really nice sex scene was Ygritte/Jon and that one time with Dany/Drogo. But they sure love all the rape and prostitute sex scenes. And speaking of Dany/Drogo, they even made that first one into a rape. Ugg.Â

266	Dragon Queen	2014-05-21	8. Previous ratings 9, 10, 9, 8, 7, 7. Awesome start to the season but it's been slower ever since. 
+Tyrion meeting with Bronn, Jaime, and Oberyn. Great dialogue and interaction. Those 4 have been in my opinion some of the most interesting characters to watch this season. 
+Mountain being so big. Can't believe he's 6'9''!!
+Dany's outfit
+I was very glad to see that they kept the snow castle scene. That chapter in the books was one of my favorites in the series, it was very moving. 
- Few show watchers had any idea who the Mountain was. 
- Dragonstone scene.

The snow castle: I liked the length in the book. Â It was cut pretty short in the show. Â Robin was portrayed as less of a jerk than in the book - either way his behavior is his mom's fault and I include the shaking sickness since it behaves exactly like pseudoseizures.
Â 
The Mountain: This begs the question for non readers: So what? They'll find out and wont suffer from the waiting. Often I find myself watching a show that is not based on a book and I have to wait several episodes to get some questions answered. I think that adds to the show.
268	The Ghost of Rhaegar	2014-05-21	9/10.
Â 
i enjoyed this episode a lot. Â the scenes with tyrion and sansa were the best. Â they made an awesome show.

269	7th-key	2014-05-21	I gave it an 8, lots of solid parts and without storytelling atrocities.
Â 
Wall: shouldn't they be in a frenzy, rushing at planning and building their defences? I don't feel the urgency: 100'000 Wildlings are coming. Ok they discussed boringly about the tunnel, but they didn't even start strategy for the Wildlings already on the south side....
Vale: Rushed. Only two episodes and Lysa is gone.
The Vale looks empty.
Brienne: I found it annoying that Pod makes a reasonable point about keeping the mission a bit undercover in such a shifty territory as Westeros, but TPTB turns Brienne's faux-pas in a victory, so she can be all smug with Pod.
I don't care much about Hot Pie but I admit it was nice to see him in the scene.
Dany: That was a curious if not interesting approach with Daario, despite the lack of chemistry. I'm extremely irked that, again, the show doesn't bother to portray sex and nudity where it's plot relevant.
I might be alone in my sentiment: I'm no fan of Ser KnowsItAll (aka Lord Friendzone).
Shallow me:Â  Khaleesie's belly button!
Tyrion/Jaime, Tyrion/Bronn: loved it, plus the scenes showed how Tyrion expected other people to sacrifice themselves for him. Bronn asking when did Tyrion put his life on the line for Bronn was perfect.
Oberyn rocks, Pedro is excellent. But IÂ  wished Tyrion hadn't gone misty eyed when Oberyn told about the visit at Casterly Rock, but angry and resentful (at Cersei) instead.
I guess I had enough of Tyrion being too emotional with Shae on the show.
Arya / Hound: same old same old...
Mountain: he's a teddy bear!
Last: I'm bummed by sloppiness of the credits. I don't get it, did they lose the Dragonstone and Eyrie files? They're already designed an programmed. Or does the company charge double for rendering now?

Â 
Wall: It seems like they don't believe Jon in regards to the scale of the attack. Janos was openly skeptical a couple of eps ago and the First Builder seemed skeptical this episode. And we know ol' Alliser is skeptical as heck. They seem still to suspect Jon might be working for the wildlings.
Â 
Dany: Agree on the lack of chemistry. S3 Daario may not have been the greatest actor, but at least he had presence. S4 Daario is very bland. Having said that I agree eith you that since they show female full frontals on the show it's lame that they don't show male full frontals. This is HBO ffs, not Nickelodeon.
Â 
Tyrion: Ooooooh, there was anger and resentment in Tyrion's eyes at that moment. Those weren't tears of mistiness my friend, those were tears of fury.
271	Dormund of Ruddy Hall	2014-05-21	The scene with Oberyn was pure magic, the scene with Jaime was serviceable, the scene with Bronn was wonderfully adapted from the book to be in line with the more likeable Bronn of the TV show, and the scene at the Vale checked all the boxes, and the snow castle scene looked as beautiful as I imagined it.Â  A bit more lingering in that moment wouldn't have hurt, but I thought it was fine.Â  The only slight nitpick was the youthfulness of the new Mountain.Â  They should have used more makeup and perhaps a wig to make him look older and more monstrous.Â  But that is a nitpick.Â  Great episode.Â  Show Oberyn is younger than book Oberyn, too, but the actor is so good that I don't remotely care.
272	ground_control	2014-05-21	Dany: That was a curious if not interesting approach with Daario, despite the lack of chemistry. I'm extremely irked that, again, the show doesn't bother to portray sex and nudity where it's plot relevant.


I liked the lack of [female] nudity in that scene (and we saw as much of Daario as we did Mel -- T&A, no full frontal). Â I agree that S4 Daario is way different than Book/S3 Daario. Â Book Daario is very much in control during sex, in S4, Dany is in control. Â Dany remaining clothed while having Daario strip down to his collar shows that (in the books, when she tells Daario to strip, he tells her she has to as well). Â Note that Dany is already fully dressed (in different clothes) when Daario leaves, but he's still rushing to put his clothes back on.
273	Davrum	2014-05-21	... and we saw as much of Daario as we did Mel -- T&A, no full frontal) ...


Â 
Come on, we've seen much more full frontal of ladies in the show than men, and this would have been the perfect opportunity to balance the ledger. It only made it worse that we lingered significantly longer on naked Mel than we did naked Daario. And let's not even pretend for a second that male T is equivalent to female T. The male gaze to female gaze ratio in this ep was as imbalanced as ever. Admittedly I haven't timed it all out with a stopwatch (yet) but that was how it played to me. I will at least give it that Mel's nudity wasn't the dumb sexposition of earlier seasons, it made sense in context - that she was displaying her power fearlessly to Selyse by refusing to be vulnerable even as she was physically exposed.
Â 
It was great to see Dany be clearly the alpha in the dynamic with Daario, but on the downside the S4 version of Daario is much less of a natural alpha than S3 Daario was, so the tension of that dynamic wasn't as fun as it would have been if it had been Ed Skrein she was bossing. And I say that as someone who wasn't particularly a fan of Ed Skrein last year too. It's only now I've gotten to know the new Daario I've begun to think Skrein wasn't so bad after all.

1) Â I don't agree that male T and female T aren't "equal", and a lot of people don't, so I'm not pretending anything. Â Unfortunately, many tv/movie producers take advantage of the fact that many people do consider male and female T to be unequal, so when creating works that are allowed to show female T go out of their way to do so.
Â 
2) From a technical perspective, full frontal male nudity is (for obvious reasons) harder to film for television than full frontal female nudity, so I would prefer no/less male frontal nudity on the grounds that it would take resources that could be better used for other scenes. Â That said, I don't really *want* any full frontal female nudity, but again, there are times when it takes more effort to avoid than it's worth. Â I don't want the show to waste anytime figuring out how to add more of either.
Â 
BTW, I agree that S3 Daario was Book Daario in ways S4 Daario never could be, so I guess it's better that they didn't try. Â To be honest, I hate Book Daario so much that I am actually amused by how much they have emasculated him.
277	The Killer Snark	2014-05-22	I actually thought the Dany and Daario scene was sexy as hell. They needed to show Dany's gaze travelling down his body to show the subtle change in her arousal as her gaze travels to his crotch. It's a less is more type of thing. If the camera had then travelled to the front and homed in, close-up, on his schlong, I think the scene may have lost its erotic subtlety somehow.
Â 
But the nudity ratio between males and females should be equalled, I agree. This is a problem with you guys, though, from the US. In the UK, equal male and female nudity in film and television tends to be the norm. It's not Political Correctness in the UK, so much as a filmic squeamishness about male nudity that's always existed in the States. However, there hasn't been a lot of nudity of any variety this season and I'm hoping that may change.

1) I used to tell myself the same thing, and I wish it was true, but in the end I had to admit to myself it just didn't wash. I'll just assume you're from Bordeaux and take your word for it  .
Â 
2) It is technically more challenging, but really not significantly so.

279	The Killer Snark	2014-05-22	Davrum - I appreciate that point. I art modelled once and it was...ahem, very difficult with atractive women drawing me to keep my ahem...attention on being immobile. I'd imagine male actors probably have the same problem, or if they get filmed flaccid there's the opposite problem of them being worried if they're big enough and then having to excuse themselves by saying it was very cold in the studio that day.
Â 
It really should be equal, though, just so the nudity in the show isn't catering more or less just to the men.

1) Not from Bordeaux, just the boring USA. Â I'm not saying I like or want general public nudity -- far from it, in fact. Â But not because I'm a prude, just because I don't really want to see want to see that much of most people I meet. Â The % of attractive people in tv shows is much different than the % of attractive people in real life. Â Also, body odor not a big plus for me.
Â 
To be honest, I do think that there are fewer situations for bare female T than bare male T, but for practical reasons -- I'm assuming there's a reason why there are sports bras in addition to regular bras and bikini tops. Â Also, notice that the cup size of female actors chosen to do nude scenes doesn't seem to reflect the general population. Â While in the long run *more* ubiquitous female T on tv would likely correct for that, I don't see an industry which cancels shows mid-season and doesn't like to renew more than a year at a time as one that makes long term investments.
Â 
2) I'm not interested in getting as graphical as necessary to debate the technical issues, but you're so wrong it isn't funny. Â As far as equality goes, I don't want equality, I want quality. Â The answer to gratuitous beaver shots is not "just add sausage".

I thought it made it more funny! That character is such a goofball. Â I bet Brienne appreciates the much more laconic Pod a bit more.
284	Count Balerion	2014-05-22	Episode 7: I initially voted 9, but upon reflection took it down to 8; perhaps it should be 8.5.Â  All the
scenes with Tyrion were excellent, not only because of PD, but also thanks to NCW, PP, and the chap who
plays Bronn.Â  Sansa was also excellent, and the scenery looked lovely as well.Â  It did seem a tad short, and
I missed certain things from the book.Â  I think Robin was handled decently, at first trying to help Sansa,
then accidentally messing up, then throwing a temper tantrum and smashing the castle.Â  Some of the
changes seemed harmless, but also unnecessary.Â  Of the other segments, the only ones I disliked were
Mountain, Daenerys/Daario, and Mel; at least these were mercifully short, though.Â  Nice to see Ser Jorah
allowed to do something. Brienne was pretty good, but I wondered why she couldn't figure out for herself
that asking after Sansa by name might not be the best idea.

Â 
1) It's a little ironic that you think there are fewer situations for bare female T than bare male T for practical reasons when GoT has shown so much more of the former. I don't know if we're going to see eye to eye on this, but the show's imbalance in terms of male gaze vs female gaze is stark.
Â 
Also, I've noticed GoT has displayed cup sizes of all shapes and ... sizes. Not every bare-chested girl we've seen on the show would need our modern bra technology when it came time to cover up again. Also notice HBO's continually successful Girls, which makes a point of having larger girls exposed. HBO may not be doing it 100% right with their shows, but fair credit to them, they could definitely be doing worse.
Â 
2) No, Kristian Nairn has described the "technical issues" graphically enough for the both of us. You're right of course that the answer to gratuitous beaver shots is not "just add sausage". It's "just add a hollow sausage sewn onto a thong". It is, like I said, not a big deal at all for skilled filmmakers. We're talking about 1% of 1% of 1% of 1% of 1% of 1% of 1% of the budget here. It's almost less than nothing. Its effect on the quality of the overall production (assuming we, for some weird reason, ignore the fact that equality is one of the greatest qualities of all) is so small it's not worth remarking on. I'm so right it's hilarious.

1) I was talking about real life -- you were discussing where I live, so I was responding with my opinion about real-world nudity. Â As far as the show goes, I think HBO goes overboard with both male and female T (not sure why the Mountain or Ramsay had to be topless in their last scenes, for example).
Â 
1a) I was commenting about tv nudity in general, not saying HBO/GOT is specifically bad, Â But to be honest, I can't think of any flat chested females in GOT, so I'm not sure what you mean by "all cup sizes".
Â 
2) I have no clue what you are talking about re:Kristian Nairn (all I know is that he's a gay DJ that plays Hodor). Â If you don't understand how men and women are different "down below", and that there are different rules about what can be shown in order for a show to get a specific rating, that's all you -- as I said, I'm not going to get technical here. Â But GOT is not a porno, so there are most definitely more restrictions on full frontal male nudity than full frontal female nudity, and (since GOT isn't a porno) it's really not worth spending the time/money to shove sausage in people's faces. Â IMO, if there's an "equality issue", I'm ok with NO crotch shots, male or female.
287	FalseKnight	2014-05-22	Jorah saved that scene with Dany, I agree.
Â 
Â 
I don't know what's up with Dany, her acting imo has gotten noticably worse since getting to Meereen.
Â 
It's like Emilia has read the books and knows she is supposed to get more unlikable? lol

This and I'm surprised it took this long.
288	FalseKnight	2014-05-22	Â 
That could be true, but you can do a sex scene and have her covered. Her sexiest love scene was when she was married to Khal Drogo and Emilia Clarke was fully clothed. So I'm not completely buying that they didn't do the scene due to that reason. I can't help but think that it's moreso that EC and whatever his name is that's playing Daario couldn't sell it. I just think a love scene of those two would be really awkward. At the least, they could have shown them kissing. but they didn't. Why? Â Either they couldn't sell it or they don't like consensual sex scenes on this show.
Â 
I don't understand why the show is so adamant about showing sex in such negative scenarios almost exclusively. Really, the only really nice sex scene was Ygritte/Jon and that one time with Dany/Drogo. But they sure love all the rape and prostitute sex scenes. And speaking of Dany/Drogo, they even made that first one into a rape. Ugg.Â 

Did you miss Robb and Talisa?
289	The Anti-Targ	2014-05-23	Great episode. Getting bored with the Dany plotline, much as I did with the books. Clearly they'll be needing to bring some TWoW story into the next season, or they'll have to make stuff up to tread water until S6.

Â 
1) No, I know , when I said it was ironic I didn't mean you were contradicting yourself, just that it was ironic. In real life, just as in medieval times I guess, we're much more likely to see bare manchest, whereas in GoT we're much more likely to see ladychest.
Â 
1a) It's understandable if you can't remember every ladychest GoT has displayed, since there have been about three thousand of them and that's a lot of them to remember, but one that springs immediately to mind is in the scene in which we first meet Pedro Pascal's Oberyn, casting his eye over a few of Baelish's girls. The first girl he undresses for her full fontal (the one Ellaria rejects as too timid) is barely even an A-cup.
Â 
2) Wait ... men and women are different "down below"? 
Â 
Actually I brought up Kristian Nairn because there's a video of him online describing the exact "technical issue" you seemed to be eluding to. Now I realise when you said "technical issue" you really meant "regulatory issue". But no, as far as I know there are no "different rules about what can be shown in order for a show to get a specific rating". This is HBO. HBO is premium cable and is not regulated by the FCC. They can do what they want. They can show sausage in GoT if they want. The proof of that is that they have indeed shown sausage in GoT more than once. If these mysterious "different rules" you speak of actually exist then how has GoT already shown full frontal male nudity more than once?
291	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-23	^Pretty sure we have seen both Theon and Olyvar (The Oberyn Orgy scene) full frontal, however briefly
292	7th-key	2014-05-23	I got the impression, from some DVD/nside the ep/whatever commentaries, that CGI or/and prosthetics are used for the crotches of either sexes.Â Â 
Â 
Anyway, I found Season 1 to be the most homogeneous. For example Tyrion (with prostitutes) and Jaime (with Cersei)Â  showed at least some hint of legs. Then you had Robb, Theon and Jon bare chested getting groomed. Theon was fully naked with Roz and the ship woman, but I think they showed theÂ  appendage only with the former. Hodor in the woods - not exactly an eye candy, but bizarre and at the same time natural . Of curse Drogo's backside made up for that.
Â 
Then it felt like the show fell more and more into scenes with men topless at best and women stripping down to all levels (and positions). First wtf instance: dressed-up-to-coat Stannis with totally-naked Melisandre.
293	The Killer Snark	2014-05-23	I hate the use of prosthetics in nude scenes. It is totally disingenuous, and cheating. People should either be nude or not, or there's no draw to it. Wearing a merkin to cover your pudenda or a giant fake penis as self-flattery, as an actor or actress, is not daring. It's only nudity, people; it can be a beautiful thing. I admire Scarlett Johansson for going fully and naturally nude in Under the Skin. She looked fantastic. I don't think the female actresses in GoT are wearing merkins, though. I suspect some of the actresses did this in Spartacus, which also used prosthetic schlongs.

295	Ran	2014-05-23	It's the double standard that there's something more shocking in showing the vulva than there is in the (unerect) penis (first season featured non-prosthetic male genitals). Hence merkins on the ladies.
Â 
I recall an interview with Steven DeKnight with several of the actors -- male and female -- and they were asked something about Roman grooming, and so DeKnight explained how the evidence suggests Romans depilated, so the male actors who had nude scenes shaved... and then the ladies asked, well, wait, why do we have to wear these huge merkins? And DeKnight said something along the lines of it being "another conversation entirely".

GoT certainly has gone almost entirely without merkins, for whatever reasons that may be.
296	ground_control	2014-05-23	1a) It's understandable if you can't remember every ladychest GoT has displayed, since there have been about three thousand of them and that's a lot of them to remember, but one that springs immediately to mind is in the scene in which we first meet Pedro Pascal's Oberyn, casting his eye over a few of Baelish's girls. The first girl he undresses for her full fontal (the one Ellaria rejects as too timid) is barely even an A-cup.
Â 
2) Wait ... men and women are different "down below"? 
Â 
Actually I brought up Kristian Nairn because there's a video of him online describing the exact "technical issue" you seemed to be eluding to. Now I realise when you said "technical issue" you really meant "regulatory issue". But no, as far as I know there are no "different rules about what can be shown in order for a show to get a specific rating". This is HBO. HBO is premium cable and is not regulated by the FCC. They can do what they want. They can show sausage in GoT if they want. The proof of that is that they have indeed shown sausage in GoT more than once. If these mysterious "different rules" you speak of actually exist then how has GoT already shown full frontal male nudity more than once?


1a) I checked out that scene, good catch. Â And as I said, I wasn't criticizing HBO or GOT specifically, I was just thinking out loud that there are non-prudish reasons to be concerned with how nudity is handled.
Â 
2) Yeah, I can be a bit snarky at times  Â FYI, I know that HBO has included full frontal male nudity before. Â You are correct, one of my concerns is that the costs of regulatory compliance would outweigh the benefits. Â FYI, the FCC most definitely does regulate cable tv. Â A lot of the regulations are different than for over-the-air broadcasts, but one thing that cable (premium or otherwise) shares with "regular" tv is the ratings system. Â My understanding is that the TV-MA (what GOT is) is like an MPAA (movie) 'R' rating, which is more restrictive than the MPAA NC-17 rating (which replaced the older 'X' designation for porn).
Â 
Anyway, my point wasn't that HBO isn't allowed to show certain things, just that the cost to add them is greater than zero, which is (at most) the value I receive from full frontal male or female nudity in GOT. Â So as long as you can admit that the cost is greater than zero (which you did seem to earlier), there's probably no point arguing what that cost is, we're just two viewers disagreeing about how important something is to a scene.
Â 
BTW, if you have a link to the Nairn video, I'd be interested to hear what he has to say on the matter -- I googled and saw several various clips from him, but if there was one where he goes into detail, I'd like to check it out.

Â 
Because I would guess the women wear panties and the the rest is added in post production retouching. Perfectly discrete pubic mounds. Looked quite like it, for example in the "Blackwater" Tavern scene with Bronn.

Â 
I don't find the purpose of nudity to display the actor/actress' assets but to make a scene more organic. In a rational world nudity shouldn't be a issue - besides, if it's a natural thing it shouldn'tÂ  be that daring for the actors.
Â 
Going natural is surely sensible for independent or realistic films, where already one can see actors with a common or simpler level of attractiveness.
Â 
In regard to GoT, in an era where every frame is passed through some kind of SFX/retouching, where there's costuming , wigging, hours of make up, etc,Â  demanding the genuineness of the actors/actresses' private junks is unnecessary.

That they shot all day and at the start she used a robe between takes, but since the set was warm, she just discared the robe for the rest of the day.She actually has a number of interviews about both sex and nudity on the show and how she does not give it a second thought... ah the enlightened Dutch!

303	Ran	2014-05-24	That's the HBO.com interview she did (here):
Â 
I wore a modesty patch and Joe did too. I come from Holland, and there's a lot of nudity in film there. We're very used to it. That doesn't mean that nude scenes are my favorite to do-not at all. But I'm not uncomfortable. I also believe that on set, the more you change into a robe or the more timid you are, the more people will want to see you. At the end of that day, I was basically walking around naked the whole time. That took away the sex and the tension. I pick up on other people's discomfort. I'd rather than have people be bored with my naked body. But again, it's not my favorite thing in the world. I had less trouble with it when I was younger.
Â 
So... not her favorite thing, but she found the performance easier if everyone on set was just used to her body -- no discomfort from them, no discomfort for her, I guess.

You mentioned, however, your support for more male nudity. Well, someone asked me, and I was like, â<U+0080><U+009C>Of course. Why not?â<U+0080><U+009D> I know sex sells and people watch it because itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s new, but it also makes the show more real. If it becomes sexist, then itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s wrong, but I think so far it hasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t been. I would never take my clothes off if I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think it was appropriate for the scene.Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not something that I would like to do. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not my favorite thing in the world, at all. It may have something to do with the fact that Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m from Holland. I did a film eight years ago with Paul Verhoeven. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a signature in his work. Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s where I come from, so I have a different approach than most Americans. Who sleeps with their bra on?

305	The Faithless Man	2014-05-24	a solid 8 for me. Â Oberyn & Tyrion scenes were just superb. Â The Mountain scenes were just "yeah - we already know he's a brutal killer and...the point of the scenes were what exactly? Just re-introducing the character - OK, but a little more subtlety please - less is more 
Dany's scenes were just disconnected for me. Â I love the interaction between the Brienne & Pod actors - it is great! Â I rather like the complex interaction between Arya and the Hound, I think it brings out and establishes both Sandor's frailty and Arya's increasing ruthlessness. Â Jon/wall scenes were a clear set up for the big attack. Â Thought the Messilander scene a bit odd. Â EyrieÂ scene was great.
Overall an episode that was not so tightly woven for me, but saved by some outstanding scenes/performances by Dinklage and Pascal
306	Lord Spark of House Spark	2014-05-25	First the Gripes...
I liked the scene with Arya and the hound with the old man. But it was spoiled by the pathetic ending of it with Rorge and Biter. These two were of the three most dangerous prisoners in Kings Landing. According to an SSM they set up an illegal fighting pit with Biter as the main attraction. Biter has a ton of experience of fighting and killing in brawl type of fights, I really cant believe he had his neck snapped that easily. Why would Rorge just stand there, after that, with his sword dangling by his side; they knew how dangerous the hound wasÂ even if he wasn't expecting Arya to stab him like that, it didn't happen very fast, so why did he make no attempt to protect himself.Â 
I appreciate that they needed to give the Hound his injury, and I can see how the bite would get him back to where he and Arya parted company in the books, but the whole fight was incredibly poorly scripted and choreographed, far below quality for the show.
Â 
It was, however,Â made to look like a work of genius compared to the season introduction of the Mountain who Rides. Perhaps Oberyn could dress as Popeye the sailor man and eat some spinach before the fight. It was always the best way to defeat Bluto in the old cartoons.
Â 
I agree with previous posters about the lack of chemistry between Dany and Daario, Jon at the wal seemed entirely filler, as if he has a minimum screen time per episode clause in his contract.
Mel's nude scene was not necessary to further the plot in any way. She looked fabulous, but it was completely gratuitous.
Â 
I think the snow castle scene was handled really well. yes they could have dragged it out a bit more, showing Sansa's frustration at not getting it quite right. But Sophie would have to be an expert ice carver to make it convincing.
Aiden Gillen finally got the chance to show what a great actor he is. the kiss was just great, perfectly creepy, and Sophie Turner portrayed it so that you could not really tell if she welcomed it or not. if GRRM doesn't get WOW out before season 5 starts we will be deep into spoiler territory next year with Sansa.
The Moon door scene could have benefitted from being a bit longer, closer to the books, withÂ the explaination of how Hoster had nearly killed her with theÂ moon tea. It would have gone some way to explaining to the unsullied how she got to be so crazy, and given a bit more sympathy at the Only Cat moment.Â I didn't mind it being changed to "your sister". I never realised it was an Iconic line until I read this forum.
Â 
All of Tyrion's scenes were great
8 1/2 out of ten, highest mark so far for me

Â 
Didn't like Dany/Daario scene (too rushed) or the first Hound/Arya scene (aren't Biter/Rorge supposed to turn up later?).
Â 
Eyrie chapter was my favourite in the books, on TV not bad but it felt a bit short/rushed.

316	Damazama21	2014-06-07	The episode felt really smooth, and everything flowed perfectly. There wasn't a huge amount of action, but I thought it was beautifully acted, and the final scene was amazing. 10/10

The thing about it is non of my friends are really into this show. I have tried to get them hooked on it but they don't wanna give it a chance. It's a double edged sword. I want to talk about and get more insight into the show but everywhere I look someone spoils something, even inadvertently. I only check the non-spoiler threads and the episode review threads but even those sometimes get spoiled by someone saying what's going to happen next episode. I had the "only cat" spoiled already because someone mentioned it way back in that episode thread what happened in the books. It kills me but at the same time I really like discussing this show, I just can't do it with any of my friends.

It was her that got all bent out of shape when Robin accidentally knocked the tower over, and it seemed like Robin's initial response was just to defend himself. They both behaved like rotten children, but really I felt that Sansa came across as the more unreasonable one.

Â 
i only look at the topics that don't contain spoilers, although as much as you read you a bound to skim over spoilers, and i have had a few minor things ruined in the past, but as of right now, the only thing that has been spoiled has to do with someone mentioned what might or might not have been the outcome in the next episode regarding the trial by combat.
Â 
I enjoy discussion about the show with fellow non book readers, and enjoy reading other peoples theory's and how they allign with my own. I only have 1 workmate who watches the show, my wife isn't interested in it, none of my friends are into "my nerd sci fi shows" So in the real world there is only 1 person who i can discuss it with. Actually i Lie, i had my mother over, and she sat down and was watching an episode with me, (a little awkward during the sex and rape scenes) however she was hooked, and as of last week i gave her season 1 and 2 on DVD. She told me over the phone she had finished season 1 and was half way though season 2, so it will be interested next time i see her what she thinks will happen in the future.
Â 
As for the episode, i had read awhile ago that Lysa had been killed, but not by who, so that was nice to finally see it. I predicted that Bron would not fight for Tyrion, and that Oberyn would, it was nice to see that unfold.
I really really didn't like how they introduced the mountain in the episode, the blood splatter and gore/ slaughter was over the top, not that its a bad thing, but to me it was so over the top it seemed comical, and i couldn't take the scene seriously.
Â 
I am really interested to see where Sansa goes from here, and love the bond building between Arya and The hound, im hoping she removes him from her list.......
333	XTwipz	2014-05-20	This episode shocked me. First, I though it was just "another" episode with just the usual story. But some parts were amazing. First, the moment with Bronn and Tyrion, I was about to cry. Then Oberyn came and tell to Tyrion "I will be your champion". I begin to like Oberyn. I really would like he kills the mountain. Then at the end, that part with Sansa, Littlefinger and Lysa. When he said "your sister", I was like "no he can't push her back.... "And he did it. Amazing week episode. But we have to wait 2 weeks before the next one... ****
334	missingm	2014-05-22	As a non-book reader I really like how the shows are put together this year. It seems like the writing and direction are really hitting their stride. It must be incredibly difficult to handle so many story lines. I especially like the time they are giving to Tyrion in the last few episodes and I really enjoy the Arya Hound interactions.Â
335	AryaSansa	2014-05-22	I liked this episode a lot.
Â 
The ending was great.Â  LittleFinger is just an amazing character!Â  I was totally caught by surprise when he pushed her out of moondoor.Â Â  However, I hated Sansa - she was so mean to Robin.Â  She told him he "ruined" her castle when he accidentally knocked a tower down.Â Â  Also, it seems Sansa is/was much bigger than Lysa, so she was in no real danger of getting thrown out the door.Â  The thing I'm left wondering is how LittleFinger is going to explain how Lysa died - it's either Sansa or LF that did it... maybe LF will say she was suicidal?Â  Maybe Robin ordered her to fly?Â  Or maybe the first person that comes in will take the blame?
Â 
I liked the Oberyn scene and the Bronn scene.Â Â  I hope Oberyn dies though, aside from that scene, all he does is have sex.Â  But that would mean Tyrion dies too, unless Tywin pardons him, or he escapes.
Â 
Liked the Arya scene, except the wound seemed so superficial - why would a guy try to grab someone from the back in the neck, and why wouldn't Arya see him coming?Â  And how does a grab around the neck cause such a wound?
Â 
Didn't like the Dany scene.Â  The guy is not attractive at all, and his butt is too flat.Â  Khal Drogo is a thousand times the man that guy with the beard is.Â 
Â 
Anyways, aside from those nitpicks, this episode was great.Â  Best part was the LittleFinger scene

339	Lord Carson	2014-05-23	Why didn't he just stab him instead of bite him?Â  And why was the other guy just standing there while Arya took out her sword and stabbed him?


The guy that bit him was Biter. Biting is his thing.
340	XTwipz	2014-05-24	Why didn't he just stab him instead of bite him?Â  And why was the other guy just standing there while Arya took out her sword and stabbed him?


The first guy seemed to be poor for me. How could he have buy a sword or a knife ? When I saw these guys, I thought "they do not seem really clever". Maybe that's all.Â
341	Thrones123	2014-05-25	thought jon might have had a little more support at the night's watch, the one guy at the top table seemed like he was about to agree with him but couldn't quite pull the trigger
Â 
bronn scene was touching, him and tyrion have both done a lot for each other, but it is true that bronn has risked his life, tyrion seemed to understand though
Â 
scene with oberyn was good too, his story about seeing tyrion for the first time was a bit drowned out, guess he was just trying to sympathize with him and that had he been born in dorne he would have been cared for better?
Â 
still unsure what littlefinger's long term plan is, obviously it goes way way back if it involved him manipulating lysa that long and getting her to kill her husband, blame it on the lannisters, and then turn the starks against the lannisters, he'll no doubt have some plan to keep control over the eyrie, either through robin or himself, still think its a possibility that he has in his mind to marry sansa
Â 
if i had to predict the outcome of the battle, i would think that oberyn would win, i think he is going to be a big character, from what i have gathered he seems to be a very strong fighter as well, especially if he wants to fight the mountain without any second thoughts
Â 
arya and the hound scene was good, was surprised to see that much compassion from the hound with the dying man, think they will continue to grow closer, and that they will stay together awhile, not sure if arya makes/stays at the eyrie
342	boojam	2014-05-27	The first guy seemed to be poor for me. How could he have buy a sword or a knife ? When I saw these guys, I thought "they do not seem really clever". Maybe that's all.Confusing in season 2, while Jaqen had become some kind of Lannister solider (never put any thing past a FM) R and B just seem un-uniformed lackeys (not of the Brave Companions recruits they became on the books)... still they seemed to be doing something , so they had been armed , why they were floating free was , I guess, due to the war chaos.
343	valirpaz	2014-05-30	Can any show-only watchers answer me why they would come here with spoilers all over the place? I'm assuming it's just people that don't care much about learning things ahead of time.


Exactly. Isn't that why they are called spoilers, because they spoil the fun? Why would I want some comments on what will happen? If I really wanna know, I'd read the books and get the full experience. I may do that once this season is over, to get over the break. But I agree with you it's sad how little traffic is in the non spoiler threads. I guess the people who really care are readers while most watchers don't bother about forums?
Â 


They further attempted to build Robin up as a spoiled brat during his scene with Sansa and snow castle, but to be honest, I felt like Sansa was just as big a brat in that scene, if not worse. It was her that got all bent out of shape when Robin accidentally knocked the tower over, and it seemed like Robin's initial response was just to defend himself. They both behaved like rotten children, but really I felt that Sansa came across as the more unreasonable one.


Well, one has to consider that Sansa probably is not so happy about the thought of marrying her cousin, who's still a child and the way he talked about him being the importand "Lord of the Vale" and throwing people out of the moondoor should make it obvious to her that he's a naive, if not crazy, child. Sansa was nice to him, and even after he breaks the tower she at first just calmly says, "You ruined it, now I have to build it again." Then it goes out of hand, true. Also at the very start of the scene when you see her building the castle, "The North Remembers" is played, which indicates that Sansa is quite emotional about her slaughtered family and burnt down home. So she may have overreacted but I find it understandable.

I think the day we can be sure about Littlefinger's longterm plans, is the day the show is boring.  In this case I have not a clue yet whether this was a plan or maybe for the first time ever an impulsive reaction but I doubt the latter. Maybe it is connected to the plan of Walder Frey (or is it Roose Bolton?) to take over the Eyrie? Would also be in the interest of the Lannisters to take down the last possible shelter for Stark kids. That Baelish has in mind to marry Sansa would make sense both on the emotional level as well as on the power level (making him ruler of Winterfell). His plan of course would have to include that Tyrion gets executed thus making her available again.
Â 
And I doubt Sansa would go for this marriage. Firstly I think she must have some respect (if not affection) for Tyrion after the way he treated her. Secondly she has experienced Baelish since her arrival in Kingslanding (he could have saved her father and didn't) so I'm sure she's aware of how dangerous and untrustworthy he is.
Â

I have to agree, especially from a storyline point of view. One had to think Tyrion stands no chance, now he suddenly has one. (I wanna see Cersei's face when she learns!) And Tyrion has been built up as a character from the first episode onwards, they have nicely started to build up Oberyn in this season, it would be weird to both kill them off in return for this insignificant butcher. But then, so many characters have already been killed off without fewer warning...
344	valirpaz	2014-05-30	The thing I'm left wondering is how LittleFinger is going to explain how Lysa died - it's either Sansa or LF that did it... maybe LF will say she was suicidal?Â  Maybe Robin ordered her to fly?Â  Or maybe the first person that comes in will take the blame?

I just thought about this. Hey, we saw the Red Lady being in the Vale. How about she being blamed for it, wouldn't that work perfectly?

Â I'm not sure about that. I think the direction they are going with Sansa is that she is going to take on a cunning, conniving personality. Littlefinger is rubbing off on her. The look on her face when Robin talked about getting rid of anybody that Sansa hated was one of intrigue, not repulsion, lol. She said she would like that very much. But yeah, she's been through a lot.

I'm currently reading the books, I mean I started to read the first one and I'm still reading the second now. So I can't really discuss in spoilers threads... I want to learn and discuss with people who love ASoIF and GoT like me but I just can't. It's not only what you said even if it's half true I think

392	darksellsword	2014-05-18	Not sure how I feel about Bron explaining himself to Tyrion but I guess they had to make changes considering how close they are on the tv show. hope its not a pattern they will continue with Shae
393	briantw	2014-05-18	So I guess this establishes that the Bronn marriage is important enough to include on the show.

Right? I'm beyond happy they included the castle building, but I really wanted to see Corbray almostÂ  recognize Sansa, and the Lords Declarant stuff as well. Really hoping the plot line moves forward from here to include the politics....
538	Jeb	2014-05-18	hahaha Brilliant. I love it when purists get so annoyed over pretty insignificant changes like this one (albeit a very popular line). That has made my week.

I guess it is because in my mind that's what I referred to that seen as. I would have been better though, Still a damn great scene
544	Scrambled Aegon	2014-05-18	I don't really mind the "Only Cat" -> "Your sister" change... but I was still really disappointed by that scene. It was so much more rushed compared to the books. We didn't getÂ nearly as much of a freakout by Lysa, and that's what makes the scene so good in the books: You really think Lysa's about to murder Sansa, and then she's breaking down to Petyr. And then he calms her down, and the mood of the chapter starts to get less and less tense... andÂ then it drops the bomb.
545	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-05-18	So many feels crammed into one episode! Even Ned feels were conjured on Essos.
546	veto	2014-05-18	one of the better ones this season for me , loved the way they handled all tyrions jail scenes , didnt mind the hotpie bit, can understand why they did that .
hope we get to see the hound again someday after this season ...
547	WTFSalami	2014-05-18	God damn you D&D, now I'm going to have to listen to people bitch about Littlefinger saying something different than he does in the book. 
Ugh, you guys pick the worst times to change things.
548	Raksha 2014	2014-05-18	Excellent pacing, the 55 minutes went by too fast.
Â 
I wish they had kept Sansa's important line "I feel stronger within the walls of Winterfell", and, of course, LF's "Only Cat."
Â 
Good acting by young SweetRobert. Â He's half pathetic in having been so pampered and isolated, and half dangerous in his spoiled brat desire to make people 'fly'. Â He already seems to be crushing on Sansa; promising to make anyone who displeases her "fly" once they're married. Â (wonder if they're actually foreshadowing something there)

robin had already helped though
555	Zman1863	2014-05-18	I don't object to them not using "Only Cat". But it felt like the Sansa sequence was a bit rushed. That's probably because they moved Lysa's revelations into an earlier episode. But I also wasn't thrilled with how the Snow Castle thing played out. I have no objection to Robin getting hit, but it seemed a bit simplified with no seizure. Having an older Robin is necessary because of the actor aging. But some of the infirmities he has would make a closer adaptation more plausible.
556	Colonel Green	2014-05-18	Both the snow castle and especially the Moon Door bit were way too fast.Â  There was barely an escalating tension (something the writers don't seem to be fond of, really) in the latter.Â  It would be nice if Sansa's plot could get as much screentime as it actually needs, rather than however much the writers have left when they're done writing everything else.
Â

Robin in the show has no health issues, to speak of, at this point.Â  That's pretty clear.

560	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-05-18	Only waaaaaah
561	WeStillKnowNothingJonSnow	2014-05-18	saying sister instead makes more since for the nonreaders. are they gonna pick up on "cat" instantly????
562	Haldebrandt	2014-05-18	"Only Cat" is the kind of stuff that takes a life of its own of forums like this. Â I read the books years ago and only recently learned on this very forum that was an iconic line -- on this forum. Â Never stood out to me otherwise. I wanna say it's really not that serious, but I do sympathize with those who are attached to it. Â But my point remains: I think the line grew into something because of this place and others like it, not because it was that great on its own.

563	marsyao	2014-05-18	I feel a little let down about the moon door scene, they should let Lysa tells us what happenes between littlefinger and her, forced abortion of her child, forced to marry to an old man she did not love etc. that would be much more powerful, now in front of us is just a crazy jealous woman and nothing more
564	sj4iy	2014-05-18	Also, the scene between Oberyn and Tyrion was a masterpiece of storytelling. Â Absolutely beautiful the way he talks about Tyrion as a baby. Â Perfectly done.
565	Kikiadiamond	2014-05-18	Well I learned one thing- never underestimate the importance of gravy.

566	Javi Marcos	2014-05-18	Why change that line? They win nothing avoiding it!!!
567	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-05-18	Maybe LF will tell them that she fell on accident.
Â 
The scene with Oberyn pleased me so much. I'm so happy they included the story about Oberyn's visit to Casterly Rock. That's something that was in the books that told me exactly how bad Cersei is.
Â 
After watching this, I want the Hound to get revenge on his brother so badly....sigh...
568	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-18	Only Cat can be forgiven. What cannot be forgiven is how they...rushed through that whole moondoor and snow winterfell.Â
569	ultimo12	2014-05-18	The dialogue in books is so good that it got NOT CHANGES.


Yeah I liked that too, they kept the Tyrion/cell scenes close to the book.
570	Khal Pod	2014-05-18	So what's going to happen with Brienne next season? Rorge and Biter are dead and the Bloody Mummers don't even exist.
571	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2014-05-18	Snowcastle scene was weak, but putting the stuff in about Cersei tormenting baby Tyrion back in was awesome, that conversation was one of my favorites in the entire series and I'm glad they put it back in.
572	sati	2014-05-18	Also, the scene between Oberyn and Tyrion was a masterpiece of storytelling. Â Absolutely beautiful the way he talks about Tyrion as a baby. Â Perfectly done.

definitely looks that way. and so it begins. good parallel. arya has learned from the hound. sansa has learned from littlefinger.

579	Stannis-the-Mannis	2014-05-18	They obviously changed the line because they weren't sure LF saying, "only Cat" would be understood as a reference to Catelyn stark.
Â 
in other news, we finally got an official LF reaction to the red wedding. He never spoke of it in the books IIRCÂ
580	JonInVa	2014-05-18	No biggie but it would have been so simple to combine LF's line to say something like:
"Only your sister"
Cut to her shocked face
"Only Cat"
Lysa go bye fly.

582	Chebyshov	2014-05-18	So I'm confused who's ear Gwendolyn was talking about biting off this season...guess it'll be a random Frey and then we meet LS?
Also, Shireen's going to be sacrificed, right? I had this hunch from the books but that scene almost confirmed it for me
583	white wolfpack	2014-05-18	Did I misinterpret in the books?  I was under the impression that snow Winterfell was life sized.  This one had a serious Spinal Tap/Stonehenge problem.

585	espec22	2014-05-18	Bronn's wife is not pregnant. That means there is not going to be a Bastard Tyrion baby
586	Darth Pipes	2014-05-18	D and D came through with their best script of the season and it was bolstered by a number of standout performances.Â 
Â 
Dinklage had one scene better than the other.Â  The first one with Jaime and the second one with Bronn ALMOST had me teary-eyed.Â  I'm glad they kept the Bronn storyline in, which I wasn't sure they would do considering how popular the character has become.Â  Love that they kept the final line in that scene with him hoping he'd hear that song.Â  Dinklage and Pascal manage to raise the bar even further with the Cersei story.
Â 
Fantastic adaptation of the death of Lysa.Â  Aiden has definitely done his best work of the season in the Eeryie.Â  Very sorry to be losing Kate Dickie but she was great in her short but important scene.
Â 
Hot Pie!Â  Was so glad to see him return.
Â 
Good stuff from Dany and Jorah.
Â 
The Hound's injury was contrived but I was fine with how everything played out.

I wish they hadn't wait so long in the game to reestablish the Mountain but at least they built up how much of a monster he is (and Cersei too).
587	of man and wolf	2014-05-18	Why change that line? They win nothing avoiding it!!!


They dont lose anything either.
588	Iron Maiden Islands	2014-05-18	Bet both Sansa and LF lie and say Lysa fell.

Definitely a little trickier that using a pasty, but you're probably right
589	Stannis I	2014-05-18	So what's going to happen with Brienne next season? Rorge and Biter are dead and the Bloody Mummers don't even exist.

591	YourMomsBox	2014-05-18	Yeahhh...I read all of the books and I don't get why everyone is so upset by the little change in that line. Perhaps I am missing something but "your sister" vs "only Cat". Meh be disappointed if need be but I didn't think it was worth majorly griping about. Still a terrific scene.
592	Darth Pipes	2014-05-18	Bronn's wife is not pregnant. That means there is not going to be a Bastard Tyrion baby


Â 
It could be changed to his natural son.Â  I wouldn't be surprised to see Bronn pop up inÂ court next season.Â  Could make the King's Landing storyline a little interesting.Â
593	StarkBlack21	2014-05-18	They won't sacrifice Shireen. Stannis or Davos will save her.

Nobody is disappointed by that? That scene on the whispers where she kills the members of the Bloody Mummers was awesome, and Gendry stabbing Biter through the back of the head was awesome.

596	HazelPhoenixFire	2014-05-18	They really can't get any of the one-liners right in this show, can they?

Â 
Unfortunately they keep ad-libbing when the source material got it right. What is with the shortened running time? This week started late and stopped early. I'm really frustrated that they seem to be saving the battle at the Wall for the end, it would have made a more exciting season to incorporate that plotline earlier. The pacing just seems excruciatingly slow this year, and it's not as if there's not enough material to pull from the books. So far I'm really disappointed in how they chose to weave the major points. Â

598	l2 0 5 5	2014-05-18	I'm disappointed in the Tyrion/Oberyn scene because I think this means that he won't be announcing it in front of the whole court like he did in the book which was so awesome due to all of the shocked onlookers and Tywin. I enjoyed the scene I just think it means that they're cutting the final court scene.
Â 
Hot Pie pop up was cool. Â Arya/Sandor was a nice couple scenes as well.
Â 
Dany's scenes were pretty good. Â Still interested in seeing how they are gonna send Jorah away.
Â 
LF pushing Lysa out was great. Still get annoyed by his voice from time to time.
Â 
Sansa slapping Sweet Robin was very satisfying.
Â 
I find the Mel/whoever is next to her fire-staring scenes really annoying.
Â 
A decent way of implementing the third Mountain to be on the show. The show has done a pretty bad job of giving the audience a reason to hate The Mountain.
Â 
The Tyrion/Bronn scene was my favorite. Pretty much word for word from the novel. Â 
Â 
Overall the episode was pretty good.

600	ultimo12	2014-05-18	Would someone who follows only the show even have realised who "Cat" is, without having to think about it for a sec?
Â 
Saying "your sister" just makes it more clear.
601	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-18	Well that episode was awesome.
602	jons nissa	2014-05-18	Worst acting in this episode? Plenty of candidates, but I'd go for: "Hoo am Oi Foighting?"


Â 
but the mountain isn't supposed to be cast for his great acting ability, is he?
Â 


  The first was much douchier.Â 


Â 
i agree. and the douchiness is what made him great for the role, imo. wonder why they are implying rather than showing. never known hbo to shy away from a chance to show a sex scene.
Â 
also really enjoyed the scene with tyrion and jaime. so clear how much they love each other. it will make the betrayal that much harder to stomach. Â  
Â 
surprised they were so blunt about her tricks but i think the show explaining how the trick shows the way to the truth makes me more sympathetic to melisandre than grrm's pov chapter. and omg, somebody take shireen away from the red burny lady. please! davos, come to the rescue!!!!
603	TaenaOfMyr	2014-05-18	Bronn's wife is not pregnant. That means there is not going to be a Bastard Tyrion baby

I was pleasantly surprised that they kept him marrying Lollys in at all. I fully expected him to simply decline it due to the Mountain being the opponent. Very happy to see how faithful they were there, even if they later end up cutting that part of the storyline with Bronn. Although I guess this means his role with Jaime is out now.
604	franko99	2014-05-18	Who do you think will be taking the blame for Lysa's death? There were no one else on the room to take Marillion's place. I remember reading Mord will be this season, but it won't make any sense since he wasn't even there?
605	Obebb	2014-05-18	Did anyone else think Dany and Daario happened way too fast?
Â 
I loved the snow castle scene
Â 
I'm just sad he didn't say only Cat
606	ultimo12	2014-05-18	Also I don't understand why some people weren't happy with Aidan Gillen as Littlefinger, he's perfect for that role. It's one of those occasions where i, when i reread the books, put my own imagination completely aside and replace it with both the face and the voice from the show.

Very happy to see how faithful they were there, even if they later end up cutting that part of the storyline with Bronn. Although I guess this means his role with Jaime is out now.


Â I agree, but it seemed like Bronn was much nicer and more sympathetic with Tyrion in the show. I seem to remember him being more of a douche in the novels. Basically telling him to f off, its not his problem anymore. Of course I could be wrong.
609	Colonel Green	2014-05-18	I remember reading Mord will be this season


I don't think there's any actual indications of that.Â  That was just a misreading some people had of an interview with the actor who plays Robin (given in a foreign language).
610	Fez	2014-05-18	So what's going to happen with Brienne next season? Rorge and Biter are dead and the Bloody Mummers don't even exist.


Â 
TWOW?
Â 
Although, I think its more likely that she reaches Jaime at Riverun around episode 7 (having not shown up much before then in the season), hangs out with him in ep 8, isn't in 9, and they leave together in ep. 10. Or something like that.
Â 
It really depends on how quickly Jaime's plotline moves next season I guess.
611	NikkiG	2014-05-18	Loved the episode and not that bent out of shape about the "Only Cat" substitution.Â  Not sure what is going to motivate Sansa to save Littlefinger's skin next episode unless she is using it for leverage over him in the future...
612	jons nissa	2014-05-18	Did anyone else think Dany and Daario happened way too fast?


Â 
totally!

Also, can we take a moment to appreciate Hot Pie's bread sculpting abilities?


Â 
 Â  Â
613	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-18	Solid episode. Kinda pissed they omitted "only cat", but it still worked. What I am more mad about is that Brienne will clearly never be fighting Rorge or Biter now. Was I the only one who couldn't believe how easily those 2 went down? Wasn't Rorge a pretty big badass in the books?
614	booknerd2	2014-05-18	I cannot believe the Hound is going to go down from a frigging bite wound.


Â 
I knowâ<U+0080>¦ridiculous.
Â 
So I guess Elder Brother gets a wooly scarf? Silly.
Â 
Eh, I guess the robe and cowl should cover it.
615	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-18	We're seriously dissecting one line from the Mountain? Would you be happier with Michael Caine playing the role?
616	Zman1863	2014-05-18	Also I don't understand why some people weren't happy with Aidan Gillen as Littlefinger, he's perfect for that role. It's one of those occasions where i, when i reread the books, put my own imagination completely aside and replace it with both the face and the voice from the show.


Â 
I don't get the accent complaints, mainly because I have no ear for accents. But I agree that the character is not as subtle and mysterious as he is in the books- TV LF seems to tell everyone exactly what his plans are all the time. But mainly, that's a writing and direction issue, not a performance one.Â
617	Fool of a Book	2014-05-18	Couple things... seemed like Mel admitted she's full of crap and knows more about magic tricks than R'hollor secrets. Â Strange.
Â 
Also, the man that the Hound mercy-killed, making a specific statement about the North always making a fair trade. Â That's gonna mean something.
Â 
Dany is boring as hell. Â Emilia is not working it out.
618	ultimo12	2014-05-18	Solid episode. Kinda pissed they omitted "only cat", but it still worked. What I am more mad about is that Brienne will clearly never be fighting Rorge or Biter now.

They never established him as one in the show though.
619	Raksha 2014	2014-05-18	Also, the scene between Oberyn and Tyrion was a masterpiece of storytelling. Â Absolutely beautiful the way he talks about Tyrion as a baby. Â Perfectly done.


Â 
Â 
I missed the bit about Elia cooing over baby Tyrion and wanting to hold him, that was in the book; but I guess it wasn't essential to the show (though it did show Elia, a woman about whom we know comparatively little, other than her horrible last moments, as a person with a great capacity for tenderness and kindness, her heart going out to the motherless infant when many Westerosi girls would have been horrified at the idea of cuddling a dwarf baby).
Â 
But I loved the scene. Â Poor Tyrion, he's at his lowest point, and then Oberyn gives him reason to hope.
620	jons nissa	2014-05-18	Â Not sure what is going to motivate Sansa to save Littlefinger's skin next episode unless she is using it for leverage over him in the future...


Â 
she smiled when littlefinger insinuates that he killed joffrey because he'd harmed her family. she'll cover for him.Â
621	YourMomsBox	2014-05-18	I think ultimo is right. That is what I thought was the logic behind the line change. Casuals could be sort of confused and forget who Cat is. She hadn't been called "Cat" for a couple seasons anyhow. It just made it more clear for some viewers.
622	Obebb	2014-05-18	I'm disappointed in the Tyrion/Oberyn scene because I think this means that he won't be announcing it in front of the whole court like he did in the book which was so awesome due to all of the shocked onlookers and Tywin. I enjoyed the scene I just think it means that they're cutting the final court scene.
Â 


Â 
No, in the books he did not announce it in front of the whole court. He did it privately just like in the show
623	ultimo12	2014-05-18	Â 
Dany is boring as hell. Â Emilia is not working it out.


That's more down to the source material though. IMO.
624	Batavian	2014-05-18	I'm disappointed in the Tyrion/Oberyn scene because I think this means that he won't be announcing it in front of the whole court

Agreed! I think it would have been so much more dramatic for the announcement to come as a surprise to all.
625	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-18	Solid episode. Kinda pissed they omitted "only cat", but it still worked. What I am more mad about is that Brienne will clearly never be fighting Rorge or Biter now. Was I the only one who couldn't believe how easily those 2 went down? Wasn't Rorge a pretty big badass in the books?


I legit lol'd at Rorge dying the way he did. My only problem with the episode.
626	Khal Pod	2014-05-18	Â 
TWOW?
Â 
Although, I think its more likely that she reaches Jaime at Riverun around episode 7 (having not shown up much before then in the season), hangs out with him in ep 8, isn't in 9, and they leave together in ep. 10. Or something like that.
Â 
It really depends on how quickly Jaime's plotline moves next season I guess.


So do you think that next season will include all of Feast and Dance? I assume they use that content over the course of the next two seasons.
627	Chebyshov	2014-05-18	Â 
Also, the man that the Hound mercy-killed, making a specific statement about the North always making a fair trade. Â That's gonna mean something.

Yeah I'm assuming foreshadowing for something to come in TWOW? That seemed odd and pointed.

Ok, so, who do you think is going to be framed for Lysa's death, some random guard? They'll say she commit suicide? Â
630	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-18	Nobody is disappointed by that? That scene on the whispers where she kills the members of the Bloody Mummers was awesome, and Gendry stabbing Biter through the back of the head was awesome.


I'm upset by both of these things. Not understanding the pacing of Brienne's storyline AT ALL.
631	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-18	Would someone who follows only the show even have realised who "Cat" is, without having to think about it for a sec?
Â 
Saying "your sister" just makes it more clear.


Â 
Anyone who follows the show really should remember a certain wedding that took place last season. If they don't then they aren't followers of the show.
Â 
I am not overly concerned about the change. I would have prefered the original given that it showed the biggest weakness Baelish has. On that front 'Only Cat' is a crack of light just shining through on his motivations. 'Your sister' doesn't provide the same insight. If 'the audience is too stupid' is a thing, then there is no reason they couldn't have said 'Your sister' then 'Only Cat' as she fell.
632	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-18	The only thing that disappointed me was that it seems like Oberyn's story Â has been cut - the one about the scorpions and Cersei offering herself to him.
Â 
Snow castle / Lysa's fall was good stuff for as adaptations go, IMO.
633	Chebyshov	2014-05-18	So do you think that next season will include all of Feast and Dance? I assume they use that content over the course of the next two seasons.

IMO it'll definitely only be one season. Especially in light of all the "7 season plan" interviews.
634	Bastard of Boston	2014-05-18	I wish the Winterfell show castle would've been handled with a little more care. It's my favorite Sansa chapter.

This. I was like "Rorge? Um, that's not right."

It's got nothing to do with "stupidity".
640	StarkBlack21	2014-05-18	I think Bronn will still travel with Jamie to the Riverlands. There's nothing to preclude him from joining Jamie.
641	Raksha 2014	2014-05-18	I wish the Winterfell show castle would've been handled with a little more care. It's my favorite Sansa chapter.


Â 
Â 
They really should have had her say "I am stronger within the walls of Winterfell", it's an important part of the changes she's going through in the books. Â Unless we can assume that she wasn't given that line to say because book-Sansa never returns to Winterfell?
642	Ramsay Blow	2014-05-18	So Rorge and Biter are dead that quick? I didn't like that at all, odd choice.
643	Chebyshov	2014-05-18	I think Bronn will still travel with Jamie to the Riverlands. There's nothing to preclude him from joining Jamie.

Agreed. I think that pairing works quite well
644	TheHouseHB	2014-05-18	I wonder after watching this episode that Mel set up Jon's attempted assassination at the end of Dance. Mel would then use the time while Jon is out to burn Shireen using her blood for kings blood to awake dragons from stone. Jon while alive and well would never let Mel burn Shireen so Mel needed to knock Jon out for a while and used Bowen and company.Â
645	Obebb	2014-05-18	Was I the only one who couldn't believe how easily those 2 went down? Wasn't Rorge a pretty big badass in the books?

Not the only one, I think it was weird. He just stands there and gets stabbed. And what even happened to Biter? The Hound throws him off and suddenly he's done. I don't know, maybe I have to rewatch it.

"no more than 8" was the most recent I've seen IIRC
649	Stannis I	2014-05-18	Excellent episode, in my opinion.Â 
Â 
Best parts:
Â 
- Selyse and Melisandre dialogue. It seems Shireen will have a role to play in the future;
- Tyrion and Bronn dialogue;
- Tyrion and Oberyn speaking about how they met. Pity they didn't put the whole dialogue, when Oberyn tells Tyrion how he believes Tywin murdered Elia and her children to 'pay a debt', since Aerys chose Elia instead of Cersei to marry Rhaegar;
- Robin being Joffrey (I'll make those who bother me fly);
- Lysa Arryn flying (she was bothering me, so...).
Â 
Not so good:
Â 
- Dario Naharys. I don't think this Dario is as cocky as the other one. He just seems nice;
- New Mountain, who doesn't ride (or act, for all I can tell).
Â 
And, by the description of the next episodes on IMDB, I'd say Stannis is not going to reach the wall this season (Mance Rayder isn't in any of the previews so far), but we definetely will have Hazzea!

Â 
I agree that if they had kept the line it wouldn't have been unreasonably confusing. Many would have gotten it right off and many more would have gotten it later or looked it up. This thing called the internet is used by many show viewers and I would think that if they are confused, they are fully capable of doing a few simple searches to find the answer. It's what I do with Mad Men when I see something odd that I can't figure out.Â 
Â 
They do have a tendency to dumb things down to an extreme extent at times, especially for a show with lots of original source material that can be consulted at any time.Â
651	ultimo12	2014-05-18	I prefer big mountaineous looking guy who looks like he can do some serious damage over a good actor for The Mountain tbh.

652	darksellsword	2014-05-18	They aged Jorah like 40 years looks like Dany left him out in the sun to rot as well, it is all very contrived anything they could do to make the Dany Shagging Daario more believable. I think it would of been smarter to have Daario sent off scouting and omitted the whole thing from the show. New Daario is awful.
653	sj4iy	2014-05-18	QFT.
Also, can we take a moment to appreciate Hot Pie's bread sculpting abilities?


Â 
I even mentioned to my husband that he did get much better since the last attempt.
Â 
Also, Brienne knows that Arya's alive. Â Wonder how that might come into play for Lady Stoneheart.
654	doghouse	2014-05-18	I read the books last year and I don't remember half of the things you guys are mentioning. I thought it was difficult to get through the last two books or even care about characters I had invested in earlier in the book series. If they are speeding up Dany's storyline, thank god because it was torturous to read through. I liked the way Arya just stabbed that guy in the heart. I didn't know he was supposed to live for another plotline but I enjoyed the way she just killed without hesitation.Â
655	Darth Pipes	2014-05-18	Caught one bit of information...Walder Frey is Lord of Rivverun on the show.Â  Makes sense.

So he gets to the Wall then.
658	Seer of Green	2014-05-18	Bronn's wife is not pregnant. That means there is not going to be a Bastard Tyrion baby

It looks to me like they're speeding up Brienne's quest in the show vs. the book. We may get the Lady Stoneheart reveal at the end of her quest as the final scene in episode 10 this season.
And I say bravo. Because the Brienne storyline was a massive waste of time in the books, and the single worst storyline in the entire ASOIAF series. The more speeding up they do to it the better.
661	Starkfyre Barathyrell	2014-05-18	did they reuse the inn from two swords?
662	l2 0 5 5	2014-05-18	Â 
No, in the books he did not announce it in front of the whole court. He did it privately just like in the show


Yeah he hinted to Tyrion that he could champion him but who was to say if he was being serious. Â He announced and confirmed it during the final trial in front of the whole court.
663	jarl the climber	2014-05-18	Â 
she smiled when littlefinger insinuates that he killed joffrey because he'd harmed her family. she'll cover for him.Â 


Because Joffrey almost got Cat killed with his scheme to assasinate Bran, of course the show hasn't got there yet but its coming and Joffrey was just the start, his days were numbered the day Cat came to Kings landing with that knife in Littlefingers mind. Getting revenge for the Red Wedding hasn't even started yet.
664	Khal Pod	2014-05-18	At least they're staying true to the books by testing our patience with the week off.
665	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-05-18	I think Stannis reaches the Wall in the last episode, based on information we've seen. I hope so. I can't wait 
Â 
I'm wondering if Brienne will meet the Mad Mouse on her journey to the Vale. I'd also love to see the Stoney Sept scene. It's one of my favorites in the series.
666	Moseh Khayim	2014-05-18	Now, you can argue whether or not to nitpick on the "Only Cat" scene. And sure, it's just a single oneliner. But it seems as though D&D just have to be altering slight things to keep the show theirs. As if they have a desperate need to prove themselves.Â 
Â 
What's next? Will "Elia!" be cut? "Stannis!"?
667	Fez	2014-05-18	So do you think that next season will include all of Feast and Dance? I assume they use that content over the course of the next two seasons.


Â 
I really do. I mean, there might be a couple storylines that won't be done (Sam if his arc doesn't change, possibly the Kings Landing plot, etc.), but for most part I think Feast and Dance are done by the end of the next season.
Â 
The way I see, regardless of whether the show is 7 or 8 seasons (and I think it'll be 7), D&D are going to want to spend more time on the conclusion, not the middle-ground. If its 7 seasons, then they have to get to TWOW by the end of season 5, and if its 8 seasons then that's time better served as an extra season for TWOW/ADOS (which are presumably going to be very plot heavy books).
Â 
Also, imagine how bad it'd be if they planned on 8 seasons, and only got midway through Feast and Dance by the end of season 5, only to be told that nope, HBO needs it be 7 seasons, and then they only have two seasons for two and a half books.
668	MoIaF	2014-05-18	I enjoyed the episode, it was solid.
669	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-05-18	I was really disappointed with the snow castle scene. Â I was hoping it would be more emotional for Sansa. Â I have been reading comments by "unsullied" tv-show fans and no one seems to care about that scene.

Not the only one, I think it was weird. He just stands there and gets stabbed. And what even happened to Biter? The Hound throws him off and suddenly he's done. I don't know, maybe I have to rewatch it.

671	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-05-18	OH MY FUCK!!!! THERE GOING TO BURN SHIREEN!!!
672	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-18	I told you all that Shireen will be the important part in Stannis' plot, k? You didn't believe me!Â They obviously changed the line because they weren't sure LF saying, "only Cat" would be understood as a reference to Catelyn stark.Â in other news, we finally got an official LF reaction to the red wedding. He never spoke of it in the books IIRCÂ she smiled when littlefinger insinuates that he killed joffrey because he'd harmed her family. she'll cover for him.I took it as he killed Joffrey because he used to hurt Sansa. Joffrey had nothing to do with the RW.Or, he plainly lied.Â Bronn's wife is not pregnant. That means there is not going to be a Bastard Tyrion babyThere is still time. By the end of the next season, there will be probably a baby Tyrion XD

675	WTFSalami	2014-05-18	Unfortunately they keep ad-libbing when the source material got it right. What is with the shortened running time? This week started late and stopped early. I'm really frustrated that they seem to be saving the battle at the Wall for the end, it would have made a more exciting season to incorporate that plotline earlier. The pacing just seems excruciatingly slow this year, and it's not as if there's not enough material to pull from the books. So far I'm really disappointed in how they chose to weave the major points. 

Seriously? This has easily been the most well-paced season of the series. We're spending so much time with these characters instead of just jumping around from camp to camp and adding every character into every episode that hurt season 2 so much. 
This season has exceeded expectations for me. Everything they're doing is so fantastic.

Â 
HAH!Â
677	WTFSalami	2014-05-18	I don't remember from the books - was Jon for or against clogging the tunnel at castle black?
Against it. He was given Bowen Marsh's lines, and Ser Alliser was given Jon's lines.
678	Raksha 2014	2014-05-18	OH MY FUCK!!!! THERE GOING TO BURN SHIREEN!!!


Â 
Â 
Oh, I hope not. Â Or at least that they want to, but don't succeed, somebody stops them or sends Shireen away (though to where I couldn't imagine, there aren't too many safe places up north).
679	jons nissa	2014-05-18	loved how tyrion got teary eyed when oberyn was telling him the story of the visit. one can see all the emotions he's feeling as he hears himself described as a monster, how cersei says he killed their mother and then how she twists his penis. heartbreaking. and the little laugh when oberyn says a little pink cock. great scene!

Â 
What's next? Will "Elia!" be cut? "Stannis!"?


Â 
They don't have to 'prove themselves'. Â They're successful, their show is successful and they are doing a fantastic job.
Â 
The only people who feel like they have anything to prove are the ones complaining about it on internet forums.

681	Khal Pod	2014-05-18	It looks to me like they're speeding up Brienne's quest in the show vs. the book. We may get the Lady Stoneheart reveal at the end of her quest as the final scene in episode 10 this season.
And I say bravo. Because the Brienne storyline was a massive waste of time in the books, and the single worst storyline in the entire ASOIAF series. The more speeding up they do to it the better.


I strongly disagree.
682	Justin Danford	2014-05-18	Yeah he hinted to Tyrion that he could champion him but who was to say if he was being serious. Â He announced and confirmed it during the final trial in front of the whole court.


Â 
I very much wanted to see a whole court reveal of Oberyns choice to defend Tyrion.
Â 
I really wanted to see it during the trial. Something like:
Â 
"And who will you name for your champion?" Cersie looks smug naming the Mountain. Tywin looking vicious Jamie looking concerned.
Â 
Tyrion says nothing. Looking around, semi-panicked.
Â 
"Looks like you are all alone, baby brother." Cersie says. Oberyn rises from his seat.
Â 
"No. Not alone."
683	Table8	2014-05-18	Against it. He was given Bowen Marsh's lines, and Ser Alliser was given Jon's lines. 
Thanks.  Thats what i thought.  Hearing Kit saying that on the show didn't feel right.

Â 
Â 
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â I respectfully disagree, but that's most likely just due to personal preference.  I actually enjoyed season 2, but I binge-watched three seasons and I think that makes a difference. While I have liked the cleaner transitions in this season, I feel as though they have skimped on some of the more interesting moments and focused on things that didn't necessarily lend much to the story. The scenes of Yara/Asha going to recover Theon were really peculiar and didn't have much of a payoff (although I know they needed to end what they began, it was strange to build up that "epic rescue" only to have her run away from two dogs and a shirtless Ramsay). This seemed to take the place of a Mereeneese takeover and I would have rather seen that.
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Arya killing the hound, Coldhands, Lady Stoneheart, Oberyn's fight and the Night's Watch battle are being pushed toward the end while Stannis goes to the bank and Melisandre stares into the fire again. To me they're just reestablishing some of the things they've already setup with previous shots. They have multitude of scenes to cherry-pick from in George's writing and it seems like sometimes they go with some really odd choices. I will say however that Tyrion's scenes and all the subsequent King's Landing intrigue have been stellar this season. The trial was outstanding and I loved the casting choice for Oberyn. I also loved Brienne/Podrick and Arya/The Hound, I can't wait for the last three episodes!Â

685	Ser Steven	2014-05-18	Who do you think will be taking the blame for Lysa's death? There were no one else on the room to take Marillion's place. I remember reading Mord will be this season, but it won't make any sense since he wasn't even there?

Neither was anyone else to say he wasn't.

The line change was completely meaningless. But people always have to complain about something, especially people who are obsessed over any change to the show, even one as insignificant as this.
687	sj4iy	2014-05-18	I don't remember from the books - was Jon for or against clogging the tunnel at castle black?


Â 
Against it, but only after the Wildling attack was over. Â He was LC and Marsh kept hounding him to seal up the gate.
688	MoIaF	2014-05-18	OH MY FUCK!!!! THERE GOING TO BURN SHIREEN!!!

That's the first thing I thought. A pit just set in my stomach, what are they going to do to that poor little girl.
689	Paul Baratheon	2014-05-18	Two things:
1. They are gonna burn shireen?
2. Is gilly gonna die next week?
690	StarkBlack21	2014-05-18	Shireen isn't getting burned. Either Stannis or Davos will save her. Shireen will be going to the wall with Stannis and crew.

This season has exceeded expectations for me. Everything they're doing is so fantastic.


Â 
I agree 100%Â 
Â 
Look at the stuff we have been treated with...
Â 
* Liberation of Mereen (Nice, quick and simple. Better than the books)
Â 
* Purple Wedding (Loved every minute of it)
Â 
* White Walker Babies!!! (SPOILERS!!!!)

* The Liberation of Craster's Keep (More interesting than book version)
Â 
* The Trial (Maybe the best GoT performance in the series)
Â 
* Moon Door.Â 
Â 
Â 
This season has been stacked and there has been little down time.Â
692	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-18	It looks to me like they're speeding up Brienne's quest in the show vs. the book. We may get the Lady Stoneheart reveal at the end of her quest as the final scene in episode 10 this season.

Â 
Yep - it had some really good scenes but it was painfully obvious when reading that the entire quest was padding. It desperately needed heavy editing.
693	Stannis I	2014-05-18	Â 
Description of the last episode says that the NW gets help from an unexpected source.
Â 
So he gets to the Wall then.


But Mance doesn't help... he attacks!
But I confess I have no idea who's coming from the north to help the NW...
694	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-18	Â 
Â 
* White Walker Babies!!! (SPOILERS!!!!)


Â 
Â 
Why do people keep saying this was a spoiler?
Â 
Sam is told what happens to the baby boys before he flees Craster's.Â
695	Zman1863	2014-05-18	Against it. He was given Bowen Marsh's lines, and Ser Alliser was given Jon's lines.


Â 
Yes. It makes practical sense with a big army about to assault the gate to seal it up so TV Jon is arguing the right course, but it makes little sense for the post wildling assault phase. If they weren't going to do "only Cat" for sake of not confusing the unsullied, will they have Jon do a complete 180 with the changed threat from unified Wildlings to broken Wildlings plus Others?
696	Khal Pod	2014-05-18	Â

Â 
"No. Not alone."


Well as of right now, (in show universe) Tyrion could quite realistically be the only one who knows that Oberyn will champion for him (aside from Ellaria). So we can still hope for an on-screen reveal to the court.
697	mendicantbias	2014-05-18	NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT HIZZY GOING TO YUNKAI?
698	Dain Storm	2014-05-18	OH MY FUCK!!!! THERE GOING TO BURN SHIREEN!!!

If Stannis isn't involved, I hope he kills them both with his bare hands.
699	Table8	2014-05-18	Solid episode and I need to watch again before I can review.  But there was definitely pacing problems.  That last scene with Lysa was just...rushed.  There should have been more dialogue from Petyr calming her down.  Even non book readers knew what to expect when Petyr said he only loved one woman.
Also, what was that with Daario?  There was no build up to that at all.  Just queen Dany getting horny.  If they spent a scene or two in prior episodes where maybe Dany confides with Missandei about being attracted to him, I could stomach the scene more. 
Surprising they took out Rorge and Biter, but whatever.  No big deal.
Loved the Oberyn/Tyrion scene.  Was wondering if they would mention Oberyn's visit to CR, and they did.  So cool.
700	NOT A TARG I SWEAR	2014-05-18	So Rorge and Biter are dead that quick? I didn't like that at all, odd choice.


Ya that was really bizarre. To reintroduce 2 tertiary characters that many probably don't remember that well from the 1st/2nd seasons for a brief instant and to off them in that awkward manner was just weird.
701	MoIaF	2014-05-18	Shireen isn't getting burned. Either Stannis or Davos will save her. Shireen will be going to the wall with Stannis and crew.

Oh I don't think it would happen mow, but having Mel say there is a purpose in her going with them to the Wall does give me at least some concern.  Mel's purposes aren't always good.
702	OnlyOne	2014-05-18	snow needs to beat allistor's arse

Well, a little more than that I hope.
703	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-18	It's been a long time since this show has given us a truly epic "slap the shit out of someone" moment.Â  Good, loud, crisp, worthy to stand beside Tyrion/Joffrey I and Tyrion/Joffrey II.Â  I think I love everything about that scene, like even the lighting and the camera angle and how Sophie Turner's hair seemed to be the only thing with any color in it.Â  I can -- and have -- praised all the child actors on this show all day long, and they're all really good but even in all that gushing praise there's still room for more.Â  I don't even remember his name but the kid playing Sweetrobin is, like the rest, pitch perfect.Â  Right mix of dorky and ADD and spoiled little shit and total weenie, he's fantastic.
Â 
We got the stinker lines we knew were coming out of the way in this episode.Â  "Nothing is just nothing" and "they can live in my new world or they can die in my old one."Â  The respective actors did their best to save as much of them as they could.
Â 
Speaking of Dany stuff, did y'all catch that bit Jorah said?Â  "I wouldn't be here if Ned Stark treated me like you are treating the masters."Â  HO LEE SHIT.Â  A retcon, but that's a darn good one.Â  Jorah's sticking around Dany for way longer in this continuity and his voice of reason is staying reasonable for far longer, as well, so I welcome this brief moment of Dany hearing the pro-Ned message.Â  Even if ultimately Dany shouldn't have it stick.
Â 
I was NOT expecting Hot Pie to show up again, and at first I got impatient with him taking all this time to wax poetic about food and the preparation thereof, and then it hit me:Â  it's not a deviation from the source material, it is the TRUEST ADHERENCE to the source material.Â  A big, long, pointless, enthusiastic food derail.Â  It needed to be there.Â  Really, to recreate the book experience he needs to show up and do that every episode from here on out.
Â 
LOLLYS STOKEWORTH EXISTS.Â  Good for her.
Â 
The big ongoing mystery, of course, remains WHOSE EAR WILL BRIENNE BITE OFF?Â  Gwen Christie promised us it was coming.Â  The early frontrunner, Locke, got his neck Hodored.Â  Tonight another contender drops, oddly enough once again due to a Hodored broken neck.Â  We didn't hear his name, but they showed him in the "previously on" section and he showed up with Rorge, and he bit Sandor Clegane in the neck, so I presume that was Biter.Â  And I presume Sandor will turn into a vampire instead of a gravedigger in this continuity now.Â  Just kidding.Â  Maybe?
Â 
Admit it.Â  You thought HBO was going to have Mel and Selyse have sex.Â  My personal headcanon takes a bit of a hit as Melly wasn't sporting her ruby choker, but if I closely rewatched old episodes I'd probably notice this isn't the first time.
Â 
So we won't be getting the "rape an innkeeper's daughter, demand change for a silver" buildup for Gregor The Mountain to cement him as the evilest most terrifying motherfucker walking GRRM's Green GRRth.Â  Maybe that's for the best.Â  I suppose the training montage/promo package of him splitting dudes in half with swords will be enough.Â  And Pedro Pascal as Oberyn reminding us that he's been looking to wreck Gregor's shit for years.Â  Was disappointed we didn't get the veiled "your father... may not live forever" threat, but then Davos and The Iron Bank basically told us Tywin Was Going To Die last week so maybe it doesn't matter.Â  Anyway, the Pay Per View Main Event is set between The Viper And The Mountain and we get an extra week of wait and unsullied speculation.
Â 
For the fifth consecutive episode, The Roose Was Not Loose.Â  Definitely the weak point of this season.
Â 
Sansa are you seriously going to walk right up to the edge of Deathtrap Ex Machina like that do you have rocks in your head okay seriously folks anyone who ever wants to argue that Sansa is less of a Stark than the rest of them SHUT THE FUCK UP because that's daddy's Utter Lack Of Self-Preservation Instinct on glorious display.Â  Sansa is a True Stark.Â  Well, okay, except she survived, that's rather un-Starky of her.
Â 
I really wanted "Only Cat."Â  Most of us did, by the looks of it.Â  But we got the shove, at least.Â  Not sure how they're going to work around the lack of a patsy to pin it on.Â  I guess the story has to be Lysa Slipped On A Banana Peel.Â  Lords Declarant are going to show up next week and the first impression of them will be "complete morons" because they'll have to buy that story.Â  Ah well.Â  Kate Dickie's Watch Is Ended, and she was a fantastic Lysa Arryn-Tully.Â  Every bit as bugfuck crazy and fatally smitten with LF as I ever imagined.Â  I hope she got to keep that fake boobie from Season 1.
Â 
And the banana peel of doom is on its way to the Iron Islands to finally pay off Leech #3
Â 
Oh hey, Jon Snow has a good idea and the senior members of the watch aren't listening.Â  I'm sure that's the last time that will ever happen.Â  Too bad for them being a moron DOES get you killed in this story.Â  Slynt is such a great slimy little kiss ass shit, he gets one line an episode and he wrings maximum smarmy shitheel out of that one line, hats off to him.Â  I'm gonna have a cigar on the night of the episode where Jon kills him.Â  And that's one more line than Dolorous Edd got this week.Â  For shame.
704	OnlyOne	2014-05-18	Oh I don't think it would happen mow, but having Mel say there is a purpose in her going with them to the Wall does give me at least some concern.  Mel's purposes aren't always good.

Yes I would've liked that a lot too. Â I think for the sake of entertainment that it would've been more shocking and intense if he would've revealed it in front of everyone. Â One of my favorite scenes in the book.
706	The Lizard King	2014-05-18	Maybe LF will tell them that she fell on accident.
Â 
The scene with Oberyn pleased me so much. I'm so happy they included the story about Oberyn's visit to Casterly Rock. That's something that was in the books that told me exactly how bad Cersei is.
Â 
After watching this, I want the Hound to get revenge on his brother so badly....sigh...


Â 
I have a feeling in a future book that the gravedigger on the Quiet Isle and Ser Robert Strong will have a duel to the death.
Â 
Give it time.
707	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-05-18	Shireen isn't getting burned. Either Stannis or Davos will save her. Shireen will be going to the wall with Stannis and crew.


Â 
Ummm... they're not going to burn her now. Â You do know what happens in the very last Jon chapter in ADwD, don't you? Â 
Â 
I am really getting worried they will have to burn her to save Jon. Â Honestly, I would rather see Jon die for good if Shireen is the price.
708	teej6	2014-05-18	Great touch playing the Winterfell music when showing Sansa in the snow.Â
709	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-18	Kinda funny that The Dreadfort is on the map -- despite no scenes there this week -- and The Eyrie remains off, despite being prominently featured this week, and having previously been an opening credits map location, which would in theory make it easier to add back in than adding a new location from scratch.
Â 
We didn't go to Braavos either of course but I don't care because that coin rolling down the slot is dear to me.

Â 
Yeah, it's not going to happen now. We know that Shireen gets to the Wall and specifically Castle Black by the time Jon gets assassinated. Melisandre has plenty of incentive to drop a bomb following that event, whether to revive Jon or otherwise. And no one is going to stand up for Shireen. The NW is in disarray and the wildlings believe she's cursed. The writing's on the wall in the books.
711	bigchiefbc	2014-05-18	Â 
I agree that if they had kept the line it wouldn't have been unreasonably confusing. Many would have gotten it right off and many more would have gotten it later or looked it up. This thing called the internet is used by many show viewers and I would think that if they are confused, they are fully capable of doing a few simple searches to find the answer. It's what I do with Mad Men when I see something odd that I can't figure out.Â 
Â 
They do have a tendency to dumb things down to an extreme extent at times, especially for a show with lots of original source material that can be consulted at any time.Â 


Â 
My wife and several friends are all unsullied, and when they're confused, they just ask me. Â They almost never look stuff up online because they fear spoilers. Â Not all ASOIAF spoilers are properly labeled and hidden.
712	jons nissa	2014-05-18	That's the first thing I thought. A pit just set in my stomach, what are they going to do to that poor little girl.

713	The Lizard King	2014-05-18	Did I misinterpret in the books? I was under the impression that snow Winterfell was life sized. This one had a serious Spinal Tap/Stonehenge problem.


Â
714	Darth Pipes	2014-05-18	Speaking of changes I didn't mind, the fate of Rorge and Biter.Â  It was contrived for them to come out of nowhere and for Rorge to just stand there while Arya killed her.Â  But because of all the changes to the storyline, Brienne never encounters either of them or any of the Bloody Mummers.Â  So it chews some fat off of her storyline.
715	Zman1863	2014-05-18	Kinda funny that The Dreadfort is on the map -- despite no scenes there this week -- and The Eyrie remains off, despite being prominently featured this week, and having previously been an opening credits map location, which would in theory make it easier to add back in than adding a new location from scratch.

We didn't go to Braavos either of course but I don't care because that coin rolling down the slot is dear to me. 


Â 
Yeah I think they haven't been quite as attentive with the map this season. But I guess it saves money not to configure it differently for every episode.Â
716	Northbound2.0	2014-05-18	Those two crazies are going to try and burn Shireen! I'm going to be sick.

722	The Old Tongue	2014-05-18	I started a thread on this but it's awaiting approval: Mel was not wearing her ruby.

727	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-18	I just want to say that I think Mel has the more beautiful breasts of all the naked ladies in GoT (also Ros, but whatever).
728	NOT A TARG I SWEAR	2014-05-18	Brienne and Pod aren't going to the Vale.Â  They're going to find the Brotherhood Without Banners (the last people who had Arya, as far as they know).


I thought Pod had talked about the Hound and Arya likely going to the Eyrie exclaiming Tyrion told him of all the lord marriages and who hates who and that Arya's aunt would be the only place to ransom Arya since they thought she was with the Hound based on Hot Pie's information.

730	Khal Pod	2014-05-18	Speaking of changes I didn't mind, the fate of Rorge and Biter.Â  It was contrived for them to come out of nowhere and for Rorge to just stand there while Arya killed her.Â  But because of all the changes to the storyline, Brienne never encounters either of them or any of the Bloody Mummers.Â  So it chews some fat off of her storyline.


Everyone is breaking my little black heart with their dislike for Brienne's story.Â

733	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-18	Yeahhh...I read all of the books and I don't get why everyone is so upset by the little change in that line. Perhaps I am missing something but "your sister" vs "only Cat". Meh be disappointed if need be but I didn't think it was worth majorly griping about. Still a terrific scene.


Â 
I'm not one who is super upset at missing the 'Only Cat' line (still think it's a better line than 'your sister'), but I can sympathize with those who are.Â  I thought it was awful when they took "I only rescue maidens" and "I dreamed of you" from Jaime to Brienne, and I do have to wonder why they do these things...try and rewrite perfectly wonderful lines?Â 
Â 
Still, it was a terrific episode, everything was well done and we got some pie, too.Â  HOT PIE!!Â  Hot Pie looked like Hot Pie.Â
734	Bannerman_Forrester	2014-05-18	HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT PIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But they couldn't keep one line. Anyway, was I the only one DREADING that Dany was going to say "I'm your Queen and I order you to fuck me"?. Or worst... "I'm Daario Naharis, and I'm here to fuck".I also love Jorah, btw. "Oh, no... my queen got sexed by this asshole" and then, "yay, my Queen listens to me!".

Yea for the most part I have liked their handling of Jaime's storyline, but the "maidens" and "I dreamed of you" lines were sorely missed.Â
738	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-05-18	Massive improvement in Hot Pie's skills. That was definitely wolf bread. Well done Hot Pie.
739	Haunter747	2014-05-18	I actually liked the final scene, was okay with them skipping the only cat lines, my only question is how is LF going to frame someone else for her death now, with no Marillon?
740	The Lizard King	2014-05-18	Â 
I very much wanted to see a whole court reveal of Oberyns choice to defend Tyrion.
Â 
I really wanted to see it during the trial. Something like:
Â 
"And who will you name for your champion?" Cersie looks smug naming the Mountain. Tywin looking vicious Jamie looking concerned.
Â 
Tyrion says nothing. Looking around, semi-panicked.
Â 
"Looks like you are all alone, baby brother." Cersie says. Oberyn rises from his seat.
Â 
"No. Not alone."


Â 
This still my play out this way in two weeks.
741	sj4iy	2014-05-18	Â 
Ummm... they're not going to burn her now. Â You do know what happens in the very last Jon chapter in ADwD, don't you? Â 
Â 
I am really getting worried they will have to burn her to save Jon. Â Honestly, I would rather see Jon die for good if Shireen is the price.


Â 
What if she's the dragon from the 'stone'?

Â 
They can't help but try and rewrite something, can they?Â 
Â 
LOL at Dany and Daario.Â  Yeah, I agree, those lines are supposed to end their encounters, not start them.Â 
Â 
And yes, Jorah was happy, and I was surprised.Â  I'd seen lots of spec that tonight would be the night that he was exiled, I was as pleasantly surprised as Jorah.Â 
Â 
DAMN, I'm gonna miss Oberyn.Â
743	NOT A TARG I SWEAR	2014-05-18	LF should have said "Only Hot Pie"

Â 
Yeah, I admit, I still get riled up at the loss of those lines.Â  I agree, though, Jaime has been fabulous, that's why I miss the extras even more.Â

Bingo.  Brilliant

Yeah, I got the impression they were going to go to the Vale. Pod also said Sansa might be there as well. Makes sense that the sisters would head there - unless you knew Lysa Tully personally  !
Â 
But Brienne did ask Pod if he was completely sure, and of course he said he wasn't. I dunno. I always thought that Brienne should try the Vale in the books, I guess GRRM wanted to show us more of the world and the conditions the smallfolk were going through - but a close relative living in a secluded, very defensible place, seems like a natural destination for Arya and Sansa.
747	Moon And Stars	2014-05-18	"Only Cat" is the kind of stuff that takes a life of its own of forums like this. Â I read the books years ago and only recently learned on this very forum that was an iconic line -- on this forum. Â Never stood out to me otherwise. I wanna say it's really not that serious, but I do sympathize with those who are attached to it. Â But my point remains: I think the line grew into something because of this place and others like it, not because it was that great on its own.

Thisâ<U+0080>¦ I feel a little let down about the moon door scene, they should let Lysa tells us what happenes between littlefinger and her, forced abortion of her child, forced to marry to an old man she did not love etc. that would be much more powerful, now in front of us is just a crazy jealous woman and nothing more

And This.
748	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-18	I actually liked the final scene, was okay with them skipping the only cat lines, my only question is how is LF going to frame someone else for her death now, with no Marillon?


Â 
I have to admit, that does leave me wondering, it comes off much better with Marillon to blame than to count on the Vale Lords believing she fell, on the word of LF and his 'niece.'Â  Still, I wonder if Mord will figure into it, I see him mentioned upthread as reappearing.Â
749	SerHaHa	2014-05-18	Â 
What if she's the dragon from the 'stone'?

Â 
Heh, I'd never considered that either, in all the years of reading the books and following the thousands of theories on thiss bbs and elsewhere.Â  Brilliant - an overused British word, but in this case, "quite" (another Britishy word) accurate.Â 
Â 
Did anyone else cheer when Lysa plummeted screaming to her death.Â  Yay!
750	Colonel Green	2014-05-18	Still, I wonder if Mord will figure into it, I see him mentioned upthread as reappearing.Â 


No, there's no indication Mord is back.
751	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-18	Wow! that kissing scene was very disturbing

Thanks ^^ Â I'd thought about it in the books, but we don't have this scene in the books that so blatantly says that she is needed very much.

754	ipsuel	2014-05-18	As a book purist, even I don't mind the change from 'only Cat' to 'your sister' -- it just doesn't change anything for me. However, if people are saying that D&D did it for the unsullied, well, I think that's really not giving the tv viewers any credit for intelligence.Â 
Â 
They not only re-iterated how much Littlefinger loves 'Sansa's Mom' just a few scenes prior (and god knows we've heard it for 4 seasons straight now)... but come on -- they think TV viewers won't remember who Catelyn STARK was? They think they forgot the woman's name from the Red Wedding? Lol, that's laughable and insulting.Â 
Â 
No. Makes zero sense. If it were some secondary character, sure -- but not Catelyn Stark.Â 
Â 
I think they changed it just to change it -- cuz they can.
Â 
That aside - I liked the episode, Oberyn, Jaime, Sansa and Tyrion mainly. Not tickled with the Wall stuff, but loved all the Tyrion-cell scenes.Â

It wasn't slow-motion, so the slo-mo death is probably going to be Ygritte's at the Wall.
759	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-18	Because if he'd said "Only Cat" this thread would be full of people complaining about how Aiden Gillen's ever-shifting accent fucked up the "Only Cat" delivery and OMG RUINED THE LINE.
Â 

Â 
Sometimes it's best to try and go your own way instead of follow in footsteps that no one will ever give you credit for measuring up to, anyway.
760	HlGHTOWER	2014-05-18	Kinda funny that The Dreadfort is on the map -- despite no scenes there this week -- and The Eyrie remains off, despite being prominently featured this week, and having previously been an opening credits map location, which would in theory make it easier to add back in than adding a new location from scratch.
Â 
We didn't go to Braavos either of course but I don't care because that coin rolling down the slot is dear to me. 


Â 

This bugs the hell out of me every episode. They are really getting lazy with the opening credits map.
761	sj4iy	2014-05-18	I liked the Wall scene, for as little as we got. Â It was interesting to see them flip the lines of Marsh and Jon that way and have Jon advocate for sealing the gate and Thorne saying 'no'. Â It's more character building, really. Â Still, nice to see it.
762	Gwynbleidd	2014-05-18	Daenerys is getting more irritating every scene. Less dragon girl and more Stannis please.Â

I have mixed feelings on the sealing of the Wall because it's diametrically opposed to Jon's later stance as well, but it does make a certain amount of sense at the moment?  The tunnel is the one point where Mance's army can breach the Wall right now and if it's sealed, then Castle Black can hold back the attack for significantly longer.  It's an appropriate solution for this situation where it's not a feasible solution for the situation after Mance's forces are beaten and scattered.
765	Stannis I	2014-05-18	Just came to me that there was no Tywin in this episode... How dare they?
Tywin will soon be killed and they have the audacity of letting him out of an entire episode?

Re: The Wall.. that's exactly what I was thinking -- how will they have him completely flip? And why? And I second your thoughts on Grenn... ugh.
Â 
And you know, I don't mind some of their created scenes -- some are awesome (!) but when you change excellent writing for something that is less-than... I don't get it, and don't respect it.Â
767	Scrambled Aegon	2014-05-18	Both the snow castle and especially the Moon Door bit were way too fast.Â  There was barely an escalating tension (something the writers don't seem to be fond of, really) in the latter.Â  It would be nice if Sansa's plot could get as much screentime as it actually needs, rather than however much the writers have left when they're done writing everything else.

Actually, my post that you replied to started off saying "As a book purist, even I don't mind the change from 'only Cat' to 'your sister' -- it just doesn't change anything for me."Â 
So, nope - sorry, can't accommodate you cuz I'm not pissed. What I said was that the reasons ppl are giving for the change are senseless. The TV viewers aren't 3-year-olds who can't be trusted to retain knowledge. It's silly, lolÂ

Â 
I mean the episode before Robb's death there was no Robb, and we all know how Richard Madden nailed that role...some parts of me wish Madden was cast as Jon Snow and Kit as Robb.
772	Hoo	2014-05-18	I Â really don't understand why Tyrion did not ask Bronn about his betrayal on shipping off Shae. Â They just skipped over that. Â It's a hole in the plot.
773	Moon-Pale Maiden	2014-05-18	So, in reference to the speculation around why Shireen is necessary at the wall - has anyone mentioned yet about Shireen's dream in the prologue of Clash of Kings? Â She tells Maester Cressen that she had a dream that she was eaten by Dragons.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>I had bad dreams,â<U+0080><U+009D> Shireen told him. â<U+0080><U+009C>About the dragons. They were coming to eat me.â<U+0080><U+009D>
The child had been plagued by nightmares as far back as Maester Cressen could recall. â<U+0080><U+009C>We have talked of this before,â<U+0080><U+009D> he said gently. â<U+0080><U+009C>The dragons cannot come to life. They are carved of stone, child."
Â 
Ominous..works with the stone dragon theory too. Â Ugh.. Â too terrible a fate for such a sweet girl. Â I hope she doesn't go that way.
774	Emperoreddy	2014-05-18	I really liked the Arya and Hound scene. Did that happen in the books, him giving a man "mercy"? I don't remember, but it will serve as a nice foreshadowing.

I mean the episode before Robb's death there was no Robb, and we all know how Richard Madden nailed that role...some parts of me wish Madden was cast as Jon Snow and Kit as Robb.


Yeah.
For me it's different, though, since when the red wedding took place in the TV show I hadn't yet read that part in the book, so I didn't notice Robb's absences before it.
Now the feeling is quite different, since I know Tywin will be dead in a few episodes...
I tell you, it's quite a change watching the TV show as an unsullied and as a book reader! LOL
776	Hound's She-wolf	2014-05-18	I Â really don't understand why Tyrion did not ask Bronn about his betrayal on shipping off Shae. Â They just skipped over that. Â It's a hole in the plot.

Â 
Because it didn't matter. Â Whether he put her on a boat and it made a u-turn back to King's Landing, or Cersei/Tywin said 'guard her and you will die here and now, give her to me and you shall be rich beyond your wildest dreams, and given a stout keep.'

782	Obebb	2014-05-18	Yeah he hinted to Tyrion that he could champion him but who was to say if he was being serious. Â He announced and confirmed it during the final trial in front of the whole court.


Hinted? He fully said "I will be your champion"... Jesus guys.
783	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-05-18	Man, Thorne's an even bigger cuntbag in the show. Really like the actor tho, he does a good job and - unlike Slynt - he knows what he's talking about for the most part. Still, can't wait till she gets checked by Jon, along with kissass Slynt.
Â 
All of Tyrion's convos were great, especially the one with Oberyn.

And I lol'd at LF kissing Sansa. I didn't think they'd actually do it in the show.
784	Bronn son of Bronn	2014-05-18	Did I misinterpret in the books? I was under the impression that snow Winterfell was life sized. This one had a serious Spinal Tap/Stonehenge problem.


Â 
lol @ spinaltap
Â 
I had something a bit bigger in my mind, but not sure how Sansa was meant to build a full-size snow Winterfell?!
785	rmholt	2014-05-18	No, there's no indication Mord is back.

"First Builder Sansa Stark, should we seal the gates?"
787	Emperoreddy	2014-05-18	I liked the Dany scene. She is sliding more and more into crusader land and her crazy Targ side shows a bit and Jorah is the moral compass, more then anyone else because trusts him. The scene when he is kicked out should be quote emotional.
788	Whoring Drunkard	2014-05-18	As a book purist, even I don't mind the change from 'only Cat' to 'your sister' -- it just doesn't change anything for me. However, if people are saying that D&D did it for the unsullied, well, I think that's really not giving the tv viewers any credit for intelligence.Â 
Â 
They not only re-iterated how much Littlefinger loves 'Sansa's Mom' just a few scenes prior (and god knows we've heard it for 4 seasons straight now)... but come on -- they think TV viewers won't remember who Catelyn STARK was? They think they forgot the woman's name from the Red Wedding? Lol, that's laughable and insulting.Â 
Â 
No. Makes zero sense. If it were some secondary character, sure -- but not Catelyn Stark.Â 
Â 
I think they changed it just to change it -- cuz they can.
Â 
Â 


For all those upset about the change to "your sister", would it have been better if he said "Only Catelyn"? Â Because I'm not sure she's ever been referred to as "Cat" on the show. Â Casual viewers remember Lady Catelyn Stark. Â They might scratch their heads at "Cat". Â
789	Fat Trell	2014-05-18	That's fucking Gregor. That's the Mountain that Rides. That's a man who strikes so much fear Tywin Lannister chooses his life over an entire kingdom. That's a man who crushes shield walls and splits people in half. Took them three tries, but HBO finally got it perfect.
Â 
Jaime and Tyrion wasn't bad. No complaints.
Â 
Tyrion and Bronn was great. Verbatim from the books is never a bad choice.
Â 
Tyrion and Oberyn was also good. That's how you adapt a scene. Cut out unnecessary fluff and stick to the main plot points.
Â 
The Arya and the HoundÂ scene with the dying man was good untilÂ the beloved beasts of SaltpansÂ showed up.Â Rorge and Biter was very stupid. They are incredibly dangerous people in the books. Rorge is able to fight evenly with Brienne for a time(I think, been awhile). Biter is perhaps the most terrifying thing in the books. These guys come offÂ not as unrepentant psychopathic savages, but as drunken bandits blindly chasing a bounty.Â 
Â 
Also; Arya is on some Wild Bill shit with that draw time. Sheesh
Â 
Once again, even when engaging with incredibly spontaneous sex with an older man, who happens to be an experienced killer, Dany is totally in control. Even when admitting mistakes, Dany never falters.
Â 
Daario's small talk with Jorah in the hall was some soul-crushing stuff man. "She's in a good mood" Cold Daario, cold.
Â 
Second Arya and the Hound scene was good. Would have preferred that discussion on the barely present burns to have taken place in season 1 with a different Stark, but not bad. Their relationship is drifting back into buddy cop territory though.
Â 
Great to see Hotpie again. His actor does a very good job and I loved the wolf-bread.Â 
Â 
Brienne is far too mean for me in the show. She belittles nearly everyone she meets.Â She comes off as more of a snarky, bitter person than someone who is still committed to the ideas of chivalry and honor. Really conflicts with my reading(and the general interpretation) of the character.
Â 
Jon Snow sucks, again. Not surprising. HBO continues to interpret his character as an immature boy who takes any rebuke with sullen tantrums. Very odd change making him support the sealing of the Wall. I do like how Thorne continues to bring up the fact that Jon is a steward though. With actual time between his return and the battle, it makes sense this would have come up.
Â 
Always good to see an Othell Yarwyck shout out.
Â 
Sansa scene was great until Robert shows up. Robert seems pretty genuine in his mistake trying to make a moon door. Sansa has a right to be upset but she seemed only the slightly less childish party here. After that it was all decent, would have preferred "Only Cat" but not a big deal.
790	Tyrion_is_Omar	2014-05-18	Probably has been said before but I do believe that the great theme of the episode are sibiling's relationship, full of love or full of hate:Â 
The mirror of the story that Oberyn told and his pararell with the present: Cersei wanting his brother dead opposite to Jaime protecting him.Â 
Oberyn wanting for years Â to avenge the murder of Â his sister and her children Â opposite to Lysa still hating her dead sister and trying that her niece pay her jealousy towards her sister. Â 
Sandor carrying the mark of his brother hate opposite to Arya carrying the symbol of her broter's love.Â 
I do saw in Sandor/ Arya 's story a foreshadow that what is going to save Arya's soul( sorta) and not to become in Sandor, at the end, is the love of her sibilings. But, maybe is the romantic in me.Â

Did anyone mention that Melisandre is depicted in the bath WITHOUT her customary red ruby choker?
That could be the end of theories that here appearance is a glamour.
Â 
That would be disappointing for me. Â  
Â 
I really liked the theory that she was either hundreds of years old or even a re-animated corpse like Beric.
But the fact that she's talking about her powders and potions and the use of deception in that very scene..
.. well, it looks like they 'hung a lantern' on that one.

Nice short analysis. Very insightful and literate. A+Â
799	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-18	I thought that the Dany andJorah scene was real good. Thought Emilia Clarke acted pretty well during it.
800	Colonel Green	2014-05-18	How difficult would it have been to put Rorge and Biter in Brienne's storyline, where they are supposed to be?


Brienne has no connection to them in the show, whereas Arya does.

I was surprised that they let BjA¶rnsson deliver his only line. Â I always thought that they would dub it, possibly with Rory McCann's voice.

One of the BWB members, I would imagine.
803	DAKINGINDANORF	2014-05-18	I Â really don't understand why Tyrion did not ask Bronn about his betrayal on shipping off Shae. Â They just skipped over that. Â It's a hole in the plot.
What makes you think betrayal?  
After Joff chokes out, Tywin gives the command to close the port and stop all ships, or something along those lines.
804	Gneisenau	2014-05-18	I was hoping for the trial scene where Oberyn declares himself as the champion.
Â 
Also Sansa should consider entering in one of those sand castle building competitions.
805	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-18	Â 
It wasn't slow-motion, so the slo-mo death is probably going to be Ygritte's at the Wall.


Cleary the slow-mo will be on Tywin so we can see him shit himself and realize it's not gold unless D&D decide to have Tyrion break the fourth wall or just deadpan "In the end he didn't shit gold" to himself in some insane fit of glee.Â

Â 
Â 
Very good call, as has been noted. Â Arya's memories of her past, including her love for Jon and Robb and their younger siblings, is one of the few things keeping her from giving herself completely to the dark side. Â 
Â 
Not sure how I feel about TV-Arya being so kind to TV-Sandor; but it works in the TV version. Â Â 
Â 
Oberyn & Tyrion scene - the best in the episode. Â Tyrion's struggle to stop crying, especially when Oberyn finally offers him hope and those tears want to fall, was especially well acted. Â He's so tired of being seen first as a dwarf. Â And Oberyn shows that he doesn't see Tyrion first as a dwarf, he sees Tyrion as an individual; a Lannister but not a monstrous Imp. Â Both actors brought this scene to life brilliantly.
807	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-18	Cleary the slow-mo will be on Tywin so we can see him shit himself and realize it's not gold unless D&D decide to have Tyrion break the fourth wall or just deadpan "In the end he didn't shit gold" to himself in some insane fit of glee.Â  


Â 
Nah, Tywin falls over dead, and the camera cuts to the contents of the chamber pot, and we see no gold, just ordinary shit. 
Â 
Just need to have some random mook say "I hear Tywin Lannister shits gold" at the start of the episode and we're set.
808	GallowsKnight	2014-05-18	Please tell me that little bite doesn't kill the hound.


Human bites are nasty. The human mouth is full of lots of bacteria. I'm an doctor and we routinely give the strongest oral antibiotics (sometimes even IV) for human bites that pierce the skin and draw blood (which this one did), even if it's just a piddly one from a toddler.
Â 
Where the hound was bit was pretty nasty too. On an arm or a leg the infection could be more localised, but the neck, it's going to spread.

Haha I just want to hear that deadpan so bad. In all seriousness it's probably Ygritte's death, or maybe an adapted Grenn-either would have an affect on Jon but instead of just finding her I'm sure they'll make him actually see her fall as Legolas Jr. snipes her down with the revenge-kill.
810	Emperoreddy	2014-05-18	So does Oberyn's speech put to bed the "They whitewashed Cersei" talk from a few weeks ago? Complete confirmation she was using real emotions for devious means, and just wanted to get the judges to kill Tyrion.

Also the wound is probably going to left largely untreated.
812	DAKINGINDANORF	2014-05-18	I have a feeling that if we do in fact get LS, that we won't see Arya/Nymeria pulling her corpse out of the river.  There's been zero buildup iirc of any of the other Starks having warg capability in the show, which is disappointing.  But perhaps D&D know that nothing ever comes of those subplots (a greater disappointment if true) and subtracts their inclusions.  My guess is when she is revealed in the final scene (better be), Thoros will probably rattle off a few lines about them pulling her out and Dondarion giving her the ol' red god CPR session.  Hope I'm wrong!
813	chicagostatecougars	2014-05-18	I was really disappointed with the snow castle scene. Â I was hoping it would be more emotional for Sansa. Â I have been reading comments by "unsullied" tv-show fans and no one seems to care about that scene. 


Â 
I agree. This is one of the best and most powerful scenes in the books. And it wasn't done justice. But neither was the scene with Cersei and Jaime in the sept. Â Unsullied don't know what they're missing out on. Â TV is nowhere as good as the real thing.
814	Mark Antony	2014-05-18	I'm so fucking excited for Oberyn/Mountain but at the same time dreading it cause Pedro is the man
815	Emperoreddy	2014-05-18	Also the wound is probably going to left largely untreated.


Â 
It was, he sowed it up and Arya "washed it" but its not like her washing was very septic. His refusing to burn it pretty much solidifies that. That is going to fester.
816	Grail King	2014-05-18	I wonder will Sansa piece together Lysa's " I lied for you, I killed for you " with Petyr's - what do we do to the ones who hurt the ones we love line and his creeping kiss.
Â 
I do think in this instence she'll back his statement up on Lysa slipping or what ever, but she ( hopefully ) uses her knowledge to ICE him.
Â 
Don't know what to make of no Giant Doll in the Winterfell scene.
817	HouseHarrison	2014-05-18	Yeah pretty dumb the Hound is going to be done in by a little bite. Vargo Hoat had the same thing, but you can't compare The Hound to The Goat.
818	Emperoreddy	2014-05-18	I'm so fucking excited for Oberyn/Mountain but at the same time dreading it cause Pedro is the man


Â 
God that is going to rip my heart out. Have developed a man crush on Pedro.
819	lostinwesteros	2014-05-18	The actor playing Littlefinger is so good at being a perv. Â  Â Â  Wasn't bothered by the change from "Only Cat" to "Your sister". Â 
Â 
I just love Tyrion, loved his scenes with Jaime and with Oberyn. Â 
Â 
Really great seeing Hotpie again. That direwolf bread was truly magnificent.
Â 
Made me sad to see the beginning of the end for Sandor.
Â 
I see Dany has some new threads. Â Wonder why Jorah didn't get any (new threads, that is . . . )
Â 
Pretty scary with the two sicko's, Mel and Selyse, about to make off with Shireen. Â
820	Fragile Bird	2014-05-18	I wonder how LF is going to explain what happened to Lysa without Marillion in the plot?Â  And no one else in the scene except Sansa and Petyr.
Â 
I disliked the Hound thinking about food and Arya being the one thinking about soldiers being ahead.Â  Arya is the heedless one, not Sandor.
Â 
For those who wondered about Brienne and the Eyrie, she did think about going there in the books, but with snow in the Eyrie and the mountain clansmen having become better armed (by Tyrion, to harass Lysa's people) Brienne had decided not to go there.Â  Are we going to see a major plot change again?
Â 
I'm glad they brought in the speech about Cersei showing off baby Tyrion and twisting his little weenie that got skipped over from the book scene between Oberyn and Tyrion at the welcome to King's Landing.
Â 
While it was disappointing to have Tyrion missing in this episode, it's also too bad Varys wasn't there either, since presumably he will soon disappear for a very long stretch.
Â 
I also thought the Sansa-Lysa-Petyr scenes were pushed along too quickly.Â  And Robin isn't sickly enough. Â  But he was whinny and snivelling enough.
Â 
Oh, one more thing.Â  I thought that book Selyse did not care at all about what was going on between Mel and Stannis, since it was all For The Greater Good.Â  The idea of her showing even an iota of jealousy is weird.Â  And count me in as one who fears for Shireen now.
821	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-18	Just noticed on re-watch that some (not all) of Ser Gregor's work with the two-handed sword was done with only one hand.
Â 
Hooray!
822	Ser Creighton	2014-05-18	I liked the Dany scene. She is sliding more and more into crusader land and her crazy Targ side shows a bit and Jorah is the moral compass, more then anyone else because trusts him. The scene when he is kicked out should be quote emotional.

You think Jorah is the moral compass? That's interesting. Did you actually listen to what Jorah said? I am sure you heard it but did you listen. Jorah has his history even on the show. Jorah thinks selling slaves is ok, he has made excuses for it. He is indignant about what Ned Stark did. Slavery is one of those things that is not really grey, it's pretty black and white. Buy the Unsullied, sell slaves, it's all good if it gets him what he wants. Betray his lord, Betray his father, betray Viserys, betray Dany. Which I think this is the setup for. Jorah wants Dany and now Darrio is in the way. This will probably lead to the falling out. But a moral compass? How so?
We know from the books that Jorah got some first hand and much needed lessons in slavery and he didn't like it. In fact he seems pretty pro kill the shit out of the slavers these days. He knows he has been an idiot, that he has a problem admitting his mistakes and tends to blame everyone else. It's his wife's fault, Neds fault, the slaves fault, it is always someone else. Well at least pre get the boot Jorah. But a Moral compass? People with a moral compass do not buy and sell slaves and betray everyone around them. Jorah wanted easy money to continue to try and buy his wife's love, so he sold some poachers got busted and refused to admit what he did was wrong or take responsibility for his actions. Just like he couldn't except that selling secrets about Dany was Betraying her. I like the character but he has his issues, like the rest of them, probably why I like him. Though I guess it depends on your compass, I am sure some people think kidnapping 300 girls is morally ok or they would of never done it. And when someone puts a bullet in the kidnappers heads I am going to feel totally fine about it, I am quirky like that. To be clear I don't think you think slavery is ok, just using a real world example of something most people are rather heavily offended by. You know someone could argue maybe it's like Disney land for the 276 girls still abducted. I am more of the mind they probably would rather go home, seems the more logical thought than happy slaves who like being kidnapped, and god knows what else.
823	Fragile Bird	2014-05-19	The thought that Ser Gregor would use a real sword at practice without wearing armour is ludicrous.Â  Accidents do happen...Â  I guess they needed their quota of nudity.Â  And why do we get full frontals of women in the series but never of the men, just asses (although some have been very fine asses.Â  But...)
824	greensleeves	2014-05-19	I liked (but not loved) pretty much everything in this episode. Â The Snow Castle/'Only Cat' scenes weren't as good as in the book, but I wasn't expecting them to be. Â I liked Tyrion and Dany's scenes. Â Rory McCann's acting has really improved this season; the actor I saw in seasons 1-3 would never have been able to pull off that soliloquy. Â 
Â 
Random Thoughts:
Â 
- Hot Pie Cameo!
Â 
- Lysa's line about the "blue eyes" of the dead... hmmm....
Â 
- There were no naked, nameless whores! Â Good job show! Â Mel's nudity was still gratuitous (way less plot-relevant and way more extended than Daario's), but at least she's a character that's more than a sexual object.
825	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-19	I wonder how LF is going to explain what happened to Lysa without Marillion in the plot?Â  And no one else in the scene except Sansa and Petyr.


This. I didn't mind the "Only Cat" substitution at all since, while it's a great line, the adaptation was still otherwise great. But yeah, no clue how they're going to have him explain that. Unless they somehow blame Robin and accelerate my namesake Â 
Â

Â 
Â 


Â 
Â 
Saltpans and Maidenpool are both on the way there. I think it's pretty likely that D&D substitute Rorge/Biter with the BWB or random hooligans since Gwendoline Christie (SP?) confirmed in an interview earlier this year she bites someone's ear off. It's likely to be the BWB so they fight and then her and Pod are captured, thus (hopefully) ensuring LS to end the season.Â

I caught that as well; still have absolutely no idea what to make of it beyond the obvious. Was just such a weird line anyways-how the hell would she have seen the bodies? She never leaves the Eyrie!

Yiss. I kinda like him actually.Â 
Â 
I was ok with Mel bearing all because, she really was bearing all. Literally and metaphorically. Selyse felt enraptured because Mel is so awesome to her, but also envious and Mel picks up on that. That whole scene was two women laying bear a great deal. Selyse all but admits she felt a twinge of something when Mel and Stannis got bizzay. She kept telling herself it was for the greater good and for R'hllor and there was no sin involved. But she feels inadequate and Mel tries in her bizarre way, to comfort Selyse and ease her worries by telling her even she can have power if she just looks into the flames. Its almost touching. Until theres the foreboding about Shireen...

I think there could have been a certain poetry to Brienne "avenging" Arya without even knowing it. Plus, as they've made it, they're not letting Brienne act as a "true knight," defending the common folk from rapers and raiders, which I think is a huge oversight.

Just word around the water cooler atm, don't know for sure.
835	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-19	Random impressions:
Â 
- Mel is fine as hell, sweet R'hllor have mercy on my soul. If Dany accepts the Lord of Light too I might have to start worshiping that bastard myself
Â 
- Ramsay and Theon are in better shape than Daario. There, I said it. The dude has been going to the same gym as Grey Worm
Â 
- I randomly pictured Littlefinger slipping and rolling down those ice-crusted stairs on the yard
Â 
- Robin was surprisingly (and relatively) nice until they started to argue
Â 
- Everything Tyrion was just aces. I'm so going to miss Oberyn. Damn Martin, why you had to kill him just for a bit of shock value and trope reversal?
Â 
- Hotpie cameo! Happy day, now that he mastered the direwolf I'd like an order of Tyrell Rose Cookies, thank you

More like so Tyrion's story could progress, lol. What would happen if he won the trial? Run off and live a peaceful life in Dorne?

Â 
No, run off and plot alongside Arianne, Doran, the Sand Snakes and a living Oberyn Â . I for one would have liked that better than his travelogue, but maybe his arc in Essos is going to be a good one in the next book
841	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-19	they had the perfect chance for tyrion to talk about tysha, but they didnt have him bring her up. "i sould have never believed that a whore could love me." he should have said. , "i should have learned my lesson the first time"
im starting to think that they are dropping that whole thing.
also, fucking sansa!. that whole segment of th show was amazing. i'll even forgive the "your sister" because it was so good. the stark theme as she walsk out... so many feels. that kiss. ugh. poor sophie. must have been pretty awkward to film.

844	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-19	Mel's nudity was still gratuitous (way less plot-relevant and way more extended than Daario's), but at least she's a character that's more than a sexual object.I don't think it was so gratuitous. It was very subtle way to say "your husband hit this because I'm hot, I tell jokes and bring me my beauty creams, Queenie".
845	Rockroi	2014-05-19	Huge, huge huge rebound episode after several weeks of listless meandering.Â 
Â 
What I liked:
Â 
Brotherly Love: Tyrion and Jaime, once again, show the dimensions of their love and affection, as endlessly complicated as it is.Â  Jaime wants to be there for his brother, but cannot be and it pains Tyrion so much when Jaime â<U+0080><U+0093> in effect- admits that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not the man he used to be.Â  And while Tyrion tries to mask it in humor and subtlety, he ultimately must admit something very scary: his big brother will not be there to protect him.Â  The layers of both pain and sadness in that scene was huge: as Tyrion must â<U+0080><U+0093> in some ways for the last time â<U+0080><U+0093> â<U+0080><U+009C>grow upâ<U+0080><U+009D> and dissuade himself of the notion that Jaime wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be there to protect him.Â 
Â 
But more than that: Jaime CANNOT be there for him and he must admit that fact to Tyrion, and in doing that, Jaime is prevented from protecting the one person he has wanted to protect his entire life.Â 
Â 
The depths and dimension of that love was shone brightly in that one scene.
Â 
Brotherly Hate: Conversely, the Houndâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scene was honest and tight; the horror to Sandor was not being fried, but the fact that his own brother did it; the one person he had always hoped would protect him.Â  And making it worse, the fact that his own father hid it away.Â  The sense of loneliness and of isolation is more appreciable than I thought possible.Â  Â 
Â 
Sex, Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a Good Thing: I like that Dany had Sex, that she seemed to like it and that the Universe did not end.Â  I always found the needless avoidance of sex between people attracted to one another to be a monumental waste of time.Â  I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care about stupid oaths and I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care if you feel like you shouldn't be fucking the hot sell-sword.Â  Sex is not evil.Â  I liked how Dany had sex with the guy who she wanted to have sex with and that he wanted to have sex wit hher and the world did not end.Â 
Â 
Friendship: IN the books, Bronnâ<U+0080><U+0099>s exit from Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s life is, in effect, a bland and blatant attempt to make Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s life seem shitty.Â  And in the book, it works.Â  But in the books, the scene is done entirely from Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s POV; the story never even HINTS on how the maneuver affected Bronn or how Bronn felt or if Bronn had any regrets or misgivings about it.Â  The story isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t about Bronn, after all.Â  But the show did Bronn a kindness and gave him the parting we knew could be there: that Bronn had good reasons for not fighting AND he had regrets for not doing what he was not doing.Â  Bronnâ<U+0080><U+0099>s farewell from Tyrin was whole- far more whole- and thus far more complicated than it was in the book.Â  IT was, in so many ways, more â<U+0080><U+009C>bookâ<U+0080><U+009D> than the books.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â 
Â 
Which leads to this:
Â 
Shut up all you people that hate book-people for fairly criticizing the show; Jesus Christ not ever single criticism of the Show is somehow a statement that the books are perfect or that everything must be 100% done in line with the books and THATâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what we â<U+0080><U+009C>puristsâ<U+0080><U+009D> donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t like.Â  No.Â  Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bullshit.Â  No- when we criticize the show, he hereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a fucking novel idea â<U+0080><U+0093> itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s because sometimes the show is lazu, misses the point, does stupid shit or is just plain-â<U+0080>ol â<U+0080>not very good.â<U+0080><U+0099>Â  I know, I know, theÂ Hersey.Â  But seriously- I JUST NAMED FOUR SCENES THAT THE SHOW DID BETTER THAN THE BOOKS!!!Â  So enough with the knee-jerk reaction to sensible, reasonable criticism of theÂ show, for the love of Christ.Â  Covered it in the bold faced section.Â 
Â 
Sansa and the Lunatic She Lives With: Spot. On.Â  Once again, I felt that the show crystallized the impossibility of Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s universe: sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a pawn, a sex-object, a child, a token.Â  And the actress and the story have shown that to the letter.Â 
Â 
What I am Not Sold On:
Â 
Soâ<U+0080>¦ we â<U+0080>¦ Doing anything or Are You Just Taking a Bath, Tits McGee? :Â  Okay, so, no bath it was.Â  Look, I know they need to do stuff and stuff, and we got some good info that they will be leaving Dragonstone, but â<U+0080>¦ what was the point?Â  Did we need to see Melâ<U+0080><U+0099>s boobs more (and after almost 4 years of the show, that may be the actual answer).Â  Why were we there and why are we listening to them?Â  Stannis?Â  Why not a scene with him?Â  OR any in a long line of characters anybody givesÂ  shit about?Â  Did we really need to know where Mel keeps her poison (perilously close to the stuff that makes her tingly in the tub, apparently)>Â  I just found the whole scene to be a waste.Â 
Â 
What I did Not Like:
Â 
I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have any major complaints with this episode.Â 
Â 
This was the best episode since Jaime Joff was killed and itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not close. Â
846	Nami	2014-05-19	God this episode was so shit I can't even begin explaining
847	Konradsmith	2014-05-19	It's not gratuitousÂ for someone to be naked in theÂ bath. I think it was an interesting choice to show the sister-wife dynamic between Stan's two queens, while the Dragonstone boys are off dealing with bankers.
Â 
Once again Carice/Mel's utter confidence in situations where some people wouldÂ feel ashamed or vulnerable is an effectiveÂ demonstration of her power andÂ  her dominance. And the only time that the camera ogled her rather than just showing her matter-of-factly, was a POV shot from a woman's perspective.
Â 
I will have commentary on things beyond this scene later on.

Someone mentioned it already but the point, which was made clearer with some excellent camera direction, is that Selyse had some serious misgivings about Mel and Stannis getting it on and is jealous of Mel's physical appearance. She also is completely devoted to Mel and their Lord and understands that it is all for their "greater good". In its own truly weird way it's an excellent scene to show Selyse hashing it out and Mel trying to comfort her in a peculiar but extremely effective way. She's naked obviously so Selyse can see her body and know that she doesn't exactly match up.
Â 
Plus calling the seen a waste isn't close to being true. Even if you didn't like the nudity it established that they're all getting out of there, including Shireen whom apparently the Lord "has a plan for". What that means is yet to be seen and we can all speculate heavily on it, but the blatantly obvious reason that they're getting Shireen out (Note: not the same as the Lord's plan for her, to be clear) is because Mel probably sees that Dragonstone is going to be taken by the Lannisters/Loras soon.

851	Chloe.a.thomson	2014-05-19	I'm not too bothered about changing "Only Cat". They kept the snow castle and added a Robin bitch slap. CAnt complain.
I was hoping they would keep the kiss... However it felt a bit grosser than I had imagined. Still glad it was ther though.
Loved the Tyrion/Oberyn scene, I got goosebumps when Oberyn was telling that story.
852	madprofessah	2014-05-19	Just came to me that there was no Tywin in this episode... How dare they?
Tywin will soon be killed and they have the audacity of letting him out of an entire episode?
I can't think of a world without TV show Tywin Lannister... Charles Dance is way better than book Tywin...


Â 
Agreed!
Â 
It's hard to believe there's only three episodes left and we have so many big moments left from ASOS to get through:
Â 
1) Death of Tywin by Tyrion; Shae's ultimate betrayal and timely end!
2) Escape of Tyrion with an assist from Varys
3) Oberyn losing the Trial By Combat with the Mountain, but Mountain succumbing as well (am I remembering this right from the books that both of them die??)
4) unCat!
5) Attack on the Wall / Stannis arrival / Stannis temps Jon with Winterfell / Jon elected Lord Commander of NightWatch
Â 
Anything I missed? How do you think D&D will change things from the Books? (Note none of these pivotal events involve Dany at all, so I suspect some of her ADWD story will show up before the end of this season. Also, will they give us Bran's 3-eyed crow?)

Â 
I guess we'll see Arya leaving the Hound and going to Braavos. Maybe they'll unambiguously kill the Hound in the show
Â 
Also, we'll see Leaf and Bloodraven, most likely in episode 10
Â 
And (this is my own speculation) I think the season will end with UnCat hanging Brienne and Pod

I hope they cut Lady Stokeworth. It is easily one of the worst elements of the series, and the show would be significantly better without it. But I know she has hinted at the character in the show so she will probably be there.
857	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-19	3) Oberyn losing the Trial By Combat with the Mountain, but Mountain succumbing as well (am I remembering this right from the books that both of them die??)He dies in Feast.

858	Beastmode2Raiders	2014-05-19	I don't post very much, I just read stuff here, but is it me or has the show gone from bad to worse?
1. The MountainÂ  - I don't want to be rude, but this new one (and the one before) is beyond BS...
2. Jon wanting to SEAL the gate... What? Are they just reversing the books?
3. Dany ordering the sellswords to take Yunkai. How can a single company take a city? I'm not sure that even Bittersteel's boys could do that. And besides wasn't Dany all about peace with Yunks in the books?
4. NO ONLY CAT! I'm out of words...

Im actually ok with her being off screen. I explained her to my mum and she also seemed glad she was off screen. Wise decision for the show to do so.Â

I actually could not disagree more, I loved the Stokeworths in the books. Mama Stokeworths trying to marry Lollys off by peddling goose, Lollys not realising that Shae was a fraud, little baby Tyrion, and finally the epic cock up with Bron. 
I hope the show keeps at least some of these elements.
865	Le Cygne	2014-05-19	And why do we get full frontals of women in the series but never of the men, just asses (although some have been very fine asses.Â  But...)Agreed...

Really?? 
If we accept that it'll never be as good as the books (which seems to be the case with every book adaptation) then cannot we just enjoy the ride?
I know everyone will have a different opinion, but I am just so grateful that I am able to see ANY ASOIAF adaption in my lifetime. I also think they have done a fine job.
Will it rival the books in my heart? Of course not. But it'll allow me to share the ASOIAF world with friends/family who never would have known about it otherwise.

Why does it even matter? The meaning's the same. It's still getting the point across and it's still a great punchline.Â
883	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-05-19	I really enjoyed Bronn's interaction with Tyrion in the cell after watching the episode. You could tell Bronn wanted to help Tyrion but he just couldn't put his well being on the line to the extent it'd require.
884	Rill Redthorn	2014-05-19	The thing with Shireen being "important" (or essential or whatever) to Mel bugged me too. Â 
Â 
I wonder if maybe they're going to use the threat to Shireen in place of the threat to Mance's infant son up at the wall to give Jon some of that character development from the books. Maybe Mel tries to burn Shireen and Jon stops her by hiding Shireen elsewhere on the Wall. We haven't heard a thing about Mance's spearwife or child and I don't think we're going to -- hell, we've hardly seen Mance himself! -- so I think if the show wants to do the "Mel would happily burn an innocent child at the stake for the sake of the power of king's blood" plot development, Shireen would be the obvious choice, and then Jon could save her with some variant on the trick he used to save Mance's child, perhaps.Â

885	clawson24	2014-05-19	Excellent episode, in my opinion.Â 
Â 
Best parts:
Â 
- Selyse and Melisandre dialogue. It seems Shireen will have a role to play in the future;
- Tyrion and Bronn dialogue;
- Tyrion and Oberyn speaking about how they met. Pity they didn't put the whole dialogue, when Oberyn tells Tyrion how he believes Tywin murdered Elia and her children to 'pay a debt', since Aerys chose Elia instead of Cersei to marry Rhaegar;
- Robin being Joffrey (I'll make those who bother me fly);
- Lysa Arryn flying (she was bothering me, so...).
Â 
Not so good:
Â 
- Dario Naharys. I don't think this Dario is as cocky as the other one. He just seems nice;
- New Mountain, who doesn't ride (or act, for all I can tell).
Â 
And, by the description of the next episodes on IMDB, I'd say Stannis is not going to reach the wall this season (Mance Rayder isn't in any of the previews so far), but we definetely will have Hazzea!


Â 
I'd stay Stannis arriving this season is 99.9999999% confirmed.

We haven't heard a thing about Mance's spearwife or child and I don't think we're going to -- hell, we've hardly seen Mance himself! -- so I think if the show wants to do the "Mel would happily burn an innocent child at the stake for the sake of the power of king's blood" plot development, Shireen would be the obvious choice, and then Jon could save her with some variant on the trick he used to save Mance's child, perhaps.Â 


I am really surprised we didn't get Mance's baby/Val. I though for sure once Gilly's baby was included, that storyline was a go.
I did think to save time we may just have seen Mance with the baby pre-battle, with Dalla having already died.
888	VladimirDulud	2014-05-19	OMG please by the old gods and the new, the seven, the lord of light, the drowned god, and the red god please D&D with all of the dumb changes you have made to this adaptation please let Oberyn live... I don't give a fuck if you and GRRM have to change the rest of the storyline to accommodate this change...Â 


Â 
Would that this could be true. I know there have been other instances where some characters who've died in the books, have lived on the show, or vice versa -- mayhaps. Mayhaps...
889	IamMe90	2014-05-19	"your sister." NO. NO THAT IS NOT OKAY, THAT IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR "only Cat." ugh
890	T.C	2014-05-19	Great episode!
Â 
- TV Cersei appears to be less squemish than Book Cersei, walking through those corpses without even flinching
Â 
- Seems they are softening up Arya and The hounds departure..Which i kinda like, i don't like how she ditched him in the book
Â 
- Loved how Oberyn bought up the molestation scene. I thought they might leave it out for more Cersei whitewashing..Also glad Oberyn brings up that Cersei was trying to manipulate him the other episode
Â 
- Loved the changes they made of Sansa slapping Robin. I also thought they might not go through with the kiss scene due to Sophie only JUST being an adult but i'm glad they did.
Â 
-Goodbye Lysa! Crazy bitch!
891	binga	2014-05-19	Even though this episodeÂ was mostly a faithful adaptation almost everything about it felt wrong. They have decided to completely abandon subtlety or any form of controlled storytelling. The little nuances matter. Dany and Daario made no sense here, it was this silly male stripper moment of a guy who lets face it is not actually Daario. He is just some good looking dude. The Sansa Littlefinger moment was completely botched, why does everything have to be so stripped of emotion? The only parts that I truly enjoyed were Tyrion and Arya scenes which actually did involve emotion and real interactions between characters.
892	Conchobar	2014-05-19	Is this the actor who played the dying man Arya spoke with?

893	Hoo	2014-05-19	The thing with Shireen is, Stannis has always been protective of her. Â In the previous episode he ordered his wife not to physically abuse her. Â Now Melisandre appears to be placing her in harm's way, and tells the wife about it. Â The wife has a decision to make, tell Stannis or not? Â And Stannis will have a decision to make. Â Daughter, Lord of Light and chance to rule, Melisandre? Â I hope he kills Melisandre.

894	Chloe.a.thomson	2014-05-19	For those whining about and berating those who are whining about the "Your sister" revision: Tom Stoppard in his play The Real Inspector Hound exposes the hackery of some writers who haven't the creative resources to include expository information without simply announcing it in the most cringe-worthy and ridiculously obvious way. D and D apparently haven't come across Stoppard (their humorless interviews seem to confirm this). Let me see if I can explain why changing "Only Cat" might matter to some:
1. Baelish grew up with Catelyn and Lysa. They've shared quite a few life-altering experiences. Call me strange, but it just seems ridiculous that a middle-aged man would refer to his unrequited love to her freakin' sister as "your sister." Just as a generic plot/character device, well, refer back to Stoppard. Even given the possibility of cynically worrying that viewers--who have now had three seasons' worth of episodes to put on their memory caps--might not know who "Cat" is, maybe that's the consequence of trying to jam too much content into 50 minutes of space. Maybe if they would allow their scenes (and therefore characters) a little bit more space to breathe, they wouldn't feel compelled to make such inane editorial choices.
Let me put it this way: the edit was so stupid that it made me pause and think about how stupid it was, thereby destroying the whole dramatic effect of the climax. Now that's what a hack edit will do.
2. I'd argue there's dramatic punch to "Cat"--a punch that is lost by "Your sister." By saying "Cat," Baelish is throwing the intimacy he has had with "your sister" right in Lysa's face. He's also implying more than just a fraternal intimacy. It's what makes Baelish such a nasty piece of work: he's not just sending her to a horrific death, he's sending her there with the knowledge that he loved "your sister" AND that he had long since earned the right to call her "Cat." It's twisting the knife before she even knew it was in her. Pity the producers didn't give us Lysa's revelation of hearing "that" word, but, the HBO clock of doom ("must not go beyond 50 minutes...") was clanging, so...see Stoppard and hackery explanation above.
Look, I'm not going to make the argument that Martin is The Bard, but he is damn clever with dialogue and shows nice depth of characterization. It makes for good writing, good enough to make this humble reader read a genre he wouldn't normally be caught dead glancing at. Is it too much to ask the producers and the bean-counters at HBO not to muck up the good bits? My Seven Gods, the fact that so many readers remember the line should be at least be a hint of the potency of it.
And props to HouseHarrison and the link, which perfectly illustrates Stoppard's Theory of Expository Hackery

Whilst the change didn't bother me that much, I found this post almost changed my mind.Â

Â 


I don't buy that argument. Â The same argument can be made if one wants to nitpick Cersei calling Jaime the Lord Commander, instead of Jaime or brother. Â It's just book readers clawing for straws.
897	clawson24	2014-05-19	The insane and unrealistic expectations of some people here are quite comical. Worst acting yet on the series? Unwatchable? If you don't like the changes they're making to the source material then by all means don't watch, but both of those statements are insane.
Â 
Tyrion/Oberyn was terrific. Tears in both of their eyes as Tyrion contemplated the depth of his family's deep-seated hatred of him while Oberyn is tender one moment and bad-ass the next. Perfect. Oberyn was such inspired casting.
Â 
So what if the Mountain doesn't seem to be the most promising actor ever (which is a large conclusion based on one line)? He's a one-dimensional character anyway, made special solely by his size and how evil he is. He will have a handful more lines at most in the remainder of the series, so the guy doesn't need to be Laurence Olivier. He's suitably huge and suitably formidable.
Â 
"Only Cat" would've been cool but absolutely nothing was lost in meaning with the way they did it. 99+% of the viewership has absolutely zero attachment to that particular line so it's utterly unimportant in the grand scheme of the show. All of the Eyrie scenes could've benefitted from more time for sure but they worked just fine regardless.
Â 
One of the three best eps of the season so far, imo.

898	ground_control	2014-05-19	Mellisandre and Sylese -- that was awkward. Â I'm not sure if I'm disappointed or relieved that that didn't end up as a sex scene. Â Although I'm leaning towards disappointed -- not because it would be "hot", but because it wouldn't be. Â Neither Stannis nor Seylese are described as attractive in the books, and their relationship is frequently described as "dutiful", so (given that the show already upsexed Stannis+Mel), I think showing Selyse+Mel would have been an interesting twist. Â At least more interesting than *just* showing Me's boobs and making an eerie foreshadowing of Shireen's importance when the obvious answer to "Why bring Shireen?" is "because everybody else is going and it would be stupid to leave the King's daughter as an easy-to-pick-up hostage".
899	Envie	2014-05-19	I'm really surprised how critical some are being in this episode's feedback... stunned really. I thought the episode was phenomenal. Easily one of the best this season really... Â The depth of emotion in nearly all of the actors (except maybe Gregor Clegane and who cares, he's just a giant evil guy with a giant sword) - pretty much all were spot on perfect.
Â 
Oberyn / Tyrion scene blew me away... I cried like a baby. I cried for baby Tyrion who knew nothing but torment his whole life from Cersei and pretty much everyone except his brother who protected him. I cried for Elia and her children and the horrific way they died. I cried for Oberyn - because his vengeance is so lost and wasted.  Â ... The look of hope in Tyrion's eyes at that moment when Oberyn said he would be his champion. I cried for that lost hope.
Â 
Every other scene was awesome too - even the weird Mel / Selyse scene. I liked the "Only Cat" scene even without the trademark two words being said - who cares, the moment was still very intense and well done.
Â 
This whole episode seemed to be about relationships between two people who were somewhat adversary yet partnered by fate ... did anyone notice that?Â 
Â 
LOVED IT.
Â 
I even loved Littlefinger, funny batman villain voice and all. I love him!
900	Maria26	2014-05-19	I'm so pissed that they didn't show the Daario/Dany sex -.-Â  I mean the guy stripped and then go out of Dany's quarters the next morning and we are suppposed to believe that they had sex? Ugh!
Â 
Crazy Lysa is finally gone and I can't say that she'll be missed.
Â 
Best scene? Oberyn and Tyrion which made the all episode for me. Jorah and Dany scene was very great and Ian/Emilia have the kind of chemistry that's lighting in a botlle.
Â 
If they touch baby Shireen, I'll go all mother of dragons on them. I believe either Stannis or Devos will be there to save her and she might go to the wall with her father.
901	acejack	2014-05-19	I loved Cersei watching The Mountain brutalizing the commoners then she just steps right over their entrails with her sexy ass walk.
Arya and The Hound should have a Broadway spinoff. Glad she got to cross Rorge off her little list as fast as she added it.
Tyrion and Bronn were great. I didn't hear anything about Lollys being gang raped behind a tanner's shop so I guess lil' Tyrion Stokeworth will be Bronn's own whelp.
I like that Daenerys is into CFNM. Ser Friendzone does not approve. Is that a raven I hear?
I like that Melisandre is into exhibitionism. I don't like that she wants to burn little Shireen Baratheon. I don't think Stannis will either.
The Hound should pick up some Bactine at the next map store they find.
Brienne is hot this season. Apparently blonde hair and black armor works for me.
HOT PIE!
Glad they put back the story about Cersei pinching Tyrion's baby bits. She really is the evil cunt to end all evil cunts.
I really hope at some point they mention that Prince Oberyn's nickname is "The Red Viper".
Sansa is really good at building snow castles. You Northerners and your summer snows.

902	Widows_Blood	2014-05-19	I think i'm at the point where i'm done with this forum. At least the show part of it. The amount of constant pessimism and whining just saps any excitement I can muster for this show. There are so many better places to discuss the show. Not even worth it.Â
903	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-19	it's like they're think the Unsullied wouldn't remember Cat as Cat so they changed the entire line. I'm very disappointed.

You really think the writers of the most watched HBO show of all time deliberately changed a line to give the middle finger to a bunch of obsessed nerds online?
It's because no one in show refers to her as Cat.
904	Night's_King	2014-05-19	Huh, this is really hard for me. They changed so much and there were so many things wrong with this episode, but I still liked it. Can't really say why. Maybe because I laughed so hard at "Call me Petyr!"

Agreed.
Â 
I lurked the forums for a while... finally made an account... and then lurked a while more before posting my first post last week.
The negativity about what was (IMO) a great run of episodes made me want to contribute and add my two cents.
906	Cersei the Great	2014-05-19	Great they kept the story about oberyns visit to casterly rock.

I agree.  Was glad to see they included it.
907	Chloe.a.thomson	2014-05-19	I don't buy that argument. Â The same argument can be made if one wants to nitpick Cersei calling Jaime the Lord Commander, instead of Jaime or brother. Â It's just book readers clawing for straws.


I get what you are saying, and I do not think the change is that big of a deal.
Â 
However since I had never really thought about the intimacy of saying 'Cat' vs 'your sister', I thought it was nicely put.
I thought that 'Cat' (as opposed to sister, Catelyn, Lady Stark) would conjure up teenage memories for Lysa. Reminding her of LFs preference for Cat even then.
However maybe that is why GRRM went with 'Cat' in the book, and what works in books doesn't necessarily translate well to screen.
Â 
Cannot wait for Ep 8. As much as it breaks my heart (Oberyn *sob*)
908	Night's_King	2014-05-19	Oh, and one thing that really bothering me was the following:
Â 
They try to put nude scenes and sex scenes in every episode. Hell, they even write new raping scenes, just to show some boobs. And then there is one sex scene that is actually in the books and is important to the plot and then they don't show it. What the hell?
Â 
There is one sex scene that matters and they won't show it. Seriously HBO?!
909	Chloe.a.thomson	2014-05-19	I agree. Was glad to see they included it.


Â That is something that I was close to 100% sure they wouldn't include.Â 
I was grinning like an idiot when I realised where the conversation was going... Then tearing up as it progressed.Â

Â 
That was what I thought. I recall reading that somewhere.
Â 
She had many nude scenes in season 1, none in season 2 and one in season 3. I guess she doesn't want to shoot too many nude scenes.

dragon queen orders his mercenary to strip down in front of her to show his possibly impressive man parts and make love with her while she drinks her wine.
Â very creative and imaginative (for a horny 13yr old fantasy fanfiction starter)
the mostÂ  mediocre show that HBO has ever done, total fan-service (stupid ones)
and ofcourse they had to include stupid overly dramatic music in the long awaited "only cat" scene (I'm thinking of The Third Man influence), and they had to stress out "Your sister" otherwise they would confuse wide viewership of fantasy fans intelligentsia

I don't get why people want to believe so bad that Emilia's the actress who don't want to be naked anymore. -.- Especially when she denied it herself. If you want to pointÂ your finger at someone, I suggest you do that with an ex-porn star...

Â 
I think it's not that hilarious. "Only Cat" has a lot more meaning than "Your sister". I remember going to school after finishing Storm and talking to my friends about it. It was something like "How badass was this scene?! "Only Cat!" was so intense and added so much to the scene! I think it's one of my favourite lines ever!"
And I was just very disappointed, when they changed that. I just love the line. I hope they don't cut "Fetch me a block, Edd" or "Egg... I dreamed I was old..."
925	Clariana	2014-05-19	So I guess this establishes that the Bronn marriage is important enough to include on the show.

Game of Thrones After Dark. I see a great need
927	Tyranno	2014-05-19	I really liked the episode overall.Â 
Â 
But I think they did an absolutely horrible job at building up the Mountain. The only somewhat impressive feat he had was lifting a guy up with his sword. Everyone else with a sword could have killed those people.Â 
Besides, who were they, why were they killed and why were they given weapons?
Â 
They should have shown him in combat at least once IMO. So far the only things he has done on the show is kill a horse and butcher some untrained people. Many unsullied on other fora are not impressed with him at all, considering some fighters like Bronn, the Hound and Brienne have had awesome fight scenes and killed dozens of people. They are not impressed by his reputation either.Â 
Â 
Bad move by D&D IMO.
928	rmholt	2014-05-19	Â 
Indeed. Seems it may be significant. Good.

In the book Bronn walks out of the cell and out of his life. End of arc. BTW I thought that scene was absolutely true to the books. Bronn didn't betray Tyrion, ever. In fact he came by to see Tyrion and they had an honest convo.
929	sj4iy	2014-05-19	I was hoping for the trial scene where Oberyn declares himself as the champion.
Â 
Also Sansa should consider entering in one of those sand castle building competitions.

I'm honestly curious hoe many times someone had to rebuild that during filming?
930	rmholt	2014-05-19	Especiialy when Darrio has her every way a man can have a woman.
Â 
D+D wouldn't pass up that opportunity.Â 

As in the books the details are left to the reader/ audience.
931	Greywolf2375	2014-05-19	Oh great here come 5,000 posts complaining that he didn't say "only Cat"


Â 
Â 


Jeez, it was just one change of a line, can't believe people are upset.
Â 
Hell of a scene...hell of an episode.


Â 
Â 


hahaha Brilliant. I love it when purists get so annoyed over pretty insignificant changes like this one (albeit a very popular line). That has made my week.


It's not just that it is one line...it is sort of like dracarys, it has its own meaning to the story.Â  SinceÂ either one is only two words, why change it?Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
Bet both Sansa and LF lie and say Lysa fell.


Â Which will be weak IMO - a person who has been around the moondoor her entire life, knows how dangerous it is, all of a sudden falls out days after being married?Â  after some strange young lady shows up? Unless LF has already had people bought to buy that happening that wouldn't - pardon the expression - fly.
Â 


Also I don't understand why some people weren't happy with Aidan Gillen as Littlefinger, he's perfect for that role. It's one of those occasions where i, when i reread the books, put my own imagination completely aside and replace it with both the face and the voice from the show.


I think he is aÂ fine actor, the issue I have is that his voiceÂ & accent changes more than a 13 year old boys does.Â  I think they have written him as far less subtle and manipulative than he is in theÂ books, butÂ heÂ is doing very well with what story they have provided him.Â 
Â 


I think ultimo is right. That is what I thought was the logic behind the line change. Casuals could be sort of confused and forget who Cat is. She hadn't been called "Cat" for a couple seasons anyhow. It just made it more clear for some viewers.


Â 


Would someone who follows only the show even have realised who "Cat" is, without having to think about it for a sec?
Â 
Saying "your sister" just makes it more clear.


So at the same time the "unsullied" are quick enough to pick up on little hints and phrases in prior episodes, but in this one they wouldn't be able to pick up on her name?Â  Seems like reasoning needs to be consistent...either they can pick up on it or they can't.Â  It's not like we haven't had multiple scenes where it is reinforced that LF had a thing for Cat.
Â Â 


Couple things... seemed like Mel admitted she's full of crap and knows more about magic tricks than R'hollor secrets. Â Strange.


Â Yeah, that seemed a little odd...basically breaking the magicians rule by telling how the tricks are done.
Â
932	rmholt	2014-05-19	I thought the a Tyrion-Jaime scene was exceptional. Tyrion was actually counting on Jaime to be his champion - at least that's what I saw in his face, unlikely though he must have known it would be.
I don't see UnCat coming in this season. But D & D might shuffle things around between now and then to make it make sense. 
I'm just glad we don't have 3D or that moon door would terrify me.
933	Rockroi	2014-05-19	Someone mentioned it already but the point, which was made clearer with some excellent camera direction, is that Selyse had some serious misgivings about Mel and Stannis getting it on and is jealous of Mel's physical appearance. She also is completely devoted to Mel and their Lord and understands that it is all for their "greater good". In its own truly weird way it's an excellent scene to show Selyse hashing it out and Mel trying to comfort her in a peculiar but extremely effective way. She's naked obviously so Selyse can see her body and know that she doesn't exactly match up.
Â 
Plus calling the seen a waste isn't close to being true. Even if you didn't like the nudity it established that they're all getting out of there, including Shireen whom apparently the Lord "has a plan for". What that means is yet to be seen and we can all speculate heavily on it, but the blatantly obvious reason that they're getting Shireen out (Note: not the same as the Lord's plan for her, to be clear) is because Mel probably sees that Dragonstone is going to be taken by the Lannisters/Loras soon.


Â 
1. Really? Â "Excellent" camera direction? Â Not "The-Only Camera-Direction-That-Makes-Sense-In-This-Scene?" Â Really?
Â 
2. Selyse had serious misgivings about Mel and Stannis? WOW! Â Hold. The. Phone. Â A woman has "misgivings" about the woman her husband is fucking. Â Incredible. Â Who would have thought it? Â Look, I could have figured all that out on my own and, frankly, I don't know how much that has to do with the entire story as a whole. Â Honestly, Stannis is a second-level character, his wife a third (at best). Â DO we really need to know this about her? Â NOw, even if I agree with you, can't it be one or two lines later on in the show as a back-drop to another scene? Â Why have a stand-alone scene to tell us this? Â 
Â 
3. WE ALREADY KNEW SHE HAD A GOOD BODY! Â We don't need the 4th scene of her being naked to know that; we can infer Selyse knows it. Â Dear God...Â 
Â 
4. Anyone can tell us Shireen is part of the "Lord's Plan" and at any time. Â Do it when we all get to the Wall (any season now); do it on the ship; but do it as an ingrained part of another scene to save us all time and effort.
Â 
5. No clue why she needed to be naked. Â I know when a woman has a good body; I don't need to see her naked to know that. Â 
Â 
Look, the reason for the scene: They are on their third Mountain. Â 
Â 
That's why.
Â 
They are on their third Mountain. Â Why? Â Because the show-runners could not give the actors before enough to do to satisfy them so they found other things to do. Â Its almost happened with larger parts. Â But the issue is clear: some parts are bigger than others and the show does not want to replace actors as they grow board with their small parts. So, they throw them a bone. Â Here its clear: they want Mel to stick around, they want Selyse to stick around, so they manufacture a scene to get them together and talk, they get paid, and they will be around for season 5. Â . Â 
Â 
They don't want to be on their Second Mel. Â That's why that was a scene. Â

934	sj4iy	2014-05-19	Yeah pretty dumb the Hound is going to be done in by a little bite. Vargo Hoat had the same thing, but you can't compare The Hound to The Goat.

People died of many things back even more seemingly innocuous.  Any infection of any kind (especially on the neck) is extremely dangerous.
My cousin go a cold when he was 3 years old.  No big deal, right?  Until his lymph node on his neck swelled up.  Go to the doctor, and he has a MRSA infection of the lymph node.  It took 3 months of IV and oral antibiotics, as well as draining the infection every week to clear it up.  Otherwise, he would have died.
935	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-19	Â 
I think it's not that hilarious. "Only Cat" has a lot more meaning than "Your sister". I remember going to school after finishing Storm and talking to my friends about it. It was something like "How badass was this scene?! "Only Cat!" was so intense and added so much to the scene! I think it's one of my favourite lines ever!"
And I was just very disappointed, when they changed that. I just love the line. I hope they don't cut "Fetch me a block, Edd" or "Egg... I dreamed I was old..."

Yeah it's a brilliant scene in the book. I love it. 
I also loved it in the show. And if you go ok YouTube, there's a dub with only cat.
936	OnlyOne	2014-05-19	Yes I would've liked that a lot too. Â I think for the sake of entertainment that it would've been more shocking and intense if he would've revealed it in front of everyone. Â One of my favorite scenes in the book.

I thought it was much more powerful for Tyrion this way. And besides, at this point no one but Tyrion knows therefore the public declaration can still be made.
937	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-19	That's exactly what happens in the books though.
938	sj4iy	2014-05-19	HBO Canada will apparently not take a break and show episode 8 next week.

You sure?  Because that doesn't sound like something HBO would do.
939	ladyinblack	2014-05-19	Because it didn't matter. Â Whether he put her on a boat and it made a u-turn back to King's Landing, or Cersei/Tywin said 'guard her and you will die here and now, give her to me and you shall be rich beyond your wildest dreams, and given a stout keep.' Â It doesn't matter. Â Either way Bronn is Bronn, and Bronn loves himself more than...well anyone.
Yeah, Bronn is a sellsword & Shae, a whore with big ambitions so in the books the outcome was not surprising . On the show, the characters are much nicer but still no surprise here.
940	sj4iy	2014-05-19	"Only Cat" becomes "Your sister"?!?!?!
Â 
That can only be a deliberate middle finger to fans.Â  

Are you serious?
941	Fool of a Book	2014-05-19	A few more thoughts on second viewing:
Â 
The mercy-killed man is definitely foreshadowing. Â Whatever the lines were... they're fair in the North, give and take, but now everything is out of balance. Significant lines from a throw-away character.
Â 
This is the first episode that I liked Carice's acting. Â Too bad she was upstaged by her own nudity. Â I still think Mel can be glamoured, even without the ruby choker. Â Surely among her stash of magic potions she could have some glamourizer. Â Maybe in the form of stuff in a blue vial she puts in her bath. Â Show can still include her being glamoured, easily.
Â 
Incredibly weird but I was struck how much Daniel and Joe (Pod and Gendry) look alike. Â I mean, it was uncanny really. Â That's all I'll say.
Â 
I was OK without the giant doll destroying the castle. Â There was still a giant meaniehead destroying Winterfell snowcastle, and Sansa responding with outrage and out-of-character violence. Â I was fine with the bitchslap.
Â 
-
Â 
As for seeing LS as season finale, which I still hope will happen... I'm guessing they'll have a scene like the books, with LS getting revenge on a Frey or two.
Â 
Someone upthread surmised the season finale would be Brienne and Pod getting hanged, and I also thought the showriters would save LS's reveal for Brienne, but that means we need to see Arya leave the Hound, time passing, Brienne and Pod visiting the Quiet Isle (with or without Meribald and Dog?) and glimpsing the black stallion and the gravedigger, Gendry's return to the story.... and those are the bare minimum things that should be included in Brienne's storyline before she meets UnCat.
Â 
LS taking down her hood and showing her face to a doomed Frey would be a perfect cliffhanger, and the scene needs precisely zero set-up with other main characters.
Â 
Unless the writers choose the reveal of BR to be the cliffhanger.
Â 
ETA if they let Shae live and turn her into the Tysha of Tyrion's WDWG? obsession, I am going to be spitting fire. Â They've already set it up. Â All Jaime needs to do is tell Tyrion that he found out Shae only lied to try and save him, Tyrion gets "she does love me!" sparkles in his eyes. Â Damn, they've set it up to happen that way. Â Makes me incensed just thinking about it.

942	Cersei the Great	2014-05-19	Â 
she smiled when littlefinger insinuates that he killed joffrey because he'd harmed her family. she'll cover for him.Â 


Â 
She'll cover for him alright...especially when he threatens to let Cersei have her if she doesn't. Â lol
943	ultimo12	2014-05-19	I still think "OnlyCat" is one of those book-fan things that started to take on it's own dynamic in places like these. So you get book-readers exchanging knowing looks, saying how "OnlyCat is going to happen this season/next week", whatever, with Show-watchers looking confused, wondering what that means. And then the scene comes up and LF says "your sister". So the show-watchers say "What was that Only Cat thing now?" and suddenly the book-fans look somewhat silly. So the only thing left to do is to go into a deep think and make up a whole paragraph about why it had to be "Only Cat", why that line is of such importance and why it should not have been altered.
944	joaozinm	2014-05-19	Too much noise for a "your sister" really guys... Â I regret much more that oberyn and tyrion dialogue didnt had the : ""Yes, but you are here now, and in some difficulty, I would say. Your innocence may be as plain as the scar on your face, but it will not save you. No more than your father will." The Dornish prince smiled. "But I might."Â "You?" Tyrion studied him. "You are one judge in three. How could you save me?"Â "Not as your judge. As your champion."
945	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-19	I thought it was much more powerful for Tyrion this way. And besides, at this point no one but Tyrion knows therefore the public declaration can still be made.

I complained about the lack of "I will be your Champion" last week, but I have to admit I was wrong. This was better, just for that scene and Dinklage's subtle but utter relief at the end
946	Night's_King	2014-05-19	I complained about the lack of "I will be your Champion" last week, but I have to admit I was wrong. This was better, just for that scene and Dinklage's subtle but utter relief at the end

Subtle?!
947	Cersei the Great	2014-05-19	I started a thread on this but it's awaiting approval: Mel was not wearing her ruby.


I noticed that too. Â I didn't think she would take it off even for a bath.
948	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-19	I'd say that change from trying to hide his terror, and pain and grief and anger at how Cersei had basically wanted this since he was born to almost crying in relief, all in one subtly different facial change was difficult and subtle acting
949	Cersei the Great	2014-05-19	SnowOther, on 18 May 2014 - 9:56 PM, said:


Wow! that kissing scene was very disturbing


Â 


Â 
I know, I was hoping they would cut it.


Â 
I'm glad they didn't cut it.

For me, his facial expression at the end was pretty obvious.
951	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-19	Obvious to see but a subtle piece of acting. Maybe I should have said delicate?
952	Jehanne	2014-05-19	The way Selyse was looking at Mel...
Â 
Â 
to me, it seemed like Selyse was actually sexually attracted to her, not envious. (Well, maybe a little envious, but it looked like the desire overrode the envy.)

Â 
Agreed. Â Can't wait to see the next episode when Oberyn declares himself even more now XD
954	Cersei the Great	2014-05-19	I Â really don't understand why Tyrion did not ask Bronn about his betrayal on shipping off Shae. Â They just skipped over that. Â It's a hole in the plot.


I thought that as well. Â It doesn't make sense. Â I guess he just understood that Bronn had been paid a higher price???

I think it will be explained the moment right before she gets a dart on the neck. Probably Bronn did send her but failed to assure her departure.
956	Pericles	2014-05-19	Another good episode; Littlefinger is one creepy MoFo.
Â 
Emilia Clarke is sexier then ever in this one. I mean, confidence is sexy and all, but come on!
957	Cas Stark	2014-05-19	I don't think it was Bronn who betrayed him, someone else got to her after he left. Â It would be too big of a departure for his character.
958	johnnysd	2014-05-19	I actually could not disagree more, I loved the Stokeworths in the books. Mama Stokeworths trying to marry Lollys off by peddling goose, Lollys not realising that Shae was a fraud, little baby Tyrion, and finally the epic cock up with Bron.
I hope the show keeps at least some of these elements.


Â 
Crap I meant Lady Stoneheart. Typo on my part
959	Chloe.a.thomson	2014-05-19	In the book Bronn walks out of the cell and out of his life. End of arc. BTW I thought that scene was absolutely true to the books. Bronn didn't betray Tyrion, ever. In fact he came by to see Tyrion and they had an honest convo.


Â 
I agree.
Â 
I never felt like I was meant to condemn Bronn for choosing not to champion Tyrion. He made the only logical choice he could, being a sellsword or a bastard has nothing to do with it.Â
960	Carl Rhaego	2014-05-19	I thought it was a good episode. I do have a few criticisms though. I don't get why they didn't have him just say 'Only Catelyn', would have been better than 'your sister' and the show viewers would have understood. I felt sorry for Lysa, she is a victim too, her whole life's been shit, no wonder she went crazy. The mountain looks too young, he's supposed to be older than the hound, but he looks 20 years younger. The Selyse and Melisandre scenes had a weird undertone, I hope they won't make those two have a lesbian sex scene but I wouldn't put it past the showrunners with their desperate need for exposed breasts...
Â 
Oh, and Darrio has a really nice body and a cute butt. Dany was visibly pleased. She was likeÂ  Â   . It was great to see a woman in charge in this male-dominated universe. Too bad we didn't get an actual sex scene. Dany hasn't been with a man since Drogo died. It has been forever for her, so it's an important moment. They should have shown more of it.
961	Chloe.a.thomson	2014-05-19	Â 
Crap I meant Lady Stoneheart. Typo on my part


  I was wondering how anyone could think that Lollys was one of the worst elements in the book. Seemed harsh.
962	igrewupinKL	2014-05-19	serious cringe on LF + Sansa kiss
Â 
My concern is, now that rorge and biter are dead, who will brienne fight? most of the memorable mountains men are dead...oh shit she is going to meet LS! 
Â 
Tyrion and Oberyn stole the show
Â 
Loved the Hound's speech about his brother, love roryÂ  Â  Not sure about Arya's emotionless killingÂ  
Â 
Daario's assÂ   . Not too keen on the actor though, too nice? but eghhh
Â 
If they hurt Shireen i will crack itÂ  
Â 
Almost cried when hot pie came on screen again! i loved his scene! "never give up on the gravy!"
963	joaozinm	2014-05-19	i guess the season finale will be the brienne and LS scene already... =\
964	Fool of a Book	2014-05-19	i guess the season finale will be the brienne and LS scene already... =\


Â The writers will need to cut out too much for that to happen. Â If Brienne meeting LS is the finale, Brienne doesn't have much to do until tWoW is released.
Â 
The LS reveal will probably be similar to the book. Â
965	Carl Rhaego	2014-05-19	One thing that annoyed me was that Tyrion didn't ask Bronn about Shae. He was supposed to make sure she gets safely on the ship and all of a sudden she's in cahoots with Tywin and Cersei and Tyrion doesn't suspect anything? No questions on whether he betrayed him or how Shae happens to be back in the city after Bronn clearly said he made sure she left on the ship?

2. Â Hot pie
3. Â Oberyn. Â Anything Oberyn. Â Going to miss him dearly. Â Wish they had made him Daario.
4. Â Sansa slapping bratty Robin. Â Sansa 1 - Robin 0

It was a good scene between Jaime and Tyrion (NCW continues to be absolutely amazing in every single scene this season), but this bugged me.

986	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-19	I have mixed feelings on the sealing of the Wall because it's diametrically opposed to Jon's later stance as well, but it does make a certain amount of sense at the moment? The tunnel is the one point where Mance's army can breach the Wall right now and if it's sealed, then Castle Black can hold back the attack for significantly longer. It's an appropriate solution for this situation where it's not a feasible solution for the situation after Mance's forces are beaten and scattered.


Â 
New day and new browser, so I can finally reply quote on any computer. Â  
Â 
I can see the point of having Jon learn that sealing the Wall is not a good idea, and eventually, he will be the one refusing to seal the gate. Â It just worries me twofold, that Grenn is the reason for it, and I do fear that D&D just DO stuff for the sake of doing it.......without great reasons, all the time. Â It would be nice to see Jon learn something (which he should already have learned from Ned, but okay, learn at the Wall), but I do fear it's more about Grenn's fate. Â I do hope I'm wrong on that count. Â I guess I'm still not over a lot of the S2 mess. Â

No questions on whether he betrayed him or how Shae happens to be back in the city after Bronn clearly said he made sure she left on the ship?Right.The Shae deal does not follow the book, but that's ok.So for , what?, Tyrion first makes a big deal about moving Shae, then asks and asks and asks about her from more than one person...Bronn shows up , nary a word from Tyrion, like "how could you?" or "what the hell happened"... well , even Tyrion could figure that out, but not to say a damned thing?Goofy.
993	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-19	I Â really don't understand why Tyrion did not ask Bronn about his betrayal on shipping off Shae. Â They just skipped over that. Â It's a hole in the plot.


Â 
Immediately in the wake of Joffrey's death, Tywin ordered the port sealed as Cersei ordered Tyrion's arrest. Â I've suspected all along that we will find out that Shae's ship may have just been taken during the all around port closure. Â Sansa was taken further out on the water to meet LF's ship. Â Still, I suppose Bronn could have been followed, I don't think he actually gave up Shae to Tywin and Cersei, though. Â Certainly not before Joff's death. Â I was pleasantly surprised at the Bronn marrying Lollys, I'm glad they kept it. Â
994	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-19	Man, Thorne's an even bigger cuntbag in the show. Really like the actor tho, he does a good job and - unlike Slynt - he knows what he's talking about for the most part. Still, can't wait till she gets checked by Jon, along with kissass Slynt.
Â 
All of Tyrion's convos were great, especially the one with Oberyn.
Â 
And I lol'd at LF kissing Sansa. I didn't think they'd actually do it in the show.


Â 
Did anyone else notice that immediately after LF kissed her and she pulled away.........Petyr did not have a lovey-dovey face on, he didn't appear to be a man swept up in the moment, he looked as if he was coldly reading her and the reaction from her and/or from Lysa watching? Â I always suspected in the books that LF set that whole thing up (getting caught with the kiss, he knew it was time for Batshit Crazy Lysa to go),and I wonder......if LF's look immediately after the kiss (lacking a loving or lustful look on his face, in his eyes) was D&D's interpretation or do they have confirmation? Â I suspect, this is just an early instance of many questions like that as the show continues the next few years, LOL Â

997	rmholt	2014-05-19	Right.
The Shae deal does not follow the book, but that's ok.
So for , what?, Tyrion first makes a big deal about moving Shae, then asks and asks and asks about her from more than one person...
Bronn shows up , nary a word from Tyrion, like "how could you?" or "what the hell happened"... well , even Tyrion could figure that out, but not to say a damned thing?
Goofy.

I'm sure he was positive Cersei or Tywin was behind this. I'm sure he never suspected Bronn. Note Bronn has always been 100% straight with Tyrion to the last.

Thanks, I'll have to check that video out. Â I only caught the look because I already rewatched the episode this morning. Â Actually, I did catch Petyr's lack of looking lustful last night but then just became caught up in talking about the show in general at home and online. Â 
Â 
I've always expected that scene to have some setup from LF...........can't say if he knew how far it would go immediately, but I suspect he knew Lysa had reappeared on the balcony. Â Besides, it's hard not to over suspect LF and Varys. Â I try to temper my suspicions, but hell, I'm still iffy on whether or not Marillion every really answered the call from The Blue.

I'm betting they verbally explain her doings. If they meet the Brotherhood it's going to be after Beric is gone....Brienne will probably meet up with Anguy or Thoros and ask to be taken to to leader/Beric only to have them explain they're following LS and she's been hanging Freys, etc...or show they Frey's being hung then get the big reveal.

I think that it had more to do with Lysa's reveal about Littlefinger's culpability in Arryn's poisoning and the letter to Catelyn two episodes ago, compounded with Lysa talking about it again in front of Sansa that forced Littlefinger to permanently shut her up.Â

Â 
Heh, I'd never considered that either, in all the years of reading the books and following the thousands of theories on thiss bbs and elsewhere.Â  Brilliant - an overused British word, but in this case, "quite" (another Britishy word) accurate.Â 
Â 
Did anyone else cheer when Lysa plummeted screaming to her death.Â  Yay!


i did when sansa hit sr
1009	Tyrion1991	2014-05-19	I thought the Dany scenes were a mixed bag.Â 
Â 
It was good to see her relationship with Daario and this cause tension between her and Jorah. This is what happens in the books.
Â 
Also I totally called it on Jorah being a member of the Golden Company.Â  
Â 
The problem I had is that they start arguing by about his "disapproval" and rather than calling out the heart of the issue (Jorah is jealous and loves her) like she does in the book, it sort of drifts into a morality lesson about the slavers. So we end up having a totally different conversation. It felt very odd and jarring, almost as if they wrote this as two separate scenes and then decided to mash them together. You could say that Dany and the audience are fully aware why Jorah does not approve of Daario; but in the books Dany is much more direct and blunt with Jorah over this issue. Jorah comes across more as a disapproving father figure than being jealous of Danys lover. Really Dany shouldn't entertain such a facade and would confront him with the real reason for his objections.Â 
Â 
Also, it does really feel rather late in the day to be having Jorah act jealous around Daario. Especially since he shouldn't even be in Meereen at this point.Â 
Â 
Â 
Plus and I was reserving judgement from a previous scene but the show has made it much clearer now. In Â the books, Dany makes the decision to act defensively, to turn away from war and DOES NOT attempt to nip the Yunkish problem in the bud. She COULD have done this. Many, many reviewers and readers of ADWD would say that she was weak and made many mistakes in not confronting the slavers directly early on. This is a huge deviation from the books and frankly is an attempt to shift blame. D&D is aware that Danys ADWD arc took flack for her being weak and vaciliating with her inaction. So they are putting this down to Jorahs bad advice which makes her follow the path of weakness; when in the novels Jorah tells her to get out of dodge...twice...once as a ghost. He does not tell her to be gentle with the slavers. It also creates a huge problem going forward. When Jorah gets exiled, why on earth would Dany continue to follow his prior advice and stay in Meereen to rule as a Queen peacefully? Surely she would adopt a warlike path of violence as is her clear and obvious preference on the show without Jorah telling her otherwise. Unless they continue to alter Danys ADWD arc the show could end up with really muddying the waters about Danys behavior and actions.Â

Â 
I do think that it's up in the air, left up to Chaos as LF would say, about WHEN LF expected to get results out of Lysa seeing the kiss. Â I suspect that in the very least LF was setting up the jealousy to play up on Lysa's paranoia and then.......drop the bomb, errrrrrrr, drop her out the Moon Door. Â Then again, as I mentioned in another post, it could have ALL been a setup, Marillion included, with the singer always working for LF. Â While I do expect Marillion to meet the same fate as Dontos, it's hard to KNOW for sure, especially with Robert saying he still hears him in the night. Â It just all leaves me wondering........where was the setup, how far did it go, and I do agree, either way, that spiel by Lysa confirmed for LF that is was definately.................Time for Her to Fly. Â (Isn't that a song title?)

1011	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-19	they had the perfect chance for tyrion to talk about tysha, but they didnt have him bring her up. "i sould have never believed that a whore could love me." he should have said. , "i should have learned my lesson the first time"
im starting to think that they are dropping that whole thing.
also, fucking sansa!. that whole segment of th show was amazing. i'll even forgive the "your sister" because it was so good. the stark theme as she walsk out... so many feels. that kiss. ugh. poor sophie. must have been pretty awkward to film.


Â 
I'm not so sure they've dropped it, the look on Jaime's face when Tyrion said that almost broke my heart. Â Just a look, but it spoke volumes I thought. Â
1012	Clariana	2014-05-19	They aged Jorah like 40 years looks like Dany left him out in the sun to rot as well, it is all very contrived anything they could do to make the Dany Shagging Daario more believable. I think it would of been smarter to have Daario sent off scouting and omitted the whole thing from the show. New Daario is awful.


Â 
I think Ian Glenn has been ill, certainly he's looking much older to me this season than the last... Excellent actor though, great for the character.
1013	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-19	Am I the only one who was mispronouncing "Lollys" this whole time?


Â 
Â 
Lollys is one name I did have right, it's Rorge that I had wrong all along. Â Who knew, he may be the Westerosi equivalent of French?? Â Then again, that could be the American of my accent, I never expected that little French twist in his name. Â
1014	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-19	I'm really surprised how critical some are being in this episode's feedback... stunned really. I thought the episode was phenomenal. Easily one of the best this season really... Â The depth of emotion in nearly all of the actors (except maybe Gregor Clegane and who cares, he's just a giant evil guy with a giant sword) - pretty much all were spot on perfect.
Â 
Oberyn / Tyrion scene blew me away... I cried like a baby. I cried for baby Tyrion who knew nothing but torment his whole life from Cersei and pretty much everyone except his brother who protected him. I cried for Elia and her children and the horrific way they died. I cried for Oberyn - because his vengeance is so lost and wasted.  Â ... The look of hope in Tyrion's eyes at that moment when Oberyn said he would be his champion. I cried for that lost hope.
Â 
Every other scene was awesome too - even the weird Mel / Selyse scene. I liked the "Only Cat" scene even without the trademark two words being said - who cares, the moment was still very intense and well done.
Â 
This whole episode seemed to be about relationships between two people who were somewhat adversary yet partnered by fate ... did anyone notice that?Â 
Â 
LOVED IT.
Â 
I even loved Littlefinger, funny batman villain voice and all. I love him!


 Â  with all of this. People complaining over Only Cat are just ridiculous. Someone mentioned it but Gillen's ever-changing accent might have mangled the words anyways and "your sister" has the same exact impact. We had just seen him talking to Sansa about her mother so saying "it's because the Unsullied wouldn't understand Cat" is a joke. A more realistic critique is how the hell are LF and Sansa going to get out of this one since there was no one else in the room? I'm not buying and I don't think the show trying to make us buy the Vale Lords buying "she just slipped" is a very good idea. Intelligent conversation would turn to trying to figure this one out.
Â 
Also Envie your relationships-partnered-by-fate idea is spot on. So many interesting dynamics right now and I like the buddy-cop-comedy-esque nature of the pairings. I actually LOL so hard at this point every time they have Arya kill someone, it's so ridiculous and over the top.
Â 
Finally just a musing here but I'm not sure I understand why everyone is bummed that we haven't heard more about the Sand Snakes yet. That plotline is going exactly where it should. Oberyn's brought up the fact that he has eight daughters and we don't actually meet any of them til pretty early in AFfC (IIRC Hotah's is the second chapter) where we meet Doran and three of them. It's going to be pretty obvious who they are when they all say variations of "my father was killed, we need to go to war". Just because they seem to be accelerating some plots doesn't mean they need to do that with all of them. While AFfC and ADwD are still very good they're quite the comedown, action wise, from StormÂ for very large chunks of time and pages, which will transfer to a good chunk of episodes at the beginning of S5. Relax.

1020	Vivianne	2014-05-19	I still think "OnlyCat" is one of those book-fan things that started to take on it's own dynamic in places like these. So you get book-readers exchanging knowing looks, saying how "OnlyCat is going to happen this season/next week", whatever, with Show-watchers looking confused, wondering what that means. And then the scene comes up and LF says "your sister". So the show-watchers say "What was that Only Cat thing now?" and suddenly the book-fans look somewhat silly. So the only thing left to do is to go into a deep think and make up a whole paragraph about why it had to be "Only Cat", why that line is of such importance and why it should not have been altered.


 Â  I had to laugh when he said it..."oh no here we go"
1021	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-19	I don't buy that argument. Â The same argument can be made if one wants to nitpick Cersei calling Jaime the Lord Commander, instead of Jaime or brother. Â It's just book readers clawing for straws.


Â 
While I'm not a purist who flips out at everything, while I do my best to go with the flow and enjoy the show (hell, I LMAO at Robb and Talisa and love at first sight over an amputation and dream up scenes of them and Ramsey being jealous, not to mention, you KNOW that Robb would have loved to watch Talisa at least do the Qyburn job on Jaime's hand), I don't think your example illustrates anything other than the point that how names or titles are used do mean something. Â Cersei is calling Jaime Lord Commander to establish distance between them, as each did many times in the books, such as Jaime using Your Grace with Cersei. Â That goes back and forth alot in the books, and it's them showing us, and each other, their developing distance. Â Just as 'only Cat' speaks of a man saying the name of the woman he claimed to love his whole life, who was on the show for three seasons and whose corpse will most likely be seen again.......instead of saying 'your sister' because, well, they don't seem to trust some with memory of details. Â FFS, if people, book readers or not, don't know who Catelyn Tully Stark was........they certainly don't know off hand who Lysa's sister is. Â 
Â 
Not all complaints are because, OH NO........it's different from the books. Â And not all who complain......hate the show, they might just actually want to see it done a bit better. Â They may want D&D to have some trust in the viewers. Â They may want changes to actually be improvements or at least a draw. Â It's not always a declaration of war, it's just discussion. Â

Why should we buy that though? Of course LF's bastard daughter would be coached to testify on her father's behalf and prove his innocence. If he portrays her as Sansa Stark her word would probably have even less worth. This is actually a very interesting challenge for D&D for once and I can't wait to see how they get them out of this. Using a she-just-slipped excuse shouldn't be enough for viewers to buy that the Vale lords would buy that excuse. Truly an interesting predicament.Â

"My wife caught me having a moment with my bastard daughter and got jealous I hadn't spent as much time with her. She tried to kill Alayne and cut it a little too close, if you know what I mean."
Seems a simple enough explanation.

Â

Its still possible we see some dangling Frey's. Â Brienne and Pod could stumble upon the Brotherhood executing a Frey.

1032	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-19	Good point, Harry. I don't think it'll be too difficult though. "My wife caught me having a moment with my bastard daughter and got jealous I hadn't spent as much time with her. She tried to kill Alayne and cut it a little too close, if you know what I mean."
Seems a simple enough explanation.


I guess the most logical thing they could do is have what you just said happen, then Lysa trips or something when she's with Sansa. Just saw the preview for next week's ep. so at least we know we'll see the meeting with the Vale Lords then.

While I'm not a purist who flips out at everything, while I do my best to go with the flow and enjoy the show (hell, I LMAO at Robb and Talisa and love at first sight over an amputation and dream up scenes of them and Ramsey being jealous, not to mention, you KNOW that Robb would have loved to watch Talisa at least do the Qyburn job on Jaime's hand), I don't think your example illustrates anything other than the point that how names or titles are used do mean something. Â Cersei is calling Jaime Lord Commander to establish distance between them, as each did many times in the books, such as Jaime using Your Grace with Cersei. Â That goes back and forth alot in the books, and it's them showing us, and each other, their developing distance. Â Just as 'only Cat' speaks of a man saying the name of the woman he claimed to love his whole life, who was on the show for three seasons and whose corpse will most likely be seen again.......instead of saying 'your sister' because, well, they don't seem to trust some with memory of details. Â FFS, if people, book readers or not, don't know who Catelyn Tully Stark was........they certainly don't know off hand who Lysa's sister is. Â 
Â 
Not all complaints are because, OH NO........it's different from the books. Â And not all who complain......hate the show, they might just actually want to see it done a bit better. Â They may want D&D to have some trust in the viewers. Â They may want changes to actually be improvements or at least a draw. Â It's not always a declaration of war, it's just discussion. Â 


Â 
I feel the same way and I have been blasted on here a couple times for being a "purist." Thank you for succinctly summing up how I feel about the TV show. I have tolerated all of the departures from the books, even liked many of them, although it seems like the further we get along, the more the departures really mean to the story - perhaps because we're getting closer to the end.Â  I fully agree that if you're going to provide filler, at least make it better or more believable then what is going on in the books.
Â 


If that's true, it's going to be the most pirated single episode of a TV show history


 
Â 


The way Selyse was looking at Mel...
Â 
Â 
to me, it seemed like Selyse was actually sexually attracted to her, not envious. (Well, maybe a little envious, but it looked like the desire overrode the envy.)


Â 
I didn't like this scene that much.. it was cool to see Mel's things, but the unnecessary nudity was ridiculous and the insinuation that Mel will use Shireen for something was too much. I too thought Selyse was attracted to her by the way the camera panned down. I hope they won't make that a thing. Maybe it was supposed to be jealousy and I missed it...
1035	Eddard the Builder	2014-05-19	Would be interesting if they were like 'No way would Lady Lysa simply fall...' and then the scene cuts to Balon Greyjoy falling off of Pyke. Â

The nudity isn't unnecessary or gratuitous here; the scene is all but shot from Selyse's POV and it's making it clear that Selyse realizes how attractive Mel is since she's had misgivings about Stannis and Mel getting it on but her fervor for their Lord and her devotion to Mel helps her get through that.

Very solid and interesting idea. They're getting really good with those foreshadowing cuts and I wonder when Balon is going to die, although it's probably likely that he dies off screen. But I feel like that has to happen next episode or Ep. 10, will take literally a two minute scene with Asha receiving the news and deciding to sail back to make her claim to set it up.Â

Maybe it was bad acting but I had a hard time believing Selyse when she said that it was okay because of religious reasons. Either way, it was something that is really hard for me to wrap my head around. I have no idea what that scene meant.

She was showing Selyse in her true form, baring all to her.

also slightly more cutting to Lysa, though obviously she knows who Cat is either way.

It's been established for a few episodes now, I thought. When I saw this scene I wondered why the heck they haven't left yet. Despite it all, it's quite a journey to the wall, especially in late fall. I guess I am just super confused about the direction they're taking this plotline in.

From a show only-perspective the viewer knows for sure some sort of plan to go up there has been in place since Davos told Stannis about it last season, but it hadn't been confirmed on the show until this week. Last week we had the whole Iron Bank plotline which Stannis needed (and apparently he needed Saan's ships too) so they couldn't confirm sailing in the show-universe until the $$$ and ships were secured.
Â 
We know Stannis will be at the Wall in Episode 9. It's doubtful we get a Stannis scene next week unless they want to spend one minute on showing him sail finally. Where they are going with Shireen's plotline is less certain but at least they are alluding to the fact that they might want to burn her for prophecy stuff. Â Â

Yeah, I think they will stretch out the fighting at the Wall as long as they can to make it seem impossible for anyone to help them and then have Stannis sweep in at the last minute.

sure it does, to some extent... they've spent 4 years with LF referring to her as "Cat" ... if unsullied can't tell who he meant had he used that line, they're stupid
Â

Â 
~~3. WE ALREADY KNEW SHE HAD A GOOD BODY! Â We don't need the 4th scene of her being naked to know that; we can infer Selyse knows it. Â Dear God... ~~

Exactly. With all of Episode 9 set at the Wall they've got plenty of time to do it. I would not be surprised at all if out of the whole 50+ minutes they have allotted for the ep. that STANNIS! STANNIS! STANNIS! takes up 90 seconds or less. After all, there's plenty of other things to focus on.
Â 
-There's the scarcrow soldier prepping on top of the wall, as well as barricade and defensive prepping around CB.
-There's the assault on the wall itself from the north. There will be a fight under the gate where Grenn probably perishes in place of Donal Noye.Â 
-There's the skirmish/raid from south of CB. Jon is organizing the defenses and does plenty of fighting. We see Ygritte get shot down by that little boy (Satin, they might even have Jon ask him his name in the show while they're on top of the Wall.) Ygritte and Jon death scene will probably be 5+ minutes.
-There's the continued, secondary assault from the north. Probably will get some scenes from the Wildling camp in here as well where we see their organizational strategy. Would expect the same from the NW camp.
-There's Jon being commanded to go speak to the Wildlings.
-There's Jon in the tent when Stannis arrives. The tent scene will probably be longer but again, I don't expect more than 90s worth of time to see Stannis' knights thundering out of the woods. Expect to hear warhorns, see horsemen charging and running down the unorganized wildlings, Jon seeing the fiery stag banners, hearing the STANNIS! chant, and turning back into the tent.
Â 
I'd really expect that last scene to end the episode. If they decided their isn't enough room in Ep. 10 for whatever reason to elect Jon LC and/or have Stannis offer him Lord of Winterfell there's a small chance that all happens this episode too. But it certainly should end with Jon turning back into the tent.

Â 
I liked this episode a lot, actually. The three Tyrion scenes were all fantastic and I think the placement of Oberyn's story about baby Tyrion was more effective here than it would have been earlier. I was particularly happy with the Bronn scene. That played out perfectly, and I'm looking forward to seeing some of his hijinks play out on screen next season. I hope so anyway. Oh, and Hot Pie! For a very brief moment after seeing him and cheering I thought.. wait, are they just bringing him in so they can have him die horribly here? The show has me kind of worried for minor characters getting killed off without affecting the overall story.Â

There's still so many epic things to happen in Ep. 10 "The Children". Your point on children coming into their own is cool. Don't forget Tyrion killing Shae/Tywin and the latter making him the rightful Lord of CR in the process, thus "coming into his own" in a way. But I would agree that Jon becoming LC would probably be the last scene, unless they end on a darker note and show Dany locking up her dragons after that farmer dude brings back the bones of his child.
Â 
Plus I know there's a healthy amount of of speculation that the "children" alluded to can either be Dany's dragons or the Children of the Forest; both are valid arguments. I sort of like your opinion better though now.

The imbd page for the episodeÂ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3060858/ credits only Dinklage as a character that we know isn't in the NW/Wildlings or with Stannis and co.--they may have just listed him to show as part of the "previously on" or in some flashback.

Yeah you're probably right. Hopefully they do it justice then and give Bran and co. 10+ minutes of getting to the cave, fighting off the wights, BR's appearance and everything to make it as epic AF as possible. I'd also expect Jon stuff to lead off the episode then; Stannis' Â victory should be the first scene and pick up where Ep.9 leads off, then Jon elected LC somewhere in the middle-2/3rds portion of the ep.

This. The whole time during the speech in episode 6 and then watching Tyrion quiver when Oberyn is telling him the story I was just thinking, well, here's the material D&D will send in for Dinklage's Emmy nomination this year. Phenomenal stuff. Really I think Jack Gleeson should be nominated as well but we know he'll never get the justice he deserves, unlike Joff.Â

I suppose as a hardcore book reader and a casual show watcher I may have gotten ahead of myself  I think there was a snippet in the preview for next week of what I assumed to be Stannis's ships setting sail for the Wall. I will have to go rewatch it on Youtube. If it turns out to be Stannis, I believe we may see him leaving in episode 8, briefly. I'm too lazy to look up the cast listing, atm!

Rewatched the preview, but didn't see the ships. I could have sworn I saw them sometime last night when I was tuned into HBO. I guess I shouldn't drink before I watch the episodes anymore.

Â 
Yeah he will join the Hunger Games for District 12 in season 3
1073	Caesar beyond the wall	2014-05-19	Given how they are managing with the best one liners, I pretty much expect Jon next season to say "Ed, please fetch me a block of wood so I can chop off this mans head".

I wouldn't be surprised to see him say "Chopping block" or something of that nature, just to emphasize what he plans on doing.

Honestly, I don't care as long as I get to see Jon separate Slynt's head from his body.

But I think the showrunners will go the straightforward route and excise Stoneheart from the series.

Or is there a way around IMDB's casting lists? They do not show Fairley...

Come on, they aren't giving that away. I haven't seen any links to interviews in which she says she's not returning but would appreciate one.  Here's an interview in which we are teased in GRRM style by Fairley re: reappearing http://m.huffpost.co.../entry/3375895/

Â 
That clip makes me wonder if LF is supposed to have developed throat cancer over the years and we just haven't got to it in the books yet.
1085	OnlyOne	2014-05-19	From a show only-perspective the viewer knows for sure some sort of plan to go up there has been in place since Davos told Stannis about it last season, but it hadn't been confirmed on the show until this week. Last week we had the whole Iron Bank plotline which Stannis needed (and apparently he needed Saan's ships too) so they couldn't confirm sailing in the show-universe until the $$$ and ships were secured.
Â 
We know Stannis will be at the Wall in Episode 9. It's doubtful we get a Stannis scene next week unless they want to spend one minute on showing him sail finally. Where they are going with Shireen's plotline is less certain but at least they are alluding to the fact that they might want to burn her for prophecy stuff. Â Â 

"Burn her for prophecy stuff"? LOL. Anyway, doesn't that seem a blatant misdirection?
1086	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-19	Â 
I'm hoping to see Jaqen with his new face taking care of Balon.


Â 
Nah, nah, nah. Â I'm hoping to see THE Jaqen face being worn while taking out Balon. Â Â It would be funny, though, if the fall did come right after a........no way would the Lady Lysa fall, drunk or crazy, maybe they just think the girl had coordination? Â LOL Â
1087	Jojosh	2014-05-19	Man this season has really kinda been all over the place. Now we have nothing but filler with some plots and were speeding through other plots.
I can only imagine what dany's storyline will be like next season and look at sansa and arya. so much stuff just being thrown all over the place.
What was even the point of having that lesbian vibed up scene with melisandre and selyse?
At least Tyrion is getting his due but I'm curious about how were going to get an info dump about oberyn with only 3 eps left.
1088	The Night's Prince	2014-05-19	Â 
I very much wanted to see a whole court reveal of Oberyns choice to defend Tyrion.
Â 
I really wanted to see it during the trial. Something like:
Â 
"And who will you name for your champion?" Cersie looks smug naming the Mountain. Tywin looking vicious Jamie looking concerned.
Â 
Tyrion says nothing. Looking around, semi-panicked.
Â 
"Looks like you are all alone, baby brother." Cersie says. Oberyn rises from his seat.
Â 
"No. Not alone."


Don't see why they still can't do that. Knowing Tyrion he'd enjoy that and play his part perfectly.
1089	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-19	Given how they are managing with the best one liners, I pretty much expect Jon next season to say "Ed, please fetch me a block of wood so I can chop off this mans head".

1090	Le Cygne	2014-05-19	No Ghost, to me again. Sigh.
1091	jons nissa	2014-05-19	In season 3 I felt the Jaime-Brienne scenes eclipsed everything else, but these past two episodes have had so many powerful scenes between actors that it's taken the series to another level. This is the best it's been since season 1 IMO.


Â 
i agree. the episodes have been creative and full of twists. it's definitely one of their better seasons.
1092	sj4iy	2014-05-19	No Ghost, to me again. Sigh.


Â 
I liked how he barely mumbles "Come on, Ghost" and the dire wolf comes straight to him. Â Ghost looked really good in this episode, too. Â
1093	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-19	As for how LF is going to pull one over on the Lords Of The Vale:
Â 
1.Â  Lysa slipped, "you know how that crazy lady always left that thing open"
Â 
2.Â  Lysa suicide.
Â 
3.Â  We get the Corbray incident early.Â  He draws steel, making the lords look bad (and we hopefully get the hilarious "what the fuck are you, a FREY?Â  Put that down!" line), LF turns this to his advantage much the same way it happens in the books, just earlier.Â  They can even follow up with his "gimme 12 months as LP" bargain, and his subsequent reveal to Sansa that Corbray is on the payroll as his Cointelpro dude, and that LF the brothel owner is of course paying Corbray in boys.
Â 
Of course I have no idea if Corbray is even cast...
Â 
4.Â  But even without that LF would have to divide and conquer the vale lords somehow because the story is dodgy and Bronze Yohn is going to look like an utter moron if he doesn't at least half-call shenanigans on "lysa slipped, honest!"Â  Fast-tracking Corbray into the show seems the most efficient way to have LF divide and conquer.
1094	Konradsmith	2014-05-19	^Cobray is cast. He's visible in the ep. 8 promo sitting next to Bronze Yohn and Lady Anya.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 19 May 2014 - 05:41 PM.
1095	Colonel Green	2014-05-19	Based on the promo for next week we're going with Littlefinger offering a fake explanation and then Sansa giving them the "real" explanation, which is undoubtedly a second fiction.
1096	harokin	2014-05-19	Best episode of the season so far. My favorite parts where the scenes at the Eyrie and anything Tyrion-related, specifically the one with Oberyn.
Â 
The snow castle scene was exactly like I pictured it from the books. Also glad they kept the kiss. Sophie Turner was great in jumping between innocent Sansa and (hopefully) the more conniving Sansa of the future. Sansa smiling at the death of Joffrey and slapping the hell out of Robin were dreams come true. 
Â 
I was afraid they wouldn't show the Tyrion/Bronn scene and keep Bronn around longer than necessary due to his popularity. It was important for Tyrion's plight to show he couldn't rely on Bronn anymore. Wonder if this was Bronn's last appearance in the show?
Â 
Too bad we only got one ep with Oberyn left.  Just when they're finding the right tone with the character. I feel they should have downtuned the brother-bits and brought the Red Viper stuff with the poison in earlier. Also would have been nice if they would have hired a really big name like Sean Bean for the role, kinda like shows like Shield and Sons of Anarchy have done by bringing in big stars on a one-season deal. They could have hyped Oberyn as the new Ned Stark of the show, and then shocked everyone by having him end up like the old Ned Stark.  Maybe Benicio del Toro would have been available?
1097	Fool of a Book	2014-05-19	It looks like the introduction to LS will be the Brienne and Pod encounter. 
Â 
I was hoping they would give the audience the chance to root for LS (taking out Freys and avenging the Starks) before despisingÂ her for wanting favourites dead (Jaime, Brienne, Pod).
Â 
I really wanted to see a Frey dangle, the Merrett scene was just so awesome!


No way Brienne and LS is happening this season. Â No absolute way. Â Despite Brienne wandering, significant things happen. Â If Brienne and LS happen this season, there is no screentime for Brienne until tWoW and aDoS. Â Unless D&D go into *future territory* tWoW next season with Brienne's arc, thereby giving away Jaime's arc.
Â 
Arya needs to not mercy-kill the Hound, Brienne and Pod need to get to the Quiet Isles for the black stallion and the gravedigger, and the discussion about Sansa, Gendry needs to be reintroduced... not happening this season.
Â 
LS revenge killing some Freys, I predict last scene cliffhanger of the season, right after the CotF and BR make their appearance.

Â
1099	The Lizard King	2014-05-19	Â 
I do think that it's up in the air, left up to Chaos as LF would say, about WHEN LF expected to get results out of Lysa seeing the kiss. Â I suspect that in the very least LF was setting up the jealousy to play up on Lysa's paranoia and then.......drop the bomb, errrrrrrr, drop her out the Moon Door. Â Then again, as I mentioned in another post, it could have ALL been a setup, Marillion included, with the singer always working for LF. Â While I do expect Marillion to meet the same fate as Dontos, it's hard to KNOW for sure, especially with Robert saying he still hears him in the night. Â It just all leaves me wondering........where was the setup, how far did it go, and I do agree, either way, that spiel by Lysa confirmed for LF that is was definately.................Time for Her to Fly. Â (Isn't that a song title?)


Â 
Time for Me to Fly by REO Speedwagon.
1100	Colonel Green	2014-05-19	Brienne and Pod need to get to the Quiet Isles for the black stallion and the gravedigger, and the discussion about Sansa, Gendry needs to be reintroduced... not happening this season.


None of that is needed, based on what we know to date.Â  It's not imperative that we tease the Hound's survival, for instance; they could just as easily have him show up whenever he ultimately does.Â  As for Gendry, why do they need to meet him beforehand?
1101	Le Cygne	2014-05-19	No way Brienne and LS is happening this season. Â No absolute way. Â Despite Brienne wandering, significant things happen.

I gave up protesting.
1102	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-19	Â 
sure it does, to some extent... they've spent 4 years with LF referring to her as "Cat" ... if unsullied can't tell who he meant had he used that line, they're stupid
Â 
Â 

i'm constantly amazed at the criticisms i read of nudity/sex and i rarely see anything written about violence/bloodshed... both violence and sex were a big part of this world, just accept itÂ

Well to be fair, they do have a point about Mel being naked in every season...

1103	Colonel Green	2014-05-19	After Rorge and Biter were dispatched so unceremoniously, I really don't see what other ending Brienne's story could possibly have this year.Â  There's nothing even remotely resembling a name enemy for her to fight -- there has to be more than "Brienne kills a few random bandits".
1104	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-19	well, there is the biting off a mans ear thing.

Â because if Brienne and LS are this season, there is no Brienne story next season. Â  It would be the same place we've left off in aDwD, with the exception of a single scene where Brienne seeks out Jaime.
Â 
And there are things that need to happen before Brienne meets LS.

Hmmmmmmm, I did notice that and now I do wonder. Â Haven't the Dothraki been the only ones to call him that? Â I could see Daario picking that up from what little is left of the khalasar, but now I'm curious if there is, or will be, more to it? Â

Random Thoughts:
Â 
- Hot Pie Cameo!
Â 
- Lysa's line about the "blue eyes" of the dead... hmmm....
Â 
Â 


Watching again last night, I was thinking maybe the "blue eyes" was a combination of her imagining Sansa's dead body AND a shout out from D+D regarding Others/Wrights
1110	Konradsmith	2014-05-19	That's a good approximation of what Brienne's screentime is likely to be next season, Colonel Green. IMO they should keep LSH's presence very minimal so as to keep up the enigma and horror of the character. If we see her too much we'll get used to her.

"Sandor shared the story of how he was burned by his brother over a toy and how his father took Gregor's side in the aftermath.
Like Tyrion, he was a second class citizen in his family. His story was mirrored by Oberyn telling Tyrion about meeting him as a baby and seeing the hate Cersei had for him even then. How fitting it will be if Oberyn, another second son, puts an end to three lifetimes of pain with one kill."

Â 
"Only Cat" would have if they'd set it up a little more but really "your sister" means the exact thing and has the exact same effect. Anyways it's not too difficult to dub in "only cat" in an LF impression and there you have it. Book version.

1124	Brandon Martell	2014-05-19	Â 
What was "Fantastical" about Dany being carried around by freed slaves?


The dragons flying in the sky above her while she's carried by all the slaves.
They could give yet another dragon scene, but I don't think there's any pivotal moment to put it there, and it just seems like the BR reveal would be a huge moment to non-book fans on if they pull it off right.
The NW elections would basically be like Robb's moment in season 1, lots of "Hell Yeah!" but not much "Holy Crap!".
Lady Stoneheart would be perfect for this, better than BR, but I don't know if it's happening this season. Let's just wait a few weeks and see.

Â 
However:
^This line, combined with Roose's dead pan delivery made my laugh out loud when reading the books, it cemented my love of the Roose and it was a lovely way of seeing Ramsey knocked down a peg (at a time when he is doing truly awful things).
I would LOVE to see it included, and if it cannot I would love an explanation as to why (not likely, i know)
Â 
and yes, "Ed, fetch me a block" would be wonderful as well.
1129	Uldra I	2014-05-19	Just now came to mind... Rorge and Biter have made their appearance now, so that means there won't be the riveting, gruesome, and bloody Brienne/Rorge/Biter scene later.Â  Â  I was really looking forward to that scene.Â

1130	Colonel Green	2014-05-19	I'm finding it hard to get a handle on Cersei's characterization.Â  This episode she was in full-on villain mode, swishing her way through dead bodies to evilly smile at evil Ser Gregor, while Oberyn told the story about her wishing Tyrion was dead as a baby and almost ripping Tyrion's wienie off.Â  Other episodes she's been the same Sad Mother we've been getting for the last few seasons.
1131	LionsAndTitsAndWineOhMy	2014-05-19	It was a great episode overall. Â I'm having a tough time deciding what deserves an emmy more: Â Tyrion's courtroom meltdown or The Great Hot Pie Gravy Monologue. Â Really wasn't feeling it with my first impression of the New Mountain, but as others have stated, that isn't something I'll have to deal with too long anyway. Â The Mel and Selyse scene was intriguing, but the Dany/Daario foreplay was a yawn (and you might well expect the God of Tits and Wine to say that, but I believe my point stands...).
Â 
Oh, and for those of you screaming with righteous indignation, claiming that Only Cat -> Your Sister was a middle finger from D&D directed at you and those like you? Â By all gods old and new, I wish it was true. Â If they had put the God of Tits and Wine in charge of this series, I'd soak in your tears the way Melisandre soaked in that bathtub...
1132	Schokolade!	2014-05-19	Oh great here come 5,000 posts complaining that he didn't say "only Cat"

^^ This!
1133	lostinwesteros	2014-05-19	The scene with Oberyn and Tyrion was the absolute best. Â Also liked T and Jaime. Â Not happy with the scene between T and Bronn, though . . . it kept Bronn's 'likeability' intact, which I think is completely undeserved.
Â 
Am frustrated with the short, choppy scenes we keep getting from the Wall. Â I know it'll get the whole show 4:09, but still . . .Â
1134	Colonel Green	2014-05-19	I will say, not that it's terribly important, but Bronn's book line about icing Falyse really didn't work for the character as developed in the show.Â  He's been made a bit too much of a cheerful rogue.Â  There was a kind of nastiness to the book version that is just absent from Flynn's portrayal of him.

1138	hedgeknight001	2014-05-20	Â Dany is boring as hell. Â Emilia is not working it out.

I agree. Except when she's speaking in High Valyrian, I don't think Emilia Clarke has the feel of Dany's lines right at all -- too imperious, too *self-aware* that she's being imperious, and every word sounded with a drawl. A bad royal stereotype.
1139	nara	2014-05-20	No biggie but it would have been so simple to combine LF's line to say something like:
"Only your sister"
Cut to her shocked face
"Only Cat"
Lysa go bye fly.


Â 
I nominate you to write for the show. Â I would have preferred Only Cat to Only your sister, though I can appreciate why they made the change. Â However, your version is better,
Â 


Â 
but the mountain isn't supposed to be cast for his great acting ability, is he?


I would prefer the Mountain not to speak at all. Makes him more mysterious and scary.
Â 


Caught one bit of information...Walder Frey is Lord of Rivverun on the show.Â  Makes sense.


Â 
I guess we won't get Genna Lannister and her Frey husband. Â Makes sense for character consolidation purposes but I really like her.
Â 


I got up and got myself something to drink during the credits and turned out the lights.
Â 
It's really not that big of a deal at this point in the season, is it?


It's sloppy and shows poor attention to detail. Â 
Â 
Â 


Sansa scene was great until Robert shows up. Robert seems pretty genuine in his mistake trying to make a moon door. Sansa has a right to be upset but she seemed only the slightly less childish party here. After that it was all decent, would have preferred "Only Cat" but not a big deal.


I agree. Â Sansa in the show is older but reacted like a child. Â I would have preferred that Sweetrobin deliberately attack the castle.
Â 


The thought that Ser Gregor would use a real sword at practice without wearing armour is ludicrous.Â  Accidents do happen...Â  I guess they needed their quota of nudity.Â  And why do we get full frontals of women in the series but never of the men, just asses (although some have been very fine asses.Â  But...)


LOL--was that practice? Â I thought he was executing people.
Â 


they had the perfect chance for tyrion to talk about tysha, but they didnt have him bring her up. "i sould have never believed that a whore could love me." he should have said. , "i should have learned my lesson the first time"
im starting to think that they are dropping that whole thing.


yes, that was a missed opportunity. Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Ok, now for my thoughts.
Â 
I liked the Jaime Tyrion scene. Â In the books, I liked wondering why Jaime was in the background at the trial and didn't stick up for Tyrion or even visit him before the trial by combat. Â However, this works too.
Â 
Not sure how I feel about comedienne Mel, but I do like the reveal of Selyse's jealousy and the hint that Mel may try to burn SHireen
Â 
I liked that they kept Oberyn's visit to Casterly Rock and Cersei's cruelty. However, I couldn't understand why they changed it so his father borugh tthem there. Â That seemed unnecessary.
Â 
I'm bored with Arya-hound. Â Sorry, but it had to be said.
Â 
I loved the Dany-Jorah exchange. Â FInally, some good lines for Jorah! Â But I kinda liked where they were going with ruthless Dany.
Â 
Sansa scenes. Â I agree that they were too rushed, especially for an episode called Mockingbird. Â Also, was it just me or did Sansa allow Petyr to kiss her for far too long??? I was not thrilled with Sophie's acting (which had been exceptional in some episodes) but she seemed very stiff. Â I thought the kiss was a little too abrupt. Â Having him help her with the castle and kiss her somewhat spontaneously would have made more sense. Â As someone mentioned above, having Lysa reveal more about the abortions/miscarriages would have been good.
1140	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-20	Did anyone else notice the way Bronn describes he could potentially take Gregor is almost exactly how it ends up playing out for Oberyn? "Dance around until he's so tired from hacking at me he drops his sword. Get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep and I'm dead."
1141	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-05-20	Any ideas on what happens with LF? I mean, there's no Marillion...
Â

1142	A Man Is A Man	2014-05-20	I'm finding it hard to get a handle on Cersei's characterization.Â  This episode she was in full-on villain mode, swishing her way through dead bodies to evilly smile at evil Ser Gregor, while Oberyn told the story about her wishing Tyrion was dead as a baby and almost ripping Tyrion's wienie off.Â  Other episodes she's been the same Sad Mother we've been getting for the last few seasons.


Â 
Â Even though a lot of book-readers decry that they've muted Cersei's character a bit, if you talk to unsullied watchers of the show they all think she is an evil mega-bitch, which is basically what she is in the books. So, I think they've just decided to pull back on showing every scene with her as this nutty evil woman and give us a few more shades, but the effect is the same. I don't know anyone that ever sympathizes for Cersei.
1143	Mark the Red	2014-05-20	Oh, lets not forget "Don't make me rue the day I raped your mother."

The line that made me laugh the most in the whole series was from the Davos chapter:
"Lord Wyman was looking down at Rhaegar as if he were a roach in need of a hard heel"
My favorite chapter in the series hands down.  Pure awesome from front to back.  Willa's outburst in defense of Stannis.  Davos calling BS on the Freys: "What would a Frey know of honor?" "Set Jared I name you liar."
  Especially when you get to the Theon chapter when Wyman lies to the Frey's  in front of the Boltons and tells them how fond he has grown of the Frey's at White Harbor especially Rhaegar.
Lol calling Robb Stark a vile dog in front of Wyman.  I bet Rhaegar did not die well.  No sir.
The North remembers.
1144	Rapsie	2014-05-20	More of Lysa's back story would have fleshed out the character from a cardboard cut out crazy lady into a character with motivations and an understandable grievance. However as they cut out all the Hoster stuff I guess it made sense to cut out the Lysa backstory too. 
I can understand why people are upset by the loss of "only Cat" but show only watchers would have missed it. My other unsullied half still can't remember Dany's name never mind Cat, whose role in the series was minor compared to the books.
1145	rmholt	2014-05-20	Did anyone else notice the way Bronn describes he could potentially take Gregor is almost exactly how it ends up playing out for Oberyn? "Dance around until he's so tired from hacking at me he drops his sword. Get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep and I'm dead."
Yes when I originally read it. <?>
I can't take credit for noticing it because Tyrion pointed it out.

1146	Dipsy	2014-05-20	What has happened to this series?
Â 
Why hasn't Stannis recruited any Companies of Sell Swords once going Braavos then travelling to Esos. Building up his depleted army once being loaned a vast sum of gold to achieve victory from the Iron bank.Â  Were we so stupid to assume that the Lannisters forge gold? Because their last gold mine has run out, not any of the other associated ores, mined alongside gold. Like copper, iron, tin, etc, these ores which are turned into gold/currency. The iron Bank will lend to Stannis even though there has been no formal defaults from the new king Tommen or from his council. Previously when ignored by an angry mother in time of immediate war the battle of the Black Water. How does this new event from Iron bank, prevent further interaction with the Night's Watch in later plot. The Wildlings settling in the gift, Castles maintained, Food stores, Ships. Stannis is now preummed that other banker, who will loan for the crisis upcoming? He rererucited Salandor Saan navy,Â  presumed as still docking at DragonStone for payment. Oops forgotten, for this other attempted schemes hole.
Â 
What is wrong with Deanery's acting? So rarely is she seen as subtle, seductive, in much of a manner of the stately elegant queen. Often perceived through speech as an angry kid, yes she has dragons. Her lines in expression have mostly been forced when showing her entirely as argumentative, when she is coy, sounding childlike with goofish smirks. Almost in duplication of a Cersei whom has a reason to be angry and vehement. Although Deanery's looks pretty and smiles, sure, but that is not really the entire point.
Â 
Where in Meereen is the opposite of the Westerosi Throne Chamber in holding hosting court, that is entirely empty, devoid of anyone but her own guardsmen. The queen's private quarters looked like a japanese bubble apartment, being a tiny little bedroom with a futon. Not that 4 poster, luxurious penthouse, housing scenic views of the entire city, with adjacent water gardens, handmaidens, unsullied guards, bodyguard bloodriders.
Â 
Having one of the best fight scenes in Game of Thrones currently with some nobody cutthroat in the prior episode. When removing the remaining deserter's of the Night's Watch from Castor's Keep. So great a fight in fact, the cut throat didn't even cut a throat, previous to this epic melee when holding onto a hostage.
Â 
The Whitewalkers who were at the Fist of the First Men. Now are resorting to Baby Knapping to replenish their numbers. Over the huge army seen previously which forced a retreat of the Night's Watch back into Castor's. Further making Castor's Keep immune to any later annihilation from offering baby sacrifices to appease. Because the White army has not been scavenging the corpse trail leading back to Castor's.
Â 
Wildlings are roaming free outside of Castle Black unchecked because they cannot read any Sign Posts, scouting from Mole Town, in the previous raid which informed the Watch via the boy. Observing any Night's Watch forces within the Black Castle. Attacking at the best opportunity when fighting men are out ranging. Those same men of the Watch have not netrualised the immediate Wildling threat. Because they are in fear, worried about a fight coming with Mance's Wildling army. This fight will happen upon any events, depsite of any pointless information obtained from deserters.
Â 
Everybody Killed Jeffrey. Who really killed Jeffrey was it Lady Tyrell, or Littlefinger? Not the Imp though. These two separate groups and motives, have said explictaly they did it. Cersei has had conversation with Margaery accepting the loss of her little monster, how quick to remarry her other son, whom she cannot guard from the Imp's guilt.
Â 
Is Esos really accross the Chunnel close enough to be housing Vary's little Birds. These Bird's have been shown as everywhere from White Harbour, Iron Islands etc. Not taking the years to travel to and fro between. When showing those same years at times throughout the season for Tommen to age into an adolescent, Arya to gain the pounds, Dragons to fledge.They have often been in the next sceens ordered to act out some grand Westrosi schemes. Now against Deanery's. Why is their information being brought to light of huge stately importance to the small council's present state. With no other real immediate issues addressed such as budget, present conflict, etc, small mention of ships. Because accross the chunnel is a queen who has dragons, quickly send more spies to what? Manipulate Jorah into betrayal, inform of Selemy but cmon now, Vary's later role was what exactly?
Â 
Asha, Theon, and the Bastard. Asha's grand quest to capture her brother Theon ending in tears. Asha was just at the Iron Islands beforehand, being chided not to get her brother from her father, the King of the Ironborn. Asha has not managed to capture Reek. Because he is needed at Moat Calin being ordered by Roose Bolton to be used to retake previously, now after present events a reward. Asha could not knock Reek out, carrrying his hobbling husk when attempting escape, forgetting to silence the dogs barking, alerting the guards. There was aÂ  plot hole in the rescue attempt, the Ironborn were trapped said by her guardsmen there is only one way in. What are her options now? Try again, after claiming that Reek is no longer her brother? Try to kill the Bastard at a different opportunity, because forgotten during attempted rescue? Disappear again back into Torhen Square which is already occupied by Ironborn, shown from the Bastard's ruse with Theon prior? Go and get more men whom she didn't bring on her quest? Go home with his tail between her legs?
Â 
The Imp has been absolutely moppy outside of his haircut, this entire season. Although shown to be happier in jail with Poddrick, now back to being moppy again. His speech at the trial was outstandingly epic though and with given congradulation. The great actor playing this role having so much persona in former seasons when winning award, is so unnaturally glum of late, desipte any affecting circumstances within this show.
Â 
The Red Priestess setting her sights on Shireen. Is this an assumed spoiler for her next sacrifice, in some seasons away build up, that because grey scale is not attributed to R'hllor Shireen must be burned for King's Blood? Why is this information of any particular note, seen in plot for a few episodes of late?
Â 
I would be here all day, litterally, if continuing picking apart the lack of details shown within so many sceens. Examples. Showing blood/wax magically appearing on the Bastard prior to the rescue attempt. A shepherd boy not being burned from a tsunami of dragon fire on top of him. The most pointlessly ridiculous crucifixion executions seen any where on TV, serving only to force out hammy moaning groans, which did not replicate a sign post, rather would topple escape from the ways shown.Â 
Â 
I was hoping for some sense of explanation to other points listed above?

1147	tyrell19	2014-05-20	Loved watching this episode with my unsullied family. As Petyr approached Lysa at the end they were all screaming "make her fly"
1148	Lord Varys	2014-05-20	For the record:
Â 
I've reached out to the German dubbing guys to get 'Only Cat', Doran/Oberyn's mother, and Tanda Stokeworth back into the show in the German version. Asha is in there, too, so hopefully this will work.
Â 
On Lysa:
Â 
I really missed Sheepshit. It would be great for both Littlefinger's and Lysa's back story to go there, and have the wedding there, to illustrate how much Littlefinger resents his origin. That really shows in his talks with Sansa while there are 'at home'... And there was really no need to rush into AFfC territory.
1149	Uldra I	2014-05-20	I love watching with my unsullied brother.Â  Until this episode he hasn't had too many questions about who is which character, and what are the motives behind the things they do.Â  In fact it has always surprised me how much he picked up from the shows without me saying a thing.Â  This episode was different though.Â  He couldn't keep Daario andÂ Oberyn strait... the Hound and the Mountain took explanation, that they are brothers... from ep 5 he didn't get Bran's warging ability... he didn't know Daenerys' name... and he needed me to explain Lysa's history with Littlefinger to understand her line aboutÂ  her father, her husband, and her sister all dead because they came between her and LF.Â  He also complained that so many of the names are the similar or the same, and that some characters are referred to by multiple names.
Â 
Really, I think the show has done an excellent job overall, but maybe they could figure out a way to help unsullied show fans to remember characters and understand some of theirÂ backstories a little better?Â  My brother is no mental slouch, so I figure if he's starting to have trouble following things, probably others are too.Â  When I read the books, I overlooked a lot of detail and became confused with all the characters because it was too much to absorb in one reading.Â  Second time around opened all kinds of rich new detail because I had a basic idea of who the main players are.Â  Maybe the shows will work like that on the unsullied?Â 
Â 
ETA:Â  Not really criticizing.Â  I certainly couldn't have done better.Â  Just wondering if there might be something the show writers could do, and thought it worth mentioning.Â

1150	GallopingGhost	2014-05-20	I meant reviews. You can go online the day after an episode airs and find plenty of reviews that draw on the up to date source material without going into the stuff that ranges into spoilers.Â 

If viewers have to read reviews after each episode to figure out what is going on, the TV show is not doing its job.

Â 
Â 
If people who arent getting it are still watching the TV show is doing it's job.
Â 
That said, I think D & D are making things a lot clearer than in the past. If they make it too obvious there is no suspense.
Â 
Book readers certainly have to wait - sometimes several years/thousands of pages to know wth went on at many points.
Â 
There are more episodes coming up. As Michelle Fairley said - keep watching.
Â 
There ARE reviews out there to get background from and if people go there, then fine. I watched The Master and I am going to have to do a little Google to find out what the heck? Â Yet it was highly rated. I had to watch Memento a few times and take notes. People can survive a little subtlety and like some people on the forums can wait a week or so to see if confusing events are explained.
Â 
ETA: Roger Ebert seems to have had the same take on The Master as I did.

Â 
I didn't like the way the line about Falyse was delivered (or the fact that it even existed)Â but for different reasons.Â  BookBronn is not the one who hurt Falyse, Cersei set all that in motion.Â  The only thing we cannot be sure of is what happened to Lady Tanda, the first fall and the eventual death, but.....old ladies do fall and die from broken hips all the time.Â  Who's to say that Bronn had anything to do with it.Â  It could have been drunken Falyse with the intitial bump of her mother down the stairs.
Â 
I don't understand why some think that BookBronn betrayed Tyion anyway.Â  He really wasn't required to die for him, and Tyrion himself understood it.Â  It's just the show has a bit of lighter tone with Bronn's darkest side.Â  For the most part, I was pleased with the cells scenes on the show, I guess I need to double check and see if BookBronn made anykind of cracks like that, that sounded soooooooooooooooooo obvious, anyway.Â  I pretty sure he did, can't say I remember the exact wording, though.Â  I do remember Tyrion wondering if Cersei realized what kind of serpent she is sending to the Stokeworths.Â  It's the manner of dialogue delivery that, at times, makes Bronn seem lighter on the show, but lots of it is similar to the book.Â  It just pisses me off that he seems to be given the blame already for the later mess at Castle Stokeworth when it was Evul Cersei, LOLÂ 
Â 
ETA:Â  Oops, just remembered, Lady Tanda had an accident with the horse and saddle straps or some such.Â  The old ladies down the stairs came from more modern issues, although......Maester Cressen certainly worried about them.Â

I don't get that either he pretty much told Tyrion he would drop his drawers and screw Lolys if that it was a choice between doing that and fighting the Mountain. I adore Bronn both book and series; he also names his child Tyrion just to piss off Cersei . That was rich!

LOL, I agree, I'm hopeful that ShowBronn will be the father himself now, it seems.Â  I think it was important, the naming, it was Bronn's way of saying he still did have some loyalty to Tyrion, maybe was glad he escaped, and it certainly served by pissing Cersei off.Â  Bronn's delivery is just a bit darker in the books, that's the main difference.Â  I love,too, that ShowBronn was the guy who could pronounce the name of the snooty author of that book.Â  That was a nice touch for the tv character, that and his explainations about what war is really like, sieges included.Â  I'm actually really surprised that Bronn did get the Lollys treatment already, as I was wondering if he'd accompany Jaime.Â  Still, I suppose Bronn could be part of Cersei's KL paranoia storyline now.Â  I don't ever complain about extra Bronn on the tv show.Â

1161	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-05-20	Have they called Prince Oberyn the Red Viper Â yet? Or have they mention anything about his knowledge of poisons?Â  there was a scene where Tywin was pretty much interrogating the Red Viper earlier in the season and he tells him that it's strange how someone with an extensive knowledge of poisons shows up to Kings Landing and the king dies of poison. This is the scene in question

Â 
If people who arent getting it are still watching the TV show is doing it's job.
Â 
That said, I think D & D are making things a lot clearer than in the past. If they make it too obvious there is no suspense.
Â 
Book readers certainly have to wait - sometimes several years/thousands of pages to know wth went on at many points.
Â 
There are more episodes coming up. As Michelle Fairley said - keep watching.
Â 
There ARE reviews out there to get background from and if people go there, then fine. I watched The Master and I am going to have to do a little Google to find out what the heck? Â Yet it was highly rated. I had to watch Memento a few times and take notes. People can survive a little subtlety and like some people on the forums can wait a week or so to see if confusing events are explained.
Â 
ETA: Roger Ebert seems to have had the same take on The Master as I did.


Â 
Â 
Yes, yes, getting ratings is their job. I meant that if you have to refer to reviews and episode recaps in order to understand what is going on, they are not doing their jobs in conveying the story to the audience.Â 
Â 
I think they do a good job. I watch with an "unsullied" and they can follow everything that's going on.Â
1166	Lesk	2014-05-20	At leastÂ they kept in the death from infected bite, even though with different characters. Vargo Hoat's earÂ by Brienne transferred to The Hounds neckÂ by Biter.
1167	Colonel Green	2014-05-20	Â 
I didn't like the way the line about Falyse was delivered (or the fact that it even existed)Â but for different reasons.Â  BookBronn is not the one who hurt Falyse, Cersei set all that in motion.


Bronn didn't kill Falyse in the end, but the line about an accident happening to her is from that scene in the book.

My point is that audiences might be OK with having to wait for all elements to be revealed, or to review previous episodes, or if not, to go to other sources.  The fact that non readers are watching supports that. In fact, no one wants to watch something with no mystery.
1170	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-20	Bronn didn't kill Falyse in the end, but the line about an accident happening to her is from that scene in the book.


Â 
I couldn't quite remember all the exact musings from Bronn in the book during his visit with Tyrion, but did think I posted that I thought he might have said something along those lines. Â For all the lightening up they do of Bronn (which doesn't bother me), the delivery of that line and the show using it just make me suspect that D&D might make things in the future at Stokeworth go down a certain way, that's my main issue with it, and with the way it was done. Â We'll see, they love Bronn on the show, as do I, maybe I'm worrying about nothing. Â I do have to admit, I wonder about Lady Tanda's 'fall' from the horse and the implication of a worn out strap, and how Bronn fits into it. Â But, the thing is, still, regardless of Tanda (who Bronn didn't need to get rid of, who he needed to get rid of was Falyse, so I hope Book Bronn IS innocent, I hope, LOL), I worry what that line says about the direction the show will move with the storyline points. Â That and their tendancy to whitewash Cersei is why it now has me worried, just a little. Â

Hmmmmmmm, that's actually a very interesting idea, but I can't see Sansa pulling that off, unless LF has already fed her the story behind the scenes. Â I can't guess where they are going with this Marillion (or a stand in for him) absence from the story. Â

Â 
Very confusing season. Â It has some amazing and powerful scenes and some truly weak crap too. Â Jon Snow and Dany are totally lame this season and I was thinking their stories would be better.

that is pretty on par with the books...injured during a fight, not an especially huge battle, wound festers and he dies....im totally with you on the secne being perfectly lame...but i think thats what they are going to do, basing it on the close-up of the wound and arya pushing the point about fire on the wound to avoid festering...i dont envision any huge battles coming up for the Hound...

make shit up...nothing else to do...GRRM's fault imo...lazy old coot shouldn't have green lit the show in 2011...should have pushed it till at least 2013, get additional 2 years to write the books...i mean seriously...if he took 5 yrs for AFFC and 6yr for ADwD, how the hell did he expect to finish AWoW and ADoS both in under 7 yrs....HBO doesn't make more than 8 season shows...it is known...

+1, as if The Books are sacrosanct & deviations from it constitute blasphemy.
The fact is, the show is superior to The Books in many ways concerning the plot, characterization, lines. Not every way of course, but many: showTyrion is better than bookTyrion, showTywin is better than bookTywin, showJorah better than bookJorah, the showWar of Five Kings evolved better than bookWar of Five Kings, showOthers are better than bookOthers, etc.
Then again, bookStannis is better than showStannis and the bookIron-born plot line is better than the showIron-born plot line.
They're two different pieces of art and one has no literary authenticity above the other.

jorah doesn't know that...he probably just heard that Tyrion killed Tywin so correctly assumes he hates Tywin...and who knows, maybe in the show Tyrion will talk Jorah out of killing him on the spot by saying he's willing to swear to Dany that Tywin set Jorah up and that he's "innocent"

I was thinking something similar. Seems she almost HAS to be his bastard and that would be a dramatic way of working that in. Not sure they would believe the jumping though. Maybe a struggle with Sansa?

would make sense from what they showed in the E08 Promo where sansa says "im sorry to say that Lord Baelish has lied to all of you" (or something along those lines)...the lie being that shes not her niece but her bastard...might work out pretty well...as soon as LF said "niece" instead of daughter, i was like "why...why would they change something so small...what could D&D possible have to gain by changing it to niece from daughter??"Â

Nonsense something that has filled in every single hole with plausible explanation completing a woven tapestery where every single piece of the puzzle fits to create an epic story? Which will undoubtedly last for centuries.
Â 
Then something which will only last a generation a fad of today gone tomorrow. Heck it can't even get the same awards twice. An adapatation at the very best containing more holes the siv, within almost every scene and picture shown?
Â 
For exmaple Stannis at the Iron bank he has just been loaned money to win all of Westeros but he goes rerecruits Slandor Saan instead of going to hire mercenariy companies to add to his depleted army.
Â 
What are the Nights Watch doing? They have Wildings rampaging over the wall an attack imenent, men to match this threat who will attack. But instead they are travelling 120 miles instead of the odd 30 to Mole Town to defeat these foes. Who won't attack them until they are all back home. The information of these stupid deserters won't put off any invading force at all. Pointless useless screen time to generate rape and barbism, make belief for Bran, all so Snow can have his Wolf back.
Â 
Asha Theon Bastard that whole line hasn't made any sense quite contrary to how most people would act in events shown.
Â 
So many many more. When adding some spoilers on information we haven't even read yet.
Â 
Barely coherent in most of the information shown as makes it up as it goes along often explained in some kind of hammy phallusy.
Â 
Yes it is a good show, it is not afraid to kill actors, who aren't builetprooof outside of that redeeming factor, and the hand made sets. It can get quite messy. But in no ways imagineable is it better then any book which will last lifetimes, having thought out every single detail and angle to achieve any written story

1190	Eddard the Builder	2014-05-20	Â 
LOL at the hubby. Â Yes, I was pleasantly surprised at the insta-pyscho. Â It does leave lots of promise for Sansa dealing with him now, too. Â I was worried that the show was going too Sweet with Robin. Â Perhaps it's about the age, too. Â Like Joffrey, he needs to be a bit of different type of brat. Â The kid is doing great with the role, too. Â He was terrific first season, but even without being around year after year like the other kids in the roles, he's doing great. Â He seemed like the same kid we met in the first season and it seemed effortless for him. Â Great job. Â 
Â 
On a side note, I was a little weirded out the other week about how much Robin seemed to like Uncle Petyr, I'll Â have to wait and see where that goes. Â 


When I saw that I was instantly reminded of Joff's trolling "Thank you Uncle, we all need wisdom now that the war is over....OMG A VALYRIAN STEEL SWORD! Â FUCK THAT! *SLICE*" Â I remember all my unsullied friends being like "Wait wut...Ah that's more like it."
1191	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-20	just re-watched the ep...liked it much more this time, did not have the expectation that each scene and every dialogue should be epic...

I have noticed that the show does go for the trolling approach with dialogue and actions like Joffrey in the scene you mentioned. Â It works well, sometimes really well. Â I love all of TVRoose's extra troll acts, too. Â

Agreed. He didn't say anything but I read that look it as him thinking about Tysha and almost telling Tyrion. I guess they have to save that for his release to get him very angry?

Â 
I do think they are saving Jaime's confession and truth telling for the last jailbreak scenes. Â That look, quick as it was though, seems to indicate that it's coming. Â Hell, look at all the book dialogue and rich guy clothes they gave to Bronn for their last scene. Â All these type of things add up to me thinking it will happen. Â Damn, NCW can act, I'm still amazed at all I read into that one look. Â I don't think it was my imagination or my wishful thinking, I try to keep my expectations manageable. Â
1196	Lady Stonestark	2014-05-20	No way Brienne and LS is happening this season. Â No absolute way. Â Despite Brienne wandering, significant things happen. Â If Brienne and LS happen this season, there is no screentime for Brienne until tWoW and aDoS. Â Unless D&D go into *future territory* tWoW next season with Brienne's arc, thereby giving away Jaime's arc.
Â 
Arya needs to not mercy-kill the Hound, Brienne and Pod need to get to the Quiet Isles for the black stallion and the gravedigger, and the discussion about Sansa, Gendry needs to be reintroduced... not happening this season.
Â 
LS revenge killing some Freys, I predict last scene cliffhanger of the season, right after the CotF and BR make their appearance.

1197	hedgeknight001	2014-05-20	Maybe Bran sees LS while looking through a tree?

Â 

GRRM sold the rights in 2007. That's right: 2007. The show's first season didn't air until 2011. So in addition to all the books published by 2007, GRRM had a four-year head start on the show, and even assuming a seven-season series with a final season airing in 2017, he had 10 years starting in 2007 to publish the remaining three books, and six years from the publication of ADWD to publish TWOW and ADOS.
Â 
If it hadn't taken so long to get the series to air in 2011, GRRM's situation would be even more dire. So nope, no sympathy here.

Martin, IMO, is becoming a "victim" of his own success. There's no valid defense for him; it is entirely his own fault that the show will catch up and most likely eclipse the books. He had half of ADwD already penned before he finished Feast and it still took him almost six years to finish dance. While I completely respect his absolute right to do whatever the hell he wants, which includes constantly updating us on all the random, weird shit he's into as well as how the Jets (lol) are doing, I wish he would just realize that he sort of owes it to his readers to finish the damn series, and preferably not by having a television show do it. The man's a brilliant writer but will never be one of the best the way he's gone about this.
Â 
I know the comparison is unfair since they're completely different but since LOTR is still brought up often (wrongly, I might add) when discussing ASoIaF, could you imagine if Tolkien pulled this kind of crap? Yes, his was a trilogy, not seven books and yes, they're shorter, but the man still produced one of the greatest works of all time in his three volumes in fifteen months. Amazing. Fellowship in July 1954, Towers in November, Return in October 1955.Â 


Â 
I mean its pretty inexcusable AGOTs and Clash were only 3 years apart then Storm 2 years after that. Â Feast and Dance took five and 6 years respectively and were of a far lesser cut than the original trilogy. Â So he needs to focus and bang these books out quickly. We should have had Winds by now, and then ADOS should be released in two years. Â

Exactly. While I enjoyed the political intrigue of Feast and Dance there were way too many lulls and subplots that will go nowhere that should have just been cut out to get to the important things. Way to many characters at this point and too many plotlines. I wish he would have just realized the folly of it all and made the series into five tremendous books. If GRRM decided today or a month ago or a year ago that TWoW would end the series and he just made it like 1,500 pages, combined it with the important stuff from ADoS and released it next year I'd be eternally grateful.Â 
Â 
As good as the HBO adaptation is, it's an adaptation. Like any other good work I want to read all the books first and then marvel at the adaptation. When the show eclipses the books even if not all the details are the same, as good as the books are they'll be tainted a bit. And that's an awfully sad thought.Â
1205	Jameson Snow	2014-05-20	Agreed. He didn't say anything but I read that look it as him thinking about Tysha and almost telling Tyrion. I guess they have to save that for his release to get him very angry?


Â Are non book readers familiar enough with the Tysha backstory for it to have an impact? I don't really remember how much they went into it in season 1, but I feel like it was a very brief mentioning. Any chance they make Jaime responsible for keeping Shae from departing KL and have that be his big betrayal of Tyrion? Definitely a sharp departure from his character, but after having him rape Cersei, I wouldn't put it past them to change things up.

1206	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-20	If The Hound simply gets an infection from Biter biting his neck and not some awesome battle, that will truly suck. Â Especially since Rogue and Biter's scene was perfectly lame. Â Why just 50 min. episodes? Â Over the course of the season that is 100 minutes we would get if they were 60 mins. long. Â Maybe have a battle with Sandor and Rogue and Biter? Â Maybe do more with Bran to push his importance more. Â Maybe do anything other than give us 10 episodes that are only 50 mins. long.
Â 
Very confusing season. Â It has some amazing and powerful scenes and some truly weak crap too. Â Jon Snow and Dany are totally lame this season and I was thinking their stories would be better.
Â 
I truly dread next season if they are already out of ideas in season 4. Â What they hell are they going to do for books 4 and 5 where not a whole hell of a lot happens? Â That's why I think they are dragging out the attack from Mance and the arrival of Stannis. Â Those will be next season. Â I think Lady Stoneheart will be next season too (if they don't cut her out). Â They would need to show some Dondarrion and Brotherhood Without Banners stuff, which I do not see happening this season at all.


I agree it has been semi hit or miss this season and it makes me worried about season 5. The only thing you have to consider, though, is that season 5 will most likely be comprised of all of books 4 and 5, whereas season 4 is pretty much the second half of book 3. Even though AFFC and ADWD have a lot of fluff I think that by combining them into 1 season, it will result in a lot more plot movement.Â
1207	rmholt	2014-05-20	I enjoy the show (and the books) by checking my expectations. It's fun to set them up as long as you can enjoy seeing what comes up that you didn't expect. GRRM isn't a victim or suffering nor are the viewers. He isn't detached from the show. First he was very careful to select the medium and the channel and to interrogate the show creators. They interact. He knows what happens all the way to the last line which last I heard has been written. So the show CANNOT outrun the books. GRRM will build and place his bricks with his usual care at his usual pace and the show will go on and if they are both excellent though not identical how is that not the best of both worlds? GRRM is a smart guy. He knows better than to put the rest of his life on hold or to rush the books.

If they include the S1 scene with Bronn and Shae where Tyrion talks about Tysha, even if he just says her name and what happened to her, in the "Previously On" I think they'll be able to pull it off. At least it will be planted in the viewer's mind and they still have to have some exchange between Jaime and Tyrion where they spill secrets, although Cersei's love-list is significantly lessened to just Lancel. I hope they find a way to work it in.

My expectations are fully checked-it's just fair criticism. The show will finish first. Yes, the show will include elements of Winds and Spring that haven't fully been fleshed out and are therefore rushed by GRRM. I wouldn't be surprised at all to learn that GRRM is entirely concentrating not on finishing either book but only finishing the main parts that need to be done to finish the show, which still-- while I'll appreciate it and don't doubt for a second that the adaptation will do a great job with that material--is a very sad notion.Â 
Â 
It's not sad that the reality now is that he won't get close to finishing probably either of the books before the show ends-it's sad that he put himself in that position, purposely, I might add, long ago.Â
1209	rmholt	2014-05-20	I think it would be sad to see his books rushed or the show degrade but I don't foresee that happening. I think it would be tragic if fans would rather he try to rush his writing and forego his own life which happens to include a megaton of fan interaction and fun. If he just stopped writing now, (forget the show) it's still a great yarn and there's still a nice body of work. Remember after all his TV writing this series was written without thought if budget and set constraints - any constraints really (yeah see how fast gold melts in a stewpot over a cook fire) that don't violate his rules and you could write extended short stories around several characters. We're already ahead. Everything we get is a gift.  YMMV
1210	Princess of Ice and Fire	2014-05-21	Yes it is certainly a massive wall that Martin is building and it takes discipline and humility to prune back so many great characters to actually complete the novels and meet publishing deadlines. 
Genius and ego are not enough.

i'm constantly amazed at the criticisms i read of nudity/sex and i rarely see anything written about violence/bloodshed... both violence and sex were a big part of this world, just accept itÂ 

Â 


Â 
Gratuitous violence - violence for violence sake - does bring about criticism. Â Its not as cliche as your... cliche criticism would indicate. Â I have, routinely, criticized gratuitous, meaningless violence. Â Â 
Â 
Such as Theon's gratuitous torture scenes - I said that after a while it was just "torture porn." Â And my criticism of the scene between Mel and Selayne was not that they showed Mel's boobs; I felt that the scene had no point. Â I thought (and still think, mind you) that everything done in those scenes could have been background to more important scenes involving characters we actually care about. Â I added that - hey- at least we saw Mel's boobs! Â The indication being that there was nothing worthwhile in the scene, unless you just like looking at boobs we have ... already seen! Â Much like the needless dialog, we also got needless boobs. Â 
Â 
This is not some sort of Puritan holiness from me. Â I have no problem with nudity. Â Here? Â I had a problem with the whole scene. Â

1214	A Man Is A Man	2014-05-21	Â I really don't see what the big deal is about the show finishing before the books. I think by now we can see that the show and the books are separate entities, with characters and events happening differently between them. After seven seasons or whatever, we will get the show version of ASOIAF, and eventually, 240 years from now, we will get the finished book versions. 
Â 
Â Both can be good, both can be separate and different from each other, and both can be enjoyed on their own terms.
1215	Vvornth	2014-05-21	Spoiler Ser Jorah Mormont, him remaining with Dany all this time is in my mind one of the biggest departures from the books. In the show Dany now has a capable advisor that prevents her from doing mistakes she while pile up in the books. Will Ser Jorah be dismissed at all and Tyrion just make his own merry way to Mereen?

Â 
Also anyone else getting as perplexed as I on how fast the Dany storyline is running compared to the rest of the show?
1216	Dipsy	2014-05-21	It is the coherence of the show to the books where the issue is. However must not be the fact the show started on unfinished content, and is partially filling in the blanks creating some gaps as the show progressess. Leaving out many characters, events some due to budgeting, some are script reasons, providing more air time to any lead characters.
Â 
The inaccuracy of events in particular this season when given example below. Some events this seaosn have lead to some spoilers. Some are becoming quite painful to watch. In the certain comments above blunt statements have been made. Saying that it is GRRM fault for not finishing his work, or that this TV show is better, because the story is more coherent. Agreed that the written story jumps about between its many characters, containing thousands of words to read thorough. These pages of text are often translated into a few seconds of TV air time when covering as example chapters on a battle or war, a skirmish etc. However more often it is the utter lack of descriptions on many details seen within the show that are further brought into question.
Â 
Can anybody tell me please, why these aren't considered as holes when expressed as coherent?
Â 
Stannis meets the Iron bank. The Iron bank loans money to Stannis to achieve total victory in Westeros, sit the Iron throne. Stannis after being granted a vast sum of money, but he doesn't recruit any more men. Particularly any sell swords, these sell swords of whom we have heard about in the show, from Westeros origins, as well as from Deanery's.The North really really needs Stannis it was seen in the flames. So instead Stannis re-recruiteds that same whoring pirate, who he had already hired previously. The Iron Bank lends Stannis the money. The reason for the loan being Stannis is a real straight edge, what he says he does. "Banker" go beg somewhere else, I have a finger for you. The Iron bank had never tried to press any payment from the current king Tommen and his council. Instead we were offered a ridiculous notion. The Lannisters are broke because they do not forge any more gold, the last nugget of their's, was mined out years ago. Are we from planet stupid, assuming that they actually farmed, minted their gold, not smelting the various irons to trade for gold? The realm and the realms council has not presently defualted on any sum's owed. A prior petition was ignored from Cersei, during the Battle of the Blackwater, a time of immediate war. if Vary's has little Bird's everywhere. You can bet your bottom dollar, that the Iron bank has twice as many debtors, being well aware of current events. Particularly which houses sit the King's council, the gold they produce between them, which taxes can be raised, what stores they have. However what was shown was not at all coherent to concepts. Rather some hammy pomp, a great speech on how to get a loan, if you have got really poor credit. Begging the obvious question of why. this information was necessary? The way this will play out, Stannis will likely give the money to the Night's Watch, for food and their upcoming crisis. Had this interaction come after King's Landing this Season's events, maybe it would have played out so much better? Why if Stannis has gold, doesn't he go somewhere else, hiring more men, not the North. The Flames are not reallyÂ  so relevant now? The ending war, take a wall at a time the furthest from the throne that will make the banker's real happy.
Â 
Asha/Theon/Bastard. Asha has been told to leave her brother Theon the halfbreed alone from her father king of the Ironborn. "Asha" Daddy please I reallys love my baby brother, he is missing his phallus, please really need to save his attachment. Anyhow. 50 hardest ironborn, real killers ever, go quest to rescue the eunuch. Dun Dun. Meanwhile back at the Dreadfort. "Roose" naughty naughty Bastard, what have you done, we needed him? I tell you to go take Moat Calin because I am the ruler of the norths I have been smuggled into White Harbour. We should have used it for profit first, Bastard, tried that already, so sold his most expenisest piece. Now he is my Reek. Theon present upon hearing all this information. Much later and the botched rescueee. The Bastard is having passionate sex for the first time in all his life, he normally is acquainted to extreme fetishism.Â  Asha and the army of Hardened Killers, kills to find Theon's sleeping quarters. But there is only one way into Theon'sÂ  cellar from a stairwell leading to all the caged mutts and Theon. Information commented on by her own Ironborn Killers. The mutts start barking nobody kills them, silencing their barking, alerting more guards. Meanwhile Theon has turned into Reek loosing all of his senses having the dreadforted stockholm syndrome. Asha decides not to knock the patient out. Untill he can be brought back to his senses, or hypnotise him until giving him the cure for his condtion, lack of phallus. The Bastard comes charging in shirtless having blood/wax smeared all over his chest before attempting to kill any Ironborn. Reeks has gone back to his cell and Asha can now magically escape from the only way into the cellar. Reek is now needed for Moat Calin.. The Bastard now coddles Reek, saying Reeek I need you to be Theon as your reward. What have I just watched? Dumb and dumbest.
Â 
Night's Watch. We saw a huge army of White Walkers attack the Fist of the Northmen, driving off the Night's Watch back to Castor's Keep. The army of White's has all but vanished, many Watch were killed during their escape. Leaving only a handful of later traitors back at Castor's. Jon Snow after climbing the wall escapes from his Wiildling compainions, rides a few miles to Castle Black. Information of what happened at Castor's coming to light from Samwell who managed to escape Castors. Killing the stupidest of monster ever with no real intelligence shown babbbbbbbbbbie gief babbbie. Information from Samwell is releated back to the brothers, who are now pissing their pants about the coming war with Mance. The Watch is worried, wanting to go and kill the traitors at Castors. Samwell sends Gilly to Mole Town to a brothel to stop any rape at Castle Black. But all the Borthers frequent that brothel anyway. Meanwhile the Wildings over the wall have been joined by some real cannibals, pillaging what is assumed as Mole Town. Leaving a boy to run and tell the Watch what has just happened. But instead the Bothers ignore this threat within walking distance of a child.Â  Riding to Castor's keep because the traitors demand the Watch's justice, and they are 60 miles away 60 miles back. These traitors if caught will give information about Castle Black. This information must be. How to climb a wall hand book? The fact all the other Castles along the wall are not in use? But we already knew this because Wildlings have been climbing the wall for years.The other castle's tunnels are sealed in, with a wildling climbing a wall, you would have thought they would have used a door first. Well they are Wildlings. But I get it, because the traitors will say how many men the Night's Watch have at Castle Black?Â  This information won't prevent the upcoming war, no matter what useless numbers are revealed. The cutthroat was such an epic character who got shafted in the back. Because he couldn't cut a hostage's throat whom was headlocked. Thankfully the best melee yet although within obvous error to the above. Jon gets his guard dog back, a dog that now attacks it's captors, when previously was all like good boy. Anyhow the Watch are now back at Castle Black all is well in the North when preparing for Mance. Now the other Wildling can attack Castle Black because Jon Snow and the wolf are home. Bran wanted to greet his brother but couldn't, Hodor wanted to say Hodor. The White's replenish their army from baby sacrifices.
Â 
Tell me Please? How this information remotely compares to any book read? It is like a really bad day in a cartoon.
Â 
I could write in so many many more sceens, but when this fantasy in TV is supposedly of the highest calibre? What can be said?

1217	rmholt	2014-05-21	I could write in so many many more sceens, but when this fantasy is supposedly of the highest calibre? What can be said?

I don't know what would make it OK for you but I still reread. I find the material I miss from the show is still there in the books.
We don't know what's going to happen next week. Some scenes don't seem to make sense. They might later.  Blackwater and the Lion and the Rose were quite different from the book but they were two of the best episodes. They were written by GRRM. So there's more than one way to tell this story, even by him. So many complaints are based on what people assume is going to happen in future episodes.
Some of the technical aspects of the show are groundbreaking. The construction of IceHenge was a feat on a level never before attempted. 
Still there are budget and other limitations. Some of the book passages are all in someone's head and must be transmitted some other way which isn't going to be as tidy in all cases. Or they might be left out. If scenes don't make sense, keep watching. Maybe it will work out.  
I've even seen complaints about the show not matching the books for scenes that are the truest to the books down to dialogue identical to the book. Sitting at the TV with a checklist we know now is going to be crazy-making.
1218	Dipsy	2014-05-21	What do you mean? Would make it Okay for me? If I am questioing some of the many incoherences, do you not consider many others would also be? Surely there are many Unsuilled of whom have been refered to, who are so amused by a misogyny of gratuitous themes when keeping themselves entertained, not questioining the entire pictures shown.
Â 
Not in complete relevance to my attempted humour made in the prior post. We don't know what will happen next week? Outside of the obvious way in which theatric's are employed, it is quite obvious to see where the sceens have been building, what the added content will bring to the eventual story of this season. No I do not know where the final eventual story leads Dream of Spring, neither can this season guarantee that either, because the fully written content has not been released as of yet. Some obviously has been ahead, why we have had some added spoilers developing. Being brought into the season, when building up to any later events. Although most can say what, any conclusion to this present season will likely offer to those readers suggested.
Â 
My clarity was to the holes developed, in particular to the prefab constructed to fill in their blanks.
Â 
Yes this show is great. A real treat to the fantasy genre, yes it does try. Also when massively epic to TV in general, where so many are employed within many roles, and no single role is utterly infallible. The sets, their settings and themes are truly amazing, wonderful to experience in the many surroundings offered.
Â 
Although despite this there have been inconsistencies listed, I could certainly name a few more. No this is not because I am a reader, although I do hold that advantage. Simply because those sceens suggested do not fit entirely into the information that they have offered. As I have tried to question. Some hasn't happened yet, but even so, has sometimes been with some flaws.

that is pretty on par with the books...injured during a fight, not an especially huge battle, wound festers and he dies....im totally with you on the secne being perfectly lame...but i think thats what they are going to do, basing it on the close-up of the wound and arya pushing the point about fire on the wound to avoid festering...i dont envision any huge battles coming up for the Hound...

make shit up...nothing else to do...GRRM's fault imo...lazy old coot shouldn't have green lit the show in 2011...should have pushed it till at least 2013, get additional 2 years to write the books...i mean seriously...if he took 5 yrs for AFFC and 6yr for ADwD, how the hell did he expect to finish AWoW and ADoS both in under 7 yrs....HBO doesn't make more than 8 season shows...it is known...

Â 
I think there are only 2 plausible explanations for this. One, the writers don't want her to be stuck in Essos for such a long time that viewers grow bored of her storyline and think she is never getting to Westeros. By moving up her storyline, it's very possible that next season could pass beyond her ADWD plot and get her to more interesting things. Showing Dany eating figs and asking for cushions doesn't make for good TV.The second explanation I would have is that perhaps her storyline has so many events that it needs to cover, so many things she needs to do, that it only makes sense for D&D to get through her plot line as quickly as possible. She has her whole rule Meereeen arc, meet Quentyn/Tyrion/Victarion and so on, Battle of Meereen, battle with Jhaqo- a long list of to-do's.
Â 
Of course, it's entirely possible that both of these things are true. Her ADWD storyline is too slow paced and boring for viewers, and she has a lot of content coming up for the show to cover.

1223	Dipsy	2014-05-21	Her acting is slightly somewhat medicore, often quite harsh within amounts of vehemence, maybe she is still assumed as the child queen a problem? Although now she should not have to overly prove her entitlements within more of her stately elegance and in subtley of her manner and charms.Â  She has so much to offer, but sometimes this can be seen to be forced or unnatural.
Â 
Undoubtedly there is a lot more to her story throughout the course of upcoming season to be added. Though from what we have seen of Meereen her throne room is tiny, not entirely capable of hosting much of a court. Her chambers are also quite tiny compared to her title. Her lack of handmaidens and some staff is dubious.
Â 
Vary's birds questioned in only possible explanation of future betrayal's. Though doubtfully as to plausible when fitting into his later roles? That information could have extended her screen time though other means. Jealously betrayal from within, when provding a richer storyline to her character this season. Her lack of handmaidens and some staff has left out other extentsions to her arc currently.
Â 
Who is to say how it all develops next season? More will be added, though some of what we have seen currently, could be considered as lacking

Â 
It would be sadder if the series were never to be finished by GRRM. Without it being completed he would face the same fate of Robert Jordon and the Wheel of Time. At best the series might be finished by another author. That would definately hurt GRRM's legacy, and if you think that a man in his sixties does not care about his legacy you are fooling yourself. At this rate the series will likely not be finished until GRRM is in his 70's. Yes he has a life outside of the series but his professional reputation is bound to the series.

I am curious...has a show ever before surpassed the writing of the books? Â It will truly suck for me if the show becomes a spoiler for the books but I will obviously have to suck it up and deal with it. Â 


Â 
i cant say if i've ever enjoyed a movie/show more than the books...i agree it would suck for the show going on it own path...who knows, maybe at that point all the book purists will start raving about how the shows last 2 seasons were better than the books...i doubt it thoughÂ

If by "surpass" you mean "come out before", it's not uncommon in Japanese anime adaptations of manga.

Â 
In my experience, anime is more likely to throw in a lot of filler or go on hiatus until the manga catches back up rather than moving beyond it. Â Or sometimes it just stops altogether.

OMG! Â That is so hysterical!
1234	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-05-21	Well your mileage may vary, I became a fan around 1980 when Sandkings was published. I wouldnt have cared if he never did anything again. Â 
Â 
He has written many other short stories, longer short stories, books, and book series.
Â 
The first 5 books are fine. Â When he finishes the books he plans I fully expect there will be unanswered questions. (one of them will still be Who is Coldhands.) and judging on past behavior he will answer such questions on panels, in interviews even via emails as he is extremely accessible to fans.
Â 
So should he keep writing further books in order to answer all those questions after the series officially ends? He wrote a history of the Westeros Dragons meant to be in the style of a maester and it certainly felt like a rather dull textbook to me.
Â 
He actually is responding to fan requests for more Dunk and Egg and more history of Westeros and IIUC he wasnt intending to get that involved. Even he doesnt know the answer to some questions, such as how did Jaqen end up in the dungeons. Often people ask questions that are answered in the books already.
Â 
Â 
Aside from the expertise of you and your friend there is competing evidence that he knows exactly what is going to happen but it still has to be written, Think it's easy? Why do you think everything hangs together so well? Dr Watson drove Holmes nuts by saying the solutions to mysteries were so obvious once they are explained. Â The books hang together so well because they have been subjected to hard work. That takes time. Â It is a favor to us that he isnt responding to fans wanting him to rush his work.
Â 
When we last saw all the characters they were all heading for one of several geographical points for big events. I imagine he knows his plans for them. Â Otherwise why send them there?
Â 
Â 
My money is against either, and speaking for myself this sort of comment is not appropriate. Â He doesnt read these forums but his friends and relatives might,.
Â 
Here's a post from one of the RTFM FAQ posts introducing the forum:
Â "What happens if the show catches up with the novels?Nothing. The executive producers have a broad sense of where GRRM intends the story to go, and can always ask him for more details. They're fully prepared and able to continue on on their own without new novels to guide them."
Â So you see this question has already been answered in this very forum.
Â 
Â 
As to whether he has gotten lazy or distracted he keeps providing us with chapters so he must be up to something.That's fine for you, but if he was purposely planning on not finishing the books (which I don't believe) then he would be a narcissist at best. And I didn't say he WAS lazy or distracted, just that if things are going to drag out it makes more sense that laziness or distraction were responsible not a master plan to achieve immortality at the expense of breaking readers' hearts.

Incredibly funny. The looks on some characters' faces are captured & captioned so perfectly! I couldn't stop laughing. Just lovely.
1238	Palladinho	2014-05-22	D@D have a rape and gruesome sex fetish. Which is sad because they end up putting unnecessary scenes into the show which taint it. We don't need a constant reminder that Oberyn Martel is 'dangerously sexy' every time he speaks.
Â 
And I wish they would give Stannis more Stannis scenes. If they're quite done screwing his character up, they should show him over battle plans, or giving orders or something of the sort; not just silently pacing letting Davos do all the talk. But yes, don't need Oberyn to always talk about sex.
1239	Dipsy	2014-05-22	I doubt this series will make up their own endings outside of author's express consent. Why wouldn't Winds of Winter be made into a double series? The same could be done with DWD, possibly further extending till 2017?
Â 
GRRM has plenty of time to finish, these absurb remarks on delay are irrelevant. Give him time to finish his within the top 5 of all time fantasy series.
Â 
I think most authour's set out, with a game plan, GRRM especially, he is a scriptwriter after all. Meaning he knows how endings, character arc's, will folliow into his universe, but filling in the blanks with interactions to all of the many details which then fit into the entire story, take a lot of hard worker. He was reportedly 3/4 written, now within editing?
Â 
I think any ending would be easier to write, if when tying all ending pieces together, had he had a game plan from the start, but don't quote me.
Â 
It might have also been money. A mean assumption. Release upon maximum demand for the win, a guranteed sell out to everyone involved. There was somekind of contract, undoubtedly, with a clause on how this all would progress. GRRM would be very hated if the show starts their seasons before his work is released. These minor spoilers within the show haven't affected too much of his literature, because within the show they haven't be seen as particularly important to the greater story involved. When still following mostly the same game plan. Having more added time for any leads involved, some budgeting, cutting out certain characters and events. Some assumptions to what follows: The White Walkers army of babies. HAHA
Â 
The show making up their own ending would have to be with the authour's express consent. If it does indeed catch him? There is still time yet, 2016, then 2 more seasons on WoW. A delay, when giving followers time to digest. If when releasing the final ending after a small seasonal delay. Speculation. Who knows?
Â 
Â 
The IMP, his trial was outstanding, acting of merit, to his skills of award winning calibre. However outside of his haircut, he has been slightly inconsistent throughout, moments of elation, followed by some unnatural glumness, which aren't quite as consistent to circumstances seen. Having more events this present season coming, fngers crossed. A very hard role to master, sympathy, especailly within the show's many changing events. Possibly certain excuse may have been, giving the many others their own chance to really shine. If when playing any roles that potentially, are not infallible, rather then them being caught up on contract issues or whatever else is their troubles, when attempting their best. Overall some inconsistency throughout this present season to certain events. As as show maintaining a massive global fan base, whose numbers aren't really dropping. Hopefully when having so many fans to continue until any final completion. Dubious wether merits will be awarded this season. TV is such a hard act to follow, so many many shows. Episodes to go untill this season's ending, though if for any wins. Speculation is a...... Quick run for your lives.

It's called opinion, and I think it's absolutely hysterical.Â  It also serves a purpose for Roose, putting Ramsey in his place.Â

I just though it was stupid and not particularly witty. I love Roose as well. 
I think a better example of his coldness is just the way he treats Theon. There is no compassion at all.

I know this really isn't the place for this, but...no offense, you seem in complete denial of what's going on...so get ready for GRRM to be "hated".
Â 
HBO will not delay or have a break between seasons. I guarantee it. I will bet you a hardcover copy of A Dream of Spring...there is a momentum behind the show, they're not going to derail that for GRRM to catch up. He's had 5 years to catch up (4 seasons and pre-production, so probably closer to 6 or 7 years since Dance was largely already written) and we don't even have a release date yet. D&D know GRRM catching up is a nonsensical notion at this point and they along with HBO are not going to entertain the thought. That's why they met with him...so they can figure out how to finish this up. GRRM is in total denial and wasting time with way too many peripheral projects.
Â 
At the very least Bran & Co, Brienne & Co and Sansa/Littlefinger will have plot next season that has not been written yet. Possibly Dany as well.
Â 
The show will pass the books by, believing otherwise at this point is delusional. GRRM's publishers let slip and then retracted that WoW was not going to be released until 2015...so if we're VERY lucky, it will be out before season 6 airs in 2016.
Sure, there's a Â possibility that an 8th season can be added if there's just too much going on to encompass in two seasons in the last two books. But season 6 will be material from Winds of Winter for the majority of the characters. 2017 would then be season 7 and 2018 a highly unlikely season 8. There is no way on earth GRRM will have a DoS out before then.

1242	Newstar	2014-05-22	On the show passing the books...this dilemma happens all the time in Japan, when popular ongoing comic book series ("manga") are adapted at the height of their popularity for TV in animated form ("anime"). Manga are published weekly or monthly. Manga are not so much like DC or Marvel comic books, which start a title and then keep it running indefinitely as long as it's popular and are more like Vertigo series like Y: The Last Man that have a planned beginning, a middle, and a conclusion regardless of popularity, although a few of them can go on for as long as 20 years and the more popular series often have dragged-out conclusions to milk the series for all it's worth. The TV folks want to strike while the iron is hot, so they'll start working on an adaptation even while the manga is still going on and hasn't been concluded yet. So what happens when the anime adaptation starts when the manga is still ongoing and isn't finished yet?
Â 
1. Manga already finished or finishes before the anime: Anime incorporates manga canon, is very faithful.
2. Anime only uses published manga story and is too short to adapt all of manga story (a 12-episode anime, e.g.), manga is ongoing: Anime only adapts a discrete chunk of the manga, showing part of the story, manga keeps on rolling.
3. Anime runs out of published manga story and is ongoing indefinitely, manga is ongoing: Anime uses non-manga "filler arcs" with enclosed new plots, giving the anime time to kill until there's fresh manga material available to adapt for the anime.
4. Anime runs out of published manga story and needs to conclude, manga is ongoing: Anime will deviate from the manga story to come up with a satisfactory ending.
Â 
Interestingly, there was a massively popular series called Fullmetal Alchemist where this problem arose. The FMA anime started up when the manga was still ongoing but was less than halfway through the total number of chapters that would be published (with chapters being published once a month). Predictably, the anime ran out of story, and so the anime deviated significantly from the manga and came up with its own back half of the plot and its own conclusion. A completely off-source, new animated movie was made using the anime canon.
Â 
Eventually, of course, the manga was about to be completed. So another anime was made (FMA: Brotherhood), remaking the entire series and from beginning to end adhering pretty strictly to manga canon (although the manga and the anime finished pretty close to one another, as I recall). They even used a number of the same voice actors for the characters.
Â 
So bringing that list back to ASOIAF, I've seen fans suggesting a #2 solution--D&D only adapting through the end of the published books--a #3 solution--D&D killing time, either with "filler arcs" (Robert's Rebellion) or with a hiatus--as well as a #4 solution: D&D deviate from the books and come up with a non-book ending to tie everything off nicely. However, D&D have specifically ruled out a hiatus, and they have also successfully demanded details on all the characters' post-ADWD plots, which would seem to rule out an intentional deviation in the event that GRRM is unable to finish the books in time (since if they were going to come up with their own ending, why would they need that information?). Nor can I see them marching up to the end of ADWD and saying "Oops, sorry guys, guess you're on your own." While there's a chance, albeit what seems like a remote one to me, that TWOW could be released prior to Season 5, I don't see any way ADOS gets released by the spring of 2018, which it would have to be to stay ahead of the eighth season if there are even eight seasons and not seven.

There is no way on earth GRRM will have a DoS out before then.


Â 
It probably has been written, years ago.
That is why D&D can take Arya's killing in TWOW and use it in the first episode because a lot of this stuff is finished and the show production team have access to it. When he wrote ADWD GRRM rewrote a Tyrion dream chapter 7 times then scrapped it and wrote theÂ Daznak's Pit scene from about 5 different POVs. This is what holds him up, a couple of problem characters, not the whole story. GRRM had most of Jon's stuff near enough done 10 years before the ADWD was released. It wouldn't surprise me if the characters who will go into TWOW territory in season 5 are also in this position. We know that GRRM had a chapter for Sansa which he moved to the next book and the battle for Meereen.
Also I am slightly more cynical than you in that I think there is a good chance that the release dates for future books will be timed to coincide with the show for marketing purposes. It wouldn't surprise me if the release date for TWOW is the week before season 5 starts.
1244	Newstar	2014-05-22	I'd like to attribute a lot more weight to Arya's TWOW killing finding its way into Season 4, since that means that D&D must have seen that chapter before the spring of 2013, when they were writing Season 4, but that Arya chapter has been languishing for a long time, much like the Sansa chapter. That doesn't speak to new material, just to very old material that was sitting around that hasn't found its way into the books yet.
Â 
Using the Arya chapter, or the bumped Sansa chapter, or the other bumped chapters from ADWD as evidence that "a lot of" TWOW stuff is finished makes no sense to me, as they are leftover chapters from ADWD. And if indeed GRRM had most of Jon's stuff done 10 years before ADWD's release, that's another indication there's not that much proximity in terms of time between GRRM finishing "a lot of stuff" on a novel and its completion and release.

					
					
							Edited by Newstar, 22 May 2014 - 08:38 AM.
1245	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-22	I don't doubt that a ton of stuff was written years ago, but whether it was or wasn't really doesn't matter.
Â 
If GRRM has every Jon chapter until the end completed, and for arguments sake, has writers block with Theon...yet knows his overall character arc...and has conveyed to D&D both characters overall arcs for show purposes...what does it matter if Jon is complete? Both characters are mapped out enough for the show, and only Jon/Arya etc being complete doesn't get a book out any faster.
Â 
Again, that publishers statement that disappeared from the net stated several years, no sooner than 2015...that doesn't really sound like it'll be out early spring before season 5.

1246	Dipsy	2014-05-22	I can't understand a word of that. I really don't want to try to decipher any of what he has said it would be like breaking the enigima machine. Here is a crack at that pot.
Â 
Imdb has put out postings with assumptions. These will likely change on what will be renewed by HBO. Because they have a demand presently. The season on display do not run the full course of the books, so why are they going to chop the last two books off any potential series, rather then further renew this show until completion.
Â 
Also separately because we only have assumption on renewal why can't that assumption further be extended to provide more cover strecthing DWD into another season?
Â 
HBO could be hated by everyone on the planet for cancelling a show that they haven't completed?
Â 
It is not unheard of for a show to have a seasonal break before returning to their market.
Â 
Most of what you said has made no sense at all. White habours wrath.
Â 
GRRM won't be hated because you say so. The book could be finished by 2016, realistically, in time for any HBO renewal. I seriously doubt that any content was written before, ahead, or in advance of this series. Except some prior knowledge of a potential game plan, possibly consisting of some knowledge into character arc's, endings. This still would not fit all the pieces into any story, when likely to change if those pieces didn't fit. This is why it takes years to write a good novel. There isn't any proof to suggest that the book was written in advance, in fact there is the opposite.There is a demand for this product, because it is gold, so you the above, assume greed is the motive? In your conspiracy based hypothetical assumption, of why we aren't yet reading an unpublished novel. Heck the simple answer is normally the correct one.
Â 
I had assumed a writer like GRRM would have some kind of game plan prior to setting out on such an epic undertaking. Meaning an ending would possibly be easier to write, when holding onto some knowledge of character arc's, endings. This is an assumption. Although meaning the last book might be releasedÂ  quicker then the others. Winds of Winter could be a real clincher cliffhanger you name it is going to be epic. HBO are renewed till 2016, so what is not suggest they make 3 season out a book or make DWD into 2 seasons? Further extending the TV seasons till 2019, If a seasonal break, Dream of Spring 2019Â  or 2020? Speculation is a........Angrier guy above

I apologises because I have speculated to the extent of probable. We can see renewings from HBO on season up until work that is written, which can be physically constructed into a TV series season. As logical it hasn't be renewed further otherwise this would be public knowledge because the Winds of Winter has not been released yet. If published in 2015 or 2016 HBO will likely renew further seasons, we the public would be made aware of this. 2015 next year there have been many expectations. However if it is not complete what is not to suggest DWD is extended into another season, although somewhat doubtfully?
Â 
I said GRRM would be hated if this show finalle an ending is conjured by HBO prior to anything that the authour has published. if upon HBO releasing a finalle before his work is published, well I would burn the books.
Â 
Which is why they haven't renewed publically extending their seasons past DWD yet

Also, you do realize HBO has said, in print this will go 7 seasons? That doesn't mean they couldn't add an extra 8th season....but they're not stretching this out until 2019. I guarantee that.


^^ thisÂ  Â
1251	Charlie Hustle	2014-05-22	Excellent episode, in my opinion.Â 
Â 
Best parts:
Â 
- Selyse and Melisandre dialogue. It seems Shireen will have a role to play in the future;
- Tyrion and Bronn dialogue;
- Tyrion and Oberyn speaking about how they met. Pity they didn't put the whole dialogue, when Oberyn tells Tyrion how he believes Tywin murdered Elia and her children to 'pay a debt', since Aerys chose Elia instead of Cersei to marry Rhaegar;
- Robin being Joffrey (I'll make those who bother me fly);
- Lysa Arryn flying (she was bothering me, so...).
Â 
Not so good:
Â 
- Dario Naharys. I don't think this Dario is as cocky as the other one. He just seems nice;
- New Mountain, who doesn't ride (or act, for all I can tell).
Â 
And, by the description of the next episodes on IMDB, I'd say Stannis is not going to reach the wall this season (Mance Rayder isn't in any of the previews so far), but we definetely will have Hazzea!


I stannis dont reach the wall, then the battle for the wall isnt going to happen. If im correct, he and his army is what saves them, right?

1253	rmholt	2014-05-22	I doubt this series will make up their own endings outside of author's express consent. Why wouldn't Winds of Winter be made into a double series? The same could be done with DWD, possibly further extending till 2017?
Â 
GRRM has plenty of time to finish, these absurb remarks on delay are irrelevant. Give him time to finish his within the top 5 of all time fantasy series.
Â 
I think most authour's set out, with a game plan, GRRM especially, he is a scriptwriter after all. Meaning he knows how endings, character arc's, will folliow into his universe, but filling in the blanks with interactions to all of the many details which then fit into the entire story, take a lot of hard worker. He was reportedly 3/4 written, now within editing?
Â 
I think any ending would be easier to write, if when tying all ending pieces together, had he had a game plan from the start, but don't quote me.
Â 
Â 
The show making up their own ending would have to be with the authour's express consent.
Â 
Â 
Â GRRM would be very hated if the show starts their seasons before his work is released.Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
I agree with this for the most part but have a few nitpicks:
Â 
GRRM is NOT a scriptwriter essentially. He started with stories and novels. The scriptwriting he did apparently he was pretty good at it but it isnt where he started by a long shot.
Â 
As to being "hated" if the series goes past the books, bull. People who hate him for that need to get lives.Â 
Â 
Â As the FAQ says:
Â 
"What happens if the show catches up with the novels?Nothing. The executive producers have a broad sense of where GRRM intends the story to go, and can always ask him for more details. They're fully prepared and able to continue on on their own without new novels to guide them."
Â 
I dont know that the conditions of the contract are available to anyone but the parties. He picked people who were committed to telling his story. They had to take a test! So I'm confident it will be told and the ending is essential. The guys who made "the Natural" totally changed the movie by changing the ending. Â GRRM screened these guys and they were already on board. So I am not worried about the ending or significant changes happening at all. Â They've bent over backward to follow the books.
1254	Dipsy	2014-05-22	Nothing is set in stone. That article was vague at best to create what papers do best. Hype, tension, tabloids, falsifying leaving out some of the facts. I think we will have a much better picture on release of the next book, possibly next year? To the bigger picture here. As far as I can read from that article posted, it is only speculation at this point. Leaving out some of the facts, a broad statement may have been issued, covering the producer's ass at that point. Speculating the source of any unpublished content.
Â 
Evidence yet has pointed to what has been released. Showing seasons up until 2016. In line with the published books. The 7th season has not been given a scheduled year, listed. Why would it have been? Later having WoW as a single season, when Storm of Swords has mostly been as 2. WoW is supposedly a longer book?
Â 
Vague remarks at best in that internet article previously posted. 7 kingdoms 7 seasons. Maybe he meant to say as doubtful, was 7 books 7 seasons? What about Esos, Dany, beyond the wall, etc. Pull the other one.
Â 
Â 
A small thought.
Â 
If any show writes in their own endings before any written publication is released. Even upon the author expression to desire. The authour is in effect, commiting suicide, to any of the intended literature written. No longer is that same literature holding place of merit, other then being as some fabricated script. The many variations, providing prepublished spoilers ahead of a publication, soiling all intended gains to potential literature.
Â 
A theatrical performance. Often only dress up at a fancy costume party for any of those involved, having the imaginarium mostly of being inside a box. Maybe that is the next Gen of generic media, when so are rued by TV. Yes a TV show can really pull it off for the most part. But unlike those words published, bringing their own sense of imgination and desire to any readers. What were we left with, but a script instead of a novel? Produced as an adaptation ahead of the publication. Accordingly to some the above postings, destoryed the readers fantasy, because through an adaptation was always going to be different to any literature.

The seventh season hasn't been "given a scheduled year" because the show hasn't been renewed for a seventh season.Â  The producers have on numerous occasions said seven seasons, maybe eight.Â  That's the limit.
1257	rmholt	2014-05-22	Amazon wont let me preorder TWOW so AFAIAC the release date is between now and infinity.
Â 
HBO has committed to two more seasons. AFAIAC this means there will be between two and infinity more seasons.

1258	Dipsy	2014-05-22	So we have just been arguing a lot of ass? Nobody can clarify, specifying, how many seasons are going to be made, or when infact the season finale will be released?Â  As I have stated previously.
Â 
English was never the spoken language here, being never read, only interpreted. Links to my comments posted, have only clarified what I had said from the start.
Â 
I do apologise for some speculation, on seasons leading past renewal, or the time of publication. "I had stated as speculation". I may have been naive to believe in the power of the pen, or not so greedy motives. The truth is literature will always fail if watched before read. No this doesn't create a new market of fan crazed hipsters, watching to read the books. Why read what you have already watched, or when spolied to what is differently been read?
Â 
HBO has committed to content, that has been published already, why wouldn't they have been?

To try and be as objective as possible, I cannot imagine the legal fallout if the show reveals the endgame before DOS is published. Â Wouldn't the publishers of the books all these years sue for an ungodly sum since many less millions of people will now purchase the books? Â Haven't the publishers and GRRM had this legally and officially included in the original contract (like a non-compete clause)? Â Wouldn't HBO consider this risk and potential loss?
Â 
Â 
Subjectively, I understand the essentially expired timeframe for the last two books to come out prior to S7. Â Unless GRRM has some secret curveball dual-release-faster-than-he-has-for-decades planned, we will have the latter stages of the story told to us by not-GRRM. Â This, to me will be extremely disappointing and bewildering how somebody could disregard their entire fanbase...
1260	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-22	Why read what you have watched? Are you serious?
Â 
That's a terrible way to look at things. Some kid that saw the Lord of the Rings movies should never read the books for the richness of the source material? Same thing with ASOIAF...someone who started with the show but then wants to go back and experience the written word should avoid it because he's watched the show?
Â 
I cant count the number of movies I have seen, that once I found out they were based on a book, went back and read the book later. Why is that any different than someone who's read the books first then watches the show...you already know how the story ends either way. It's two compeltely different mediums to enjoy.
Â 
You're really reaching on some of this stuff. I understand you want to book to finish first, everyone does. But that's just not realistic. Unless you have just started reading GRRM you know how slow he writes and how fast the show is moving. We can all speculate as much as we want, but there's reality and there's wishful thinking. They usually dont have the same results.

You may have missed it elsewhere, but the shows producers have met with Martin this spring and know everyone's character arcs/ends from the author himself. So HBO isn't in any legal danger of revealing anything.

Tolkien was released before any adaptation was, mostly before TV was even in colour. What Peter Jackson has done in humble opion, was relive through restablishing that literature. This has sparked some fury within certain circles on his latest creation the Hobbit. But nothing was ever spoiled for any readers ahead of time, because most had been reading children's stories, completing essay's, on his fantasy literature for generations. Prior to any gratuitous series..
Â 
Are you so stupid to assume that a TV series holds a candle to any literature published? When making readers want to read from watching, going out of their way to purchase a spoiled book, from a TV show showing the ending before any written work? Often when TV lasting only a generation before being some out of date DVD. When shown, watched, before the literature is published, destroying those readers gains..I agree we are in a new age of next Gen reality, where everything comes from a box. Creating squares who watch to read, rather then them diving into real page turners. But the point made is nobody will merit this with any actual status, if infact it has been spolied by watching it first.
Â 
In your statement you have no concept of what an actual book is. The joy of experiencing what the pictures from each word mean to each and every reader. These were only ever somebody other's dress up, to be spoiled prior to the novel publication. Why would you read any book upon knowing it's ending. Are you mad?
Â 
You haven't proved as fact, anything yet. HBO haven't provided their ending season yet. You have linked internet speculation. Can you assure me when the conclusions will be offered. When the finales will be made, on both the novel publication and ending season?

Â 
i agree with a lot of this...not to sound too geeky, but I read the Harry Potter books and saw the movies...the depth in the story in the books faaaar surpasses the movies...
Â 
for something like ASOIAF, yes i suppose knowing what comes next definitely spoils a lot of the suspense but i dont think thats any reason for not enjoying it at all...
Â 
infact i actually saw S1 before i read the book, I did not enjoy it any less knowing ned starks losing his head...i read the books then to see how different it was from the show...before i started reading them, i thought i would just read each book after each season finishes...but reading the first got me so hooked that i didn't stop till all 5 were over....then i re-read them again...
Â 
ever since i found out that there were 5yrs between ASOS and AFFC then 6 between AFFC and ADwD, i knew show is gona overtake the books...i'm definitely gona keep watching the show as it airs and then finally when the books come out, will re-read 1-5 again and then continue on to 6....7's probably gona be another 4-5 years from now....sorry to use the cliche...but the show must go onÂ

Not really "interesting".Â  They would have exclusive rights to the written works, but that wouldn't say anything about other media.

The series made you read the book? Shead a tear for the illiterate. Funny how season 1 followed the book chapter for chapter apart from the lenghty riverun conflict, when winning awards for that season. How it went on separate courses from there.

As nothing concrete has been proven outside speculation. I will naively hope that the world is a better place, not ruled by greed..

Â 
HBO have never said explictally when this show will end, when if any finale season would be. When that ending season will even be made. Having been renewed up until published content at this time, with a vague exception of a further season/s that have not been given any set air dates. Because the written work hasn't been released yet.
Â 
HBO haven't been given exculsive rights to the literature publised, breaching prior contracts from the publishers, whom having had those rights prior to any show. They have however signed an agreement with the author. Obviously speculated as exclusive and whatever other nonsense of knowing character arc's presumed yadda yadda make belief endings. The author is falling behind a deadline, prompting, so many absurd hypebole nonsense assumptions, quite laughably trolled.
Â 
I can't believe I fell foul to such ridiculous trolling when previously posting..

Linked with speculation from many undisclosed uncertified sources. Until the producers or authour verify explictally via a video interview or signed documents. Anybody can write in a bunch of crap. Go watch South Park, kids.......

1274	Dipsy	2014-05-23	You, above, have been trolling for the sake of it. Continue to do so. What are you above proving here? No I am not understanding why you, above, are being purely disruptive to this forum?
Â 
All you, above, have linked now is: The show may last 7 or 8 seasons. Okay I understood that I really do.
Â 
However what you, above, have not linked is when those 7 or 8 seasons will even be made.
Â 
You, above, have further assumed that gives HBO the exculsive rights to makeup their own ending, outside of any published ending. That is not entirely to say that any seasons won't end, go on a break, but they certainly won't be within ending spoilers to any published books. Troll off. The speculation you, above, are bringing to the table/forum is unverified assumptions, mostly that you, above, has been filling in the dots with, when still liable to change.
Â 
The spoliers we have seemed to have seen haven't exactly effected much, not the greater picture of any story, yet. Who knows by Season 6, with those other roads taken on the show? The gaps putty and prefab that have been constructed. But any seen this season haven't altered any real perception of how any ending will proceed. Not to be assumed as whatever make belief endings that you want this show to imagine in later seasons. What like, Dany and the pointy end, hahaha? Seriously ask yourself above, why do we even have spoiler based threads? If this show is now gonna wreck it for us, not the other way around?
Â 
Remember Harry Potter. The contact was made before the books were finished being published, a contract for an amount of films to be made. Did these films ever spoil the books? No because they wouldn't have been published if they had.
Â 
Pure hype and speculation. As you, above, cannot read properly what I have written, that is where the extent of your trouble is here. I don't want to fall foul to your trolls again either. I would love to continue reading and then watching this series enjoying them both, without any more stupid assumptions wrecking them for me..

Â 
not to make things worse by chiming in....
Â 
but if HBO does grant 8 seasons, which is very hopefully going to happen, that means finale is going to be 2018....they are no way they going to give gaps of a year or more between seasons, unless some central cast member suffers a severe injury or illness...
Â 
regarding "assuming HBO has exclusive right tos make their own ending", you can find several interviews with D&D clearly stating that if GRRM is not able to release the books in time, the show will take its own path. This does not give them "exclusive" rights, but GRRM and D&D have spoken, discussed and come to an agreement...
Â 
D&D are probably the only people besides GRRM himself who know how he's planning on ending the series...he wouldnt have shared that with them if he planned on stopping them while he finishes the books...
Â 
at this point, if you are continuing to hope that show will skip a year or 2 between seasons and will continue on till 2020 or 2025 or any future date, sorry to say that you are probably being a bit too optimistic.Â 
Â 
ofcourse i am not Melissandre to peer into the fires and glimpse the future...but going by several trends followed by the network, several interviews from both the author and the producers, i am making an educated and realistic guess....

1276	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-23	I can't believe we have an extra week of this

I'm watching Pascal's other work to get me through. Not the same.
The DeadNedHead was shocking, RW was bad but it was Oberyn - such an exciting and well developed character - that was my book-throwing moment.
Yay Amazon Prime anyway.

Also, you do realize HBO has said, in print this will go 7 seasons? That doesn't mean they couldn't add an extra 8th season....but they're not stretching this out until 2019. I guarantee that.


Â 
Yes yes and Yes. They did say that as long as the series makes MONEY and plenty of money for HBO they will have an 8th season.Â

1280	Dipsy	2014-05-23	Â 
not to make things worse by chiming in....
Â 
but if HBO does grant 8 seasons, which is very hopefully going to happen, that means finale is going to be 2018....they are no way they going to give gaps of a year or more between seasons, unless some central cast member suffers a severe injury or illness...
Â 
regarding "assuming HBO has exclusive right tos make their own ending", you can find several interviews with D&D clearly stating that if GRRM is not able to release the books in time, the show will take its own path. This does not give them "exclusive" rights, but GRRM and D&D have spoken, discussed and come to an agreement...
Â

Speculation nothing has been set in stone yet. What video interviews, all I have seen is assumption and speculation. The same information being republished since the start of the first season. Adding to hype, simply because the authour is falling behind current deadline. Then all the kids who didn't gets their xbox one have been complaining winter is coming.
Â 
HBO haven't said when those later seasons will get aired yet. They haven't be publically renewed to any air dates yet on those later season 7/8, or currently past 2016. We have seen heard of a supposed contract for changing material with a number of season being set around 7 now 8. Within any possibility it certainly wouldn't be the first production to have any seasonal breaks
Â 
The producers cannot guarantee anything yet. This show could always get axed, as in everybody stops watching because it has spoiled the books.
Â 
Continue happily speculating nonsense. There is still time for GRRM to release the next book before the show catches him. The final book sceptical. Lets hope GRRM kills off the TV show prior. They then come out with something so lame nobody ever watches their crap again. Is that what your saying?

1281	Newstar	2014-05-23	The producers cannot guarantee anything yet. This show could always get axed, as in everybody stops watching because it has spoiled the books.
Â 
If anything, I think the lure of the show spoiling the books would reel in more viewers, even those who never had any intention of reading the books to begin with. The spice of "forbidden" knowledge and all that. Even the purist book fans will likely be unable to resist; I can see them now gnashing their teeth as they engage in hate-watching, inexorably sucked in by their own desperate desire for knowing what happens next, hating the show for forcing them to compromise their fidelity to the books, hating themselves for their weakness, but drawn like moths to immolate themselves in the spoilery flames.

Â 
The showrunners have specifically ruled out any such hiatus, pointing to the kid actors growing up so rapidly. You can't put the kid actors growing on pause, sadly.
1282	7th-key	2014-05-23	A pause of two years for a TV Series? Sounds unimaginable to me. Might work for a sitcom, but not for a production and extended cast on the scale of GoT.

Â 
wow...
Â 
the only thing that makes any sort of sense in everything you said is "There is still time for GRRM to release the next book before the show catches him."Â 
Â 
if our speculating is nonsense then might i ask what are all the "STRONG FACTS" you are basing your views on?Â 
Â 
since you are sayingÂ 
1) show will pause and wait till GRRM finishes the books before continuing filming
2) somehow all the cast and show runners will just wait around for an indefinite number of years
3) HBO will suddenly cancel a show that has one of the biggest ratings in their history
4) for some mysterious reason, all the MILLIONs of viewers who have not read the books will suddenly decide to stop watching the show because the books haven't come out
5) and (my favourtie) GRRM will suddenly kill off a show that he's been working decades on to get aired
1284	Dipsy	2014-05-23	How many countless shows have had seasonal breaks most recently 24 which has been renewed again?
Â 
If anything the lack of rewards from futher seasons only clarifies the type of audience this show has reeled in, how it has gratuitously filled in those blanks. Leaving the prefab putty in wake of its own intended adaptations to storyline. I am sure that is really what everyone wants to be remembered for.
Â 
The lure of this show spoiling the books, makes for an epic read. No it makes for worthless toliet paper. No longer is it considered within any graveyard, hugo, booker prize. Infact it will now go down in history as a generic script. The rest of what has been said is just some mindless trolling opinion.
Â 
Please can we wait and see from established guaranteed sources atleast until after next year seasons, or when some more stable TV interviews from those certified sources have been made from all parties concerned. Not the same republished crap from starting season to hype and add more hype. Before this topic gets any uglier and these so notable posters, whom are trolls, make themselves look so much stupidier. Some on here are so opinionated they cannot fathom common sense, when thinking that they are infallible. A real pity for those who would like to try to enjoy both the books and the show without anything spoiled.

people have shown you over and over again links confirming new seasons. Enough already its been asked and answered to you over and over and yet you still find a need to insult other members here or did you not read any rules and simply started your keyboard warrior attack.Â 
Â 
1. It has been stated in many sources that that the writers/producers of the show have worked with GRRM closely he has told them an Ending already.
2. this is cable TV not Fox they aren't going to go on some hiatus and expect the fans to still be here fans are a fickle breed and move on at times.Â

have a little faith in non-readers; psst I think alot of them know Obeyrn's faith we've ruined it for them and if well he somehow "survives" they will have alot of angry readers to contend with even worse than when they created Robb's "wife"

nooo please! i want huuuuuge, ned stark beheading type reactions to Oberyn as well...it will be the one thing that makes it worth it....he's the first character whose being killed the same season he was introduced (after season 1) right?Â 
Â 
i'm having serious long/lengthy discussions with my unsullied friends about the possibilities of Tyrion and Oberyn teaming up and taking revenge on Tywin and Cersei....i told them how Oberyn was supposed to marry Cersei and Loras going to become Kingsguard

What you have just done is troll,Â  bravo at your intelligence.
Â 
1)They have entered an agreement seen on TV with the authour at the build up of the first season. Nothing new republished, Except more hysteria, recommends using the pointy end, because of a failing deadline
2)There is no published public material confirming additional seasons past 2016 as of yet. We have had the same story being republished over and over again of an agreement allowing the authors consent etc, allowing for certain speculative possibilty. Already known information from the first season aired. But nothing concrete yet on any future air dates of later season past 2016. Outside of the shows original course 7/7, now 8, what about 9 whatever infinity.....
3) Your last remark is nothing of note because you still haven't factualy proved the first 2 points outside of your intended speculation.
Â 
Fans if you could even call yourself one is understatement to your breed

Â 
I amazingly didn't have any book throwing tantrums, I more so..........from The Ned through the RW to Oberyn......would look at the words, say 'huh? what, did I read that right?'.......and go back and let it sink in.Â  I didn't read the books as they first came out (inspite of being a GRRM fan) but only did a few years ago, and I think that JK Rowling helped me with books and temper tantrums, LOLÂ  I spent two weeks after Order of the Phoenix having inapropriate and verbal outbursts suddenly that went like this:Â  Murdering WITCH!!!Â 
Â 
I was so busy waiting for Cat to stop whining, that I had no clue the RW was coming.Â  As I reread and look back now, I feel an idiot for not seeing it.Â  Lots of Cat's RW chapters have the ominous feeling of horror novels, as do some of Bran's BR chapters, IMO.Â  I think The Ned's death had me shell shocked and I was prepared from then on.
Â 
I haven't seen Pedro Pascal in anything else, but I've enjoyed him so much....I know I need the extra time before Oberyn's onscreen death.Â  Granted, I need something to occupy my free time the coming week, though.Â Â  Perhaps a bit of a reread or rewatch of something.Â

I hear that! Re Cat/depressed. She caused all her own problems - terrible insight - and that's why LS is such a downer vs Beric.
I didn't actually throw the book but I did have a moment.
Once one realizes GRRM can whip up a great character almost as fast as he can kill one, one is reassured. Still wish he'd stuck around.
I'm watching what I can with current subscriptions. So far he's made a charming bit part in Buffy TVS.
The DeadNedHead made me realize this wasn't just any story. I only picked up GOT bc I liked Sandkings so much I remembered the authors name & was looking for sth else decades later.

i was in shock for a while when Bran&Rickon were thought to be murdered...had to stop reading for a few days...

The Lion King in Dutch is hysterical because they also put them singing the songs in Dutch  I only know English but my husband is Dutch

Lucky Lady, and to bring it full circle and back on topic (since I'm great at going off topic and all over, LOL), the Dutch are making quite the showing on our screens.Â  ~wink~Â  Mine isn't Dutch, but he is a 6' 3" specimen, and we both have experience in the Dutch Caribbean.Â Â 
Â 
Now I'm wondering, does GoT have other language versions of The Rains of Castamere and Bear and The Maiden Fair?Â

I don't know about Bear and The Maiden Fair or about other countries but at least in Spain they don't have a spanish version of The Rains of Castamere. At the end of the PW the credits re accompanied by The Rains and they put it in english.
1314	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-23	I'm seeing a lot of Unsullied comments to the effect of "Oberyn is so awesome that GRRM's just going to kill him off." Well...they're not wrong...

I may give in someday, ASOIAF sat in my house for YEARS, four of the books, my bestfriend knew I already was a GRRM fan, but as I say, stubborn, LOL Â It took boredom and well, I needed the tradeback size, at least. Â Quite frankly, Harry Potter typeset ruined my eyes, I think, not age, no no no no no. Â I have to confess, though, I'm serious about the lack of interest in it. Â I watched a History Channel show about myths and authors, etc., most of the series about Greek, etc., but they did a LOTR episode, too. Â I watched that, was more interested in that than reading the books, though. Â

I think I'll try the Normal Heart. AIDS was just starting to show up in the Bay Area when I got there and looked deadly serious medically and politically there when I left. I then went to Salt Lake for med school & it was like resetting the clock backward. Then I went back to the front in Seattle for residency and fellowship. I lost a few friends and my patients broke my heart. I was actually treating patients one year post MD then radiology where you don't see a lot of patients. I can spot pneumocystis pneumonia on an X-ray across the room though and there were a lot.  My first training resident went into Infectious Disease specializing in HIV and he came out to the boonies here and dropped the bomb of efficacious retroviral therapy. Suddenly people stopped saying : we've lost Africa.  It was the horror of my generation.  Guys like Larry Kramer + AIDS are why homophobia is out and gay marriage is in.  Gay men had to get political to save their lives and their rights.

If you do watch the movies (not that you will, mind you!), watch the extended version...Â  Books are really good, they take you into a different world, makes you look at this one in a different way, like I suppose all good writing does.Â

Â 
Good Rant. Â I'm interested to see the movie as I came of age in the 80s in a small town, but on the East Coast not far from the cities. Â I remember this time well, even in preteens, I was always politically and socially aware. Â I'm very interested to see the movie, and it's amazing to think how much time has passed since the start of it, the nameless plague. Â So much has changed from the 80s, not all of it for the better. Â I'm afraid to think about how the political polarization of NOW could effect a problem like this arising in the present. Â Kind of a scary thought. Â

There was a Joffrey death to sorta make up for it I guess but yeah its going to leave a bunch of show watchers disappointed. I will say as a show watcher only until this season, I did love the shocking deaths of Ned/Robb/Catelyn... I mean it was obviously very sad to see them die but at the same time, I loved that shocking moment, something which almost no TV shows or even movies can do to you.Â

Â 
Thank you for that, I wasn't sure if I was confusing my memories of the books, especially with the first scene of Sam describing Hobb's cooking and Castle Black on the whole. Â 
Â 
I do remember the added scene now thanks to your help with refreshing my memory.
Â 
It's amazing how a little Hobb mention can cheer a fan up, LOL Â I wonder if they'll have his cooking apron in the ring during elections for Lord Commander. Â

Â 
Yes! Â This is all building very nicely, I like how they've streamlined the Castle Black story a little bit. Â Though my unsullied fellow-watcher is a little confused as to how it's taking Mance so long to take his army to the wall when they've been spied from Craster's Keep by Jon and the others, as well as Ygritte's merry band of Wildlings...I mean, how long were they supposed to be gone north of the wall and she still hasn't caught up with Jon?
Â 
Overall I was happy with a lot of the episode, especially the dialogue, as it was so true to the books. Â So much of it was so perfect, it was a delight to hear it spoken by the characters! Â I'm worried that the Oberyn storyline (which I am so looking forward to because Oberyn has been fantastically portrayed) might tip my sweet summer child over the edge, though, and he might never return (though he'll want to find out where our little Tyrion pops up next).
Â 
Now for the negatives, and I say this as a proud Irish woman, Aidan Gillan is absolutely bloody awful!!! Â Jesus, where is Littlefinger even supposed to be FROM at this stage?! Â And his creepiness is getting more pantomime by the day...really disappointed in his efforts in what should have been a fantastic scene. Â I thought it lacked a little something-something, and I felt a bit sorry for Sophie Turner, who turned in a bravosa performance, that she had to play up against his mincing bad-acting.
Â 
It also REALLY bothers me how straightforward they are being about Littlefinger's orchestration of the main movements throughout the 'game of thrones' - I liked that the books pretty much told you this was happening, but also left it open to a little interpretation because it sometimes seemed as though Littlefinger might just be over-inflating his own importance. Â Obviously there's no denying his and Lysa's scheming with Jon Arryn, but Joffrey's death seemed like it might have been a Tyrell push, and so it could still turn out that he was as much a pawn as a player in that situation. Â Of course the TV show has to leave a lot of the ambiguity to the sidelines and just deal in more straightforward situations, but it's still a little bit niggly...
Â 
I'm also not completely sold on the Brienne and Pod comedy show...Brienne is so earnest and serious in the books, she wants so much to serve honourably and memorably, and the TV show is selling her out a little bit.... Â However, the episode overall was pretty good, and I am loving the Hound/Arya dynamic as it has appeared onscreen (though I wish they didn't have Arya so much like an assassin, instead of a reluctant badass) - another separation I'm not looking forward to with my unsullied co-watcher, as he already wants a spin-off show featuring the two of them...

1349	Gheimhridh ag teacht	2014-05-25	How?Â  He was the one who spread tales of Joffrey's wickedness hoping to draw Olenna out.


Â 
Oh yeah, for sure. Â But Olenna's renowned throughout the kingdom as the Queen of Thorns for her savvy and her insightfulness (and ruthlessness)...and it seems to me she would have made it her business to be very aware of every variation on her granddaughter's route to the throne. Â I think she regretted the Renly situation a lot, because it was taken out of their hands (her son pushed for it too much, her grandson was in love with Renly, and then Renly was taken without any real battle or something tangible to hang on to), and she would never have allowed that to happen again. Â She's way too smart.
Â 
I agree that Littlefinger was hugely instrumental - he definitely hastened the situation, and presumably volunteered the subterfuge that led to Joffrey's death, but I think his cockiness at his own cunning will most certainly be his downfall, and his conviction that he's the main player in all of this is suspect. Â I don't doubt that he has a place in the game of thrones, but I doubt his OWN vision of his place in the game of thrones.
Â 
Does that make sense? Â  Â

1361	rmholt	2014-05-28	Drifting on the off week back into parts played in other shows by cast. Got through 3/4 of Zero Dark Thirty & looked on IMDb for a cast member and surprised to see Dillane in the cast. Even in retrospect not obvious. There's a little body language and an accent sneaks past once in a while but I wouldn't have seen it. So of course a bit of rewinding!
1362	EowynCarter	2014-05-29	Interestingly, there was a massively popular series called Fullmetal Alchemist where this problem arose. The FMA anime started up when the manga was still ongoing but was less than halfway through the total number of chapters that would be published (with chapters being published once a month). Predictably, the anime ran out of story, and so the anime deviated significantly from the manga and came up with its own back half of the plot and its own conclusion. A completely off-source, new animated movie was made using the anime canon.
Â 
Eventually, of course, the manga was about to be completed. So another anime was made (FMA: Brotherhood), remaking the entire series and from beginning to end adhering pretty strictly to manga canon (although the manga and the anime finished pretty close to one another, as I recall). They even used a number of the same voice actors for the characters.


Â 
And I watched the and of "brotherhood" before i read the mangas.Â 
Â 
So, spoilled the manga for sure, but, watching the anime without knowing what was going to happen was fun too 
Watching GOT as unsullied would be some change. (If that happens)
Â 
So back to topic.
Â 
What's the fuss with "only cat" ? Didn't even noticed the change, that line didn't it me when reading the books.
Â 
Tyrion still awesome.Â 
I don't know why people would think Brom betrayed Tyrion. It's more "I've risked my life enough for now" than a will to hurt / betray Tyrion.

I agree there was disappointment but no treachery
To some including me Only Cat was more poetic or powerful or something. The whole scene was one of Petyr's truly honest moments. I didn't go ballistic but preferred "only cat". I thought D&D really are trying to be clear for non readers and that choice is compatible if not a little overboard.

Not exactly...he figured out that Petyr meant to take Sansa with him, and then helped set up the Sansa-Loras marriage. Â Petyr found out, and responded by telling the Lannisters, who responded by marrying Sansa to Tyrion. Â Petyr then gave Ros to Joffrey for target practice as punishment, and then gave the "Chaos is a Ladder" speech to Varys before leaving (without Sansa) to the Vale. Â While Varys might suspect Petyr, he has no clue that Petyr came back for Sansa (nobody knew Dontos was working for Petyr, and Petyr parked his boat away from Kings Landing or any witnesses.

You made a comment about thinking that show Varys knew Petyr had Sansa based on something that happened in the show, and I explained that it had happened before Petyr left, and that at best Varys would remember Petyr *had wanted* Sansa, but Varys had foiled that plot a while ago.

1372	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-19	Nothing is Nothing - Arya Stark.
No shit sherlock.
1373	Queen of Whores	2014-05-19	- That Arya monologue about nothing.... my goodness was that cringeworthy. It tried way too hard to be pseudo-philosophical and deep, and just fell flat and failed.Â 
- Brienne seems too loud and snarky. I prefer the quiet and shy book!Brienne.Â 
- Tyrion isn't bitter enough yet. He still felt the need to be cracking little jokes with Jaime in his usual tone. Something needs to change, cause after episode 8 he's sitting out episode 9, and when we see him again in 10 he is gonna need to beÂ veryÂ different.
- The scene between Melisandre and Selyse was kind of pointless, apart from Carice's beautiful naked body. I would have much preferred a Stannis scene.Â 
- Jon's scene was pointless, apart from introducing Yarwyck. We get it, Alliser Thorne's an asshole.
Â 
But the worst offender of all....
Â 
Dany didn't go naked, and we didn't see the sex scene. Seriously HBO? You throw in so many pointless and gratuitous sex scenes that when one comes up that's actually relevant to the story and characters, you just essentially do a fade to black? Maybe it sounds a little pervy, but I was actually looking forward to seeing that scene. It's not as if the ladies would be annoyed either. We saw Daario take his stuff off. This episode was a very short 51 minutes, why not just include their sex scene to add another couple of minutes? Unlike the others it's actually relevant to the story and characters.Â 
Â 
Ok, I realize that last nitpick is a bit dumb, but oh well. A man can have his hopes.

HBO literally had one job. They had always to create sex scenes if there wasn't one. But when there could be a sex scene which actually affects the plot, no, they won't do it. It would be too useful! Really, what was the showmakers thinking. They show all that craster-raping but when there could be one consensual sex scene without whores they suddenly don't do it. Apparently they don't have any idea what they're doing.

Rorge and Biter.Â  On one hand, it is interesting the show dug up some villains from the past, but then quickly disposes of them because their attempt to take down Sandor was so totally amateurish.Â  Biter manages to teleport onto his back, but quickly gets his neck snapped.Â  Rorge was casually stabbed by Arya.Â  These weren't villains to chain up in a cage, but spanked.
Danaerys and Daario have no chemistry.Â  The way Danaerys commands Daario to disrobe sounds pretty much how a general orders his aide to fetch some paperwork.
The Mountain is a villain, but even Ramsay doesn't keep people chained up to practice his swordsmanship.Â  Because its horrible practice.Â  You might as well use goats.Â  Instead of having him kill unarmed peasants to show he's brutal, how about have him using his sword to chop down small trees to show off his ridiculous strength? Oberyn and Sandor pretty much covered his brutality with their monologues.
Mel takes a bath.Â  OK, the rest of my bullet points were nitpicks.Â  This is the scene I hated.Â  Melisandre is doing two things.Â  The first is appearing as a normal person to Selyse, who bathes and jokes.Â  The second is trying to advance Selyse's appreciation of R'hollorism.Â  These two things are completely contradictory.Â  No one preaches from a bath tub.Â  They at a bare minimum is a crate to stand on while fully clothed.Â  Most preachers of any faith dress up for the occasion by wearing symbolically powerful outfits, be it a mitre or a kippah.Â  So, we have Melisandre doing a very bad job at representing R'hollor.Â  Selyse went there to know why Shireen had to come with them.Â  Mel just seems to be taking Selyse for granted right now.Â  Which just make Mel look bad at her job.Â  I'm sure there are other reasons I hated this scene, but it just did not work for me.

Â 
"Call me Petyr!"
Â 
I laughed so hard.
1387	Roose Seal	2014-05-19	Nothing is nothing 
Eyrie scene was a bit underwhelming.
New!Mountain looks too nice and teddy-bearish

Â 
Yea, Ramsay also kindaÂ  does his sick shit out of sight as well, like hunting girls in the woods, this seemed to be taking place in the streets of kingslanding, probably somewhere near the famous petyr brothal? christ.
And who were they anyway, peasants, criminals? it wasn't explained at all, it was just him killing random people to show off how brutal he is.
If they are peasants and petty criminals wouldn't they be more likely to be sent to the wall, instead of being given to the mountain as target practice.
So much about the scene bothers me.

1390	SerMixalot	2014-05-19	Jon Snow could use those "criminals" at the wall.Â  Scene made NO sense.
1391	Ambria	2014-05-19	As I added in my edit, the wall would seem a much more viable choice for someone who is facing either death or a trial by combat against the mountain.
Â 
And wouldn't they have a champion to fight for them?
Â 
Also seems off how it was taking place in a capitol city in mid day,
It's bad practice simply put.
I wouldn't think Tywin would permit such a thing.
So you have to also assume it's happening without him knowing.
Blagh
1392	Bastard of Savolax	2014-05-19	It was an alright episode, but alas, as usual there were some glaring shortcomings, most of which have already been mentioned in this thread. I have to say though, the whole Rorge and Biter scene was so bad it actually made me snigger. I donÂ´t know if it was intended to be comedy, but thatÂ´s certainly how it ended up. In fact it was so bad that it became funny to the point of almost excusing its initial ridiculousness. Really bizarre.Â

1393	Greywolf2375	2014-05-19	- "your sister" v. "Only Cat"
- the effects apparently were taken up by Ghost being seen for 4 seconds
- Rorge/Biter...Rorge standing there like a post
- Hounds dagger after he jams it into the wounded guy - not deep enough for the motion he took/sound it made
- no giant breaking down the castle
- Dany/Daario having no chemistry
1394	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-05-19	I would have liked a single line similar to "...That's the heart... The gift of mercy to any man..." It would have added gravitas to The Hound's final scene...
1395	420faceless	2014-05-19	Jon Snow could use those "criminals" at the wall.Â  Scene made NO sense.



I agree, and also it's bad politics to which Tywin would likely not have agreed to as Hand, as he would have made use for them ie. Wall. Cersei has no power to make these sort of decisions at this point in time.
I also didn't like how Only Cat was handled, Lysa should have just slipped out the door instead of doing that overly dramatic scream, because she should have just been heartbroken and in shock at being played this this after she done so much for LF.
Â
1396	R'hllor the Fabulous	2014-05-19	I laughed every time Arya's sword went "SCHWIIIING!". It's sheathed in a small leather strap, what could possibly be making that sound?! Even normal scabbards don't go "SCHWIIIING!"
To make that sound the scabbard needs to be made out of metal. Which would be terrible for the sword and dull it every time you sheathe it.
Â 
Oh... whatever.
1397	zaphodbrx	2014-05-19	I have to say I have not much to nitpick about this episode because it is very similar to the books compared to last few episodes. Even the filler stuff like Dragonstone was okay. The nothing is nothing was stupid and Jon Snow knows nothing, but other than that it was great.
1398	Cas Stark	2014-05-19	I quite liked this episode. Â My minor complaints would be that Red Dress should be wearing her ruby and why not "only Cat"..if they think the audience is too stupid to remember who Cat is, they at least could have had him say "Your sister, only Cat". Â
1399	AZAXD	2014-05-19	-wanted "Only Cat" but I gueeeeeeess "Your sister" was safer for any idiots who might be like wait who? Far out.Â 
-I used to be okay with how Dany talked to Daario but it's getting old. And DAMMIT show them getting it on! This better not be because of Emilia's not wanting to appear naked anymore. C'MON.
-KHALEESI?! I tried telling myself Jorah is calling her this as a cute little throw back to when they first hung out but without knowing if that's true I'm just mad at the writers.
-Things escalated maybe a little too quickly between Sansa and Robin. Just a few more lines or something would've helped I think. (I'm so glad they kept the snow Winterfell though).
-Brienne just annoys me slightly for some reason... not sure what. Kind of hoping Pod will be saying "yes/no m' lady" a little less soon.
-Arya and that dying dude went on for too long I think. The "nothing is nothing" line was less cringey for me than when we first saw it in the Ice&Fire Foreshadowing but eh I dunno.
1400	ipsuel	2014-05-19	The 180 of Jon sealing the gates was a head-shaker but moreso for me, the Mountain scene.Â 
Â 
It was so bad for me that I literally giggled through the whole scene... Just terrible and silly and not at all remotely good.
1401	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-19	Dany didn't go naked, and we didn't see the sex scene. Seriously HBO? You throw in so many pointless and gratuitous sex scenes that when one comes up that's actually relevant to the story and characters, you just essentially do a fade to black? Maybe it sounds a little pervy, but I was actually looking forward to seeing that scene. It's not as if the ladies would be annoyed either. We saw Daario take his stuff off. This episode was a very short 51 minutes, why not just include their sex scene to add another couple of minutes? Unlike the others it's actually relevant to the story and characters.Â 
Â 
Ok, I realize that last nitpick is a bit dumb, but oh well. A man can have his hopes.


Â 
I think Emilia Clarke was the actress who said she wouldn't do any more nudity scenes.

Â 
A gratuitous nude scene is one thing, but this is supposed to be a super physical lustful relationship and we see nothing? Not a kiss or an embrace or anything? Â LOL, they must have zero chemistry in person as well as on screen.
1403	Fat Trell	2014-05-19	I love the new Mountain but the scene doesn't make any sense to me. That's the type of thing Gregor might have done in the Riverlands, away from Tywin. Not right under his watchful eye.
Didn't like Cersei stepping through gore and watching pure slaughter casually either. She's supposed to be squeamish.
Rorge and Biter was dumb. Two of the most fearsome characters in the books handled with more ease than Gregor took down those random peasants. They came off as drunks, not psychopaths.
Arya Stark, the fastest draw west of the Narrow Sea
Jon Snow is still a sullen boy. Throws a little tantrum when denied anything. Where is the growth? Odd choice having him argue for sealing the gates. Maybe Ser Alliser will take Donnel Noye's place and die in the tunnel.
Dany shows no emotion when suprised in her bedroom. Dany shows no emotion when having spontaneous sex. Dany doesn't emote when she admits mistakes. Dany is a block of angry, fireproof wood at this point.
I liked the scene but why does Oberyn need to either discuss or be in a brothel in every appearance?
Brienne is a jerk. All she does is belittle everyone she comes across. Why should anyone like her as a person? Can anyone see this character breaking down because she views herself as a disappointment to her father? Like Dany, there is no vulnerability in this portrayal. And, also like Dany, that takes away an essential element of characterization.
Sansa came off as a child. We still have no idea why anyone would ever like Littlefinger.
Are there still Wildlings south of the Wall? Is Bran alive?

BBM--It's hard to see how after that scene anyone can champion Emilia's acting range, she is indeed wooden in every scene now. Â So, she appears to be good when the scene actually calls for stoic/wooden....but her failings show in scenes like last night where her entire demeanor never changes from finding a guy in the bedroom, discussing whether to slaughter thousands of masters and getting ready for a new lover. Â
1405	Cat Alayne	2014-05-19	agreeing with those who were underwhelmed with the eyrie scene. because of the nature of the show It was never going to have the same impact as it did in the books, but i thought it would be treated as a more important moment. It was still a fantastic scene, but compared to Sansa's chapter it is nothing.
Â 
First of all it was too rushed. Part of the magic of the snowcastle was Sansa waking up and walking outside realising its snowing and dropping to her knees in a kind of trance. They could have conveyed the nostalgia and melancholic nature a bit more i think through the cinematography or perhaps had her talk about a sweet memory with Petyr or Robin. The transition scene between the kiss and Sansa entering the main hall was an awkward cut, and i missed the line about her saying there are no songs or whatever.Â 
Â 
Then with the Lysa bit, i wish they included the bit about the tansy, the complete betrayal from her own father was such an important of her character. I felt they could have lingered a bit longer in that scene too, just to build the tension a bit more.Â 
Â 
Then I thought the fall was a bit cheesy. First, the CGI was probably the worst i've on game of thrones in a while, and the scream didn't have the same impact as her shock and silence.Â 
Â 
I wasn't bothered, however with the 'your sister' change.Â 
Â 
PS the only reason i'm judging it so harshly is because its my favourite book scene

Summed up my thoughts about that scene very well.Â 
"Only cat" is a very iconic line, but compared to how the rest of the scene was handled, the change to "your sister"' really didn't seem that bad.
Snow Winterfell is one of the strongest and most emotional scenes in the entire series (at least for me). I realize it's hard to include the "I am stronger within the walls of winterfell" inner monologue but they could've lingered on that scene a bit more and conveyed the feeling by using a more nostalgic-sounding rendition of the Stark theme.Â 
The final scene also lacked punch, cause in the books that's when Lysa reveals everything about everything and you understand just how tragic a character she is.. only to have her entire world shattered with two words.

1409	Hangover of the Morning	2014-05-19	The Mountain has such a baby face and is not nearly as scary as in series 1.
1410	Veltigar	2014-05-19	Nitpicks:
Â 
1) Biter trying to bite Sandor (and really the whole 'nothing' speech. I see what they are trying to do, but it ain't working)
Â 
2) "Your sister" was bad enough, but the CGI was shitty
Â 
3) Emilia Clarke not wearing that second dress in all of her scenes
Â 
4) Not enough Hot Pie
Â 
5) Melissandre was just weird. Normally I don't complain about the nudity, but it just seemed strange here.
Â 
6) No Eyrie in the opening credits? But the dreadfort and Braavos were there? The credits really start to annoy me. I get that they keep showing WF, but they should change the others if they don't appear in the episode.
Â 
Â 


Â Dany shows no emotion when having spontaneous sex.Â 


Do we even know if they had sex? I get that it was implied, but she could have had Daario strud around in the nude there.

No Eyrie, last seen season one.O yes, no Dragonstone either.In fact it seems they have a 'canned' title sequence , no more innovation.Money problems?

1412	Kungsmurfen	2014-05-19	Lysa's moondoor fall was anti climatic to me. I was expecting more from that but I was sure they were gonna mess it up
Â 
I thought it was just as disappointing as the book version.
1413	PatrickStormborn	2014-05-19	The whole Jorah/Dany/Yunkai business was really stupid. Dany already gave them a chance to live back in season 3 - "I have a gift for you as well. Your life ... And the lives of your 'Wise Masters', but I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai ... Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
Â 
They took the gift and then went back on her deal. And now Jorah wants her to give them another chance? It just shows me - once again - that the writers don't have a great understanding of the source material. Dany's problem ISN'T that she was too ruthless - the problem is that crucifying 163 Great Masters was ineffective because it didn't change the power structure in Meereen, it just further antagonised the slavers. And now they're presenting Dany's mercy to the Wise Masters of Yunkai as a good idea? No experienced leader would have crucified 163 Great Masters, true, but no leader worth following would give the Wise Masters a second chance of mercy.Â 
Â 
They've just made Dany look totally stupid for some reason. In the books she was naive, inexperienced and idealistic, yes, but never stupid.
Â 
I don't know why I even put this in the "nitpick" thread. It's three seasons' worth of mischaracterisation culminating in terrible decision and after terrible decision on behalf of the writers. In fact, they're making a bigger mess of Meereen than Dany herself did.
Â 
And before anyone jumps in and says something inane like "OMG they totes understand the material", I'm gonna stress that no, they seriously don't. They've probably read ADwD what - once, twice, maybe three times at a push? I've certainly read Dany's chapters more than that, and I've engaged in discussions about her arc in that book for almost 3 years now(!), and still there's no general consensus about what happened in her arc: some think she becomes basically a substitute Harpy; some think she was completely ineffective in dealing with the slavers; some think she was ineffective but also too cruel; some think she should have never turned to Slaver's Bay in the first place; some think she was motivated purely by greed; some think she's heading towards madness; some think she wasn't ruthless enough; some think she just lacked foresight...
Â 
I could continue, but I won't. The bottom line is that D&D are not conveying any of this. The message they're sending us is that Dany is being too harsh on the slavers. And what's their reasoning for this? Jorah's "I would be dead too under your command"? There's simply no logic to that! Jorah sold slaves once; under Dany's rule he may be dead, but most likely (like the majority of the slavers), he would have been given a second chance. If Ned had pardoned Jorah and he had betrayed that by selling slaves again, does anyone honestly think Ned would give him a second chance at mercy?
Â 
And this is further proof that D&D are just not comparable to GRRM, who makes the reader question Dany's actions without trying to sell to us the idea that slavery is a crime that can be forgiven. Tyrion's master, for example, is a fair enough man; he wants to respect the peace with Daenerys and he doesn't particularly mistreat Tyrion, Penny or Jorah; in fact, some of his slaves even like him! But GRRM makes him (and some other slavers) complex and grey without turning Dany into Viserys.
Â 
(And let's be real, a lot of this could be avoided if the writing staff and production team was more diverse. Instead it's a bunch of straight white men who probably all have the same opinions on the story.)

1414	Hangover of the Morning	2014-05-19	Loved the episode but the Danny/Daario scene was boring, pointless and lacked any chemistry between the two. I didn't care much about the old Daario but at least he was memorable, the new guy is just meh and totally unimpressive. Danny/Jorah was good but wished we had a kiss between the two. But I understand that they already had one elderly creep trying to force himself on teenage girl in that episode so poor Ser Friendzone will have to wait.

One of whom was responsible for X-Men origins: Wolverine. I think that says it all.
1416	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-05-19	I'm usually really hard on the episodes & in general really enjoyed this one. I'm also usually a HUGE Dany fan though & that is what I hated about this episode. 
"Take off your clothes" how RI-DIC-U-LOUS!
Emilia Clarke is gorgeous but she has got to get more emotions than the "I am the blood of the dragon do as I command spoiled brat used to getting what I want" tone.
1417	David Selig	2014-05-19	Nothing is nothing conversation with dead guy ( UGH )
Â 
Rorge just stands there and lets Arya stab him ( FAIL )


This so much. WTF was this?
Â 
And what was with Biter appearing out of nowhere and jumping on the Hound's back? Such a stupid scene. How the hell were these two able to sneak up on Arya and the Hound?
Â 
Everything in Meereen was just stupid.Â  It really seems that the writers have no clue what to do with this plotline.
Â 
How old is Robin supposed to be? 12? He seems way too old for the way he is behaving, above and beyond what just being really spoiled can explain.
1418	AegonVI_rules	2014-05-19	In the run up to this episode, people were complaining about how having "Only Cat" here, not in ep 10, ruined the whole thing in the books where it comes right before the Epilogue and Stoneheart.
Â 
It seems like they don't care about such things: we had Brienne and Pod talking about Sansa maybe being in the Vale and, after another scene*, we see Sansa at the Eyrie. It was such a blatant cut to have. Just really poor editing there (likewise Meereen - even if we aren't going to see Dany and Daario doing it, both the cut from it, and the cut back to the morning after, were bad - simply jarring) to stick another scene in between,
Â 
Season 4 has been full of nonsense additions that have (rightly) wound book readers up. This episode was better, but the Brienne plot takes a big kick in the nuts here - not only do they know about Ayra and the Hound without spending half a season walking around the Riverlands (many book readers rejoice, I guess) - she's a long way through her Feast stuff now, especially with Rorge and Biter dead, despite only an episode on the road. They'll have to make up different filler for her now, which will struggle to be as good as GRRMs!
Â 
Plus, who can Petyr blame for Lysa's death? the Eyrie has been empty (we've not even seen a servant) and Petyr needs a scapegoat or will lose his control over the Vale. He's not going to blame Sansa, who is clearly replacing Cat in his affections, is he? Blame Robin, perhaps - they have made him a one-note character who likes to see people fly (and replaced illness with spoiltness) after all.
Â 
Other than being poorly produced, and leaving some issues with how to go forwards, this was a good episode overall. Well, a good episode for season 4 at least!
Â 
*The excellent one with the Imp and the Viper, which was far more climatic than the Vale ended up being - could it have been shifted to the end due to actually packing a punch?

1420	Muggle	2014-05-19	Pretty sure i read in an interview emilia clarke, told hbo she refuses to do any more nude scenes. that she wants to be remembered for her acting bringing the character of dany alive. not just being known as that white hair girl who got naked a lot on the show.Â

1421	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-19	Arya channeling Rust Cohle. What the hell was that "nothing is nothing" line?
Â 
Everything Biter and Rorge. For us book readers kind of make sense to have Biter bite Sandor because he's...you know, Biter. But it just looked stupid from a non-reader perspective. Like, why not stab him or something? And Arya killing Rorge was a bit cheap/easy/hollywoodish
Â 
Speaking of Biter and Rorge, they had more chemistry than Dany and Daario. Also, the timing for that hook-up was weird

I am dispointed the Really Good directors they have don't seem to put their foot down about some things.


Â 
I don't think Vanessa Taylor had read the books, had she? So her opinion of the characters would have been based on a far more limited understanding of the text, but primarily based on D&D's own interpretations of the characters. In contrast, Bryan Cogman is a huge fan of the books, something which usually manifests itself in his episodes.Â 
Â 
Obviously the lack of female writers is a huge problem, but just adding a token white woman to the writing staff didn't fix the problems in seasons two and three. They really need a bigger writing staff of at least six writers IMO, with D&D writing just the premiere and the finale instead of writing seven episodes and directing one (particularly as they also make significant alterations to the few episodes they don't write). I can't think of any other TV shows where the showrunner(s) dominate the writing of episodes to this extent... I know that Mad Men showrunner Matthew Weiner writes a lot of episodes per season, but most of them are in collaboration with another writer (suggesting he perhaps took more of a backseat role) - for the sixth season, as an example, he collaborated with 8 different writers, half of whom were women.Â 
Â 
Basically, I think most of the problems with this show are the result of this (and I think I'm being generous to the showrunners here!). It just feels like the writers are all pretty much in sync with the characterisation of the main characters, which just leads to stagnant characterisation and poor writing. The only time I feel like there's added nuance from the characters is in a Bryan Cogman or GRRM episode. They need someone who would say "No, [x] would never talk like this in the books" or "No, this may be a valid line for book-[x], but it doesn't fit with the character progression we've shown up till now". And they definitely need someone who says "Okay, this is just terrible" - and I'm thinking of Melisandre right here. She's supposed to be this other-wordly religious figure, a prophet, a shadowbinder, an ex-slave, and most importantly she's probably a zombie who has lived for a long time... and yet they present her as pretty much just a slightly extraordinary woman; she takes baths, strolls around naked, tells jokes, feels tense at dinner with Stannis and Selyse, etc... There's no sense of gravitas there.Â
1424	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-05-19	My only real nitpick was how fake Lysa going out the moon door looked. I'm used to far better SFX from this show.


Â 
This is my major complaint too, it was really low-budget. She looked tiny even after just being pushed out. If you go back and watch Tyrion's trial in the Vale, the effect of Vardis going out of the Moon Door was MUCH better. Did the effects team run out of money or something?
1425	Sigrunn	2014-05-19	Arya's philosophy
Clegane. The mass slaughter was pointless; plus that the actor is too pleasant-looking for a character who's known for being a savage of low cunning
The Dragonstone filler. I'm glad I'm not invested in Stannis' character. Oh dear, what treatment he receives...
Rorge and Bitter. They appeared out of nowhere and died too quickly
1426	eumaies	2014-05-19	Some good critiques of one of the less painful episodes of the season.
Â 
I'm suprised nobody else minded Petry's apparent (According to the inside the episode interview) spur of the moment kissing sansa and killing lysa.Â  The whole beauty of it in the books is that he's calculated it so carefully and manipulatively.Â 
Â 
Also, the Viper continues to be cast as a hopeless middle-aged romantic.Â  If he could've actually discussed bringing Tyrion with him to Dorne and maybe crowning Myrcella... that would be evidence of a strategic deadly mind who plans to get something substantive out of his duel in addition to the pleasure of killing the mountain.Â  But no.Â 
Â 
Even at their best, D&D kind of miss the good stuff.

She's supposed to be this other-wordly religious figure, a prophet, a shadowbinder, an ex-slave, and most importantly she's probably a zombie who has lived for a long time... and yet they present her as pretty much just a slightly extraordinary woman; she takes baths, strolls around naked, tells jokes, feels tense at dinner with Stannis and Selyse, etc... There's no sense of gravitas there.Â

1428	Aethermancer	2014-05-19	As I added in my edit, the wall would seem a much more viable choice for someone who is facing either death or a trial by combat against the mountain.
Â 
And wouldn't they have a champion to fight for them?
Â 


Generally, trial by combat is a nobility thing.Â  Not something offered to lowborn.
Â 
However, assuming that was the case and they did try it as a last ditch effort:Â  You don't get assigned champions, you must have a volunteer.Â Â  If Oberyn didn't volunteer for Tyrion, it would be Tyrion that would be facing the Mountain.

1429	David Selig	2014-05-19	Some good critiques of one of the less painful episodes of the season.
Â 
I'm suprised nobody else minded Petry's apparent (According to the inside the episode interview) spur of the moment kissing sansa and killing lysa.Â  The whole beauty of it in the books is that he's calculated it so carefully and manipulatively.Â 


Nope, it was impulsive in the books too.
1430	TheFullmetalAlchemist	2014-05-19	The Mountain looks like a cuddly teddy bear. Brienne has a bad attitude with pretty much everyone, which makes her pretty unlikable. The cutting of the "only Cat" line was unnecessary. Rorge and Biter just appearing out of nowhere was downright comical. The Sansa snow scene was rushed.Â 
Â 
Those were my issues with the ep. The rest was fine.Â
1431	Arkash	2014-05-19	Where the hell are the Eyrie in the credit ?
1432	Bori	2014-05-19	Everything Biter and Rorge. For us book readers kind of make sense to have Biter bite Sandor because he's...you know, Biter. But it just looked stupid from a non-reader perspective. Like, why not stab him or something? And Arya killing Rorge was a bit cheap/easy/hollywoodish

  Moreover, if they were hiding there for this long they surely heard Arya introducing herself (which, by the way, she didn't used to do). I know that they supposed to be dull-witted but even they should know that the Stark girl worth more than the Hound...
Â 
And yes, I'm one of the few, who actually missed the "Only Cat". I was sitting there, rubbing my hands, expecting, expecting, and...no. Maybe it's a trade mark of HBO. They did the same thing in Rome when Caesar was killed and everybody waiting for his famous last sentence about Brutus...but no.
1433	Aethermancer	2014-05-19	The whole Jorah/Dany/Yunkai business was really stupid. Dany already gave them a chance to live back in season 3 - "I have a gift for you as well. Your life ... And the lives of your 'Wise Masters', but I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai ... Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
Â 
They took the gift and then went back on her deal.
Â 
Â 
...(snip)...
Â 
I could continue, but I won't. The bottom line is that D&D are not conveying any of this. The message they're sending us is that Dany is being too harsh on the slavers. And what's their reasoning for this? Jorah's "I would be dead too under your command"? There's simply no logic to that! Jorah sold slaves once; under Dany's rule he may be dead, but most likely (like the majority of the slavers), he would have been given a second chance. If Ned had pardoned Jorah and he had betrayed that by selling slaves again, does anyone honestly think Ned would give him a second chance at mercy?


Â 
Â 
No, they did exactly as she requested (in the books as well).Â  They opened their gates and released every slave in Yunkai.Â  Dany then rode off for Mereen.Â  Yunkai just acquired more slaves after she left.Â  Imagine Dany going to a bank and saying, "Zero out everyone's debt, or else!"Â  So the bank goes and zeroes everyone's debt.Â Â  Then later, someone takes a loan from them.Â  Dany never said stop being slavers, just turn over all your slaves to me.
Â 
In short: Dany never outlawed slavery.Â  She never conquered Yunkai, she demanded tribute in the form of slaves, which she later freed.

1434	Brother Walfrid	2014-05-19	I'm usually really hard on the episodes & in general really enjoyed this one. I'm also usually a HUGE Dany fan though & that is what I hated about this episode.
"Take off your clothes" how RI-DIC-U-LOUS!
Emilia Clarke is gorgeous but she has got to get more emotions than the "I am the blood of the dragon do as I command spoiled brat used to getting what I want" tone.


Would you have preferred "I am your queen, and I command you to fuck me"
1435	of man and wolf	2014-05-19	- That Arya monologue about nothing.... my goodness was that cringeworthy. It tried way too hard to be pseudo-philosophical and deep, and just fell flat and failed.Â 
- Brienne seems too loud and snarky. I prefer the quiet and shy book!Brienne.Â 
- Tyrion isn't bitter enough yet. He still felt the need to be cracking little jokes with Jaime in his usual tone. Something needs to change, cause after episode 8 he's sitting out episode 9, and when we see him again in 10 he is gonna need to beÂ veryÂ different.
- The scene between Melisandre and Selyse was kind of pointless, apart from Carice's beautiful naked body. I would have much preferred a Stannis scene.Â 
- Jon's scene was pointless, apart from introducing Yarwyck. We get it, Alliser Thorne's an asshole.
Â 
But the worst offender of all....
Â 
Dany didn't go naked, and we didn't see the sex scene. Seriously HBO? You throw in so many pointless and gratuitous sex scenes that when one comes up that's actually relevant to the story and characters, you just essentially do a fade to black? Maybe it sounds a little pervy, but I was actually looking forward to seeing that scene. It's not as if the ladies would be annoyed either. We saw Daario take his stuff off. This episode was a very short 51 minutes, why not just include their sex scene to add another couple of minutes? Unlike the others it's actually relevant to the story and characters.Â 
Â 
Ok, I realize that last nitpick is a bit dumb, but oh well. A man can have his hopes.


I believe I read somewhere that dany is done getting nude for the show. Emilia I should say.
1436	PatrickStormborn	2014-05-19	Â 
Â 
No, they did exactly as she requested (in the books as well).Â  They opened their gates and released every slave in Yunkai.Â  Dany then rode off for Mereen.Â  Yunkai just acquired more slaves after she left.Â  Imagine Dany going to a bank and saying, "Zero out everyone's debt, or else!"Â  So the bank goes and zeroes everyone's debt.Â Â  Then later, someone takes a loan from them.Â  Dany never said stop being slavers, just turn over all your slaves to me.


Â 
She told them to release the slaves, which they did. But then they resumed slavery immediately after she left and re-enslaved those they had freed. I'm sure they were very well aware that this was a rejection of Dany's "gift" to them.
1437	Jamie Lannister	2014-05-19	I admittedly can't remember how exactly it went down in the book, but Sansa seemed unduly bitchy with Sweet Robin. I mean, he accidentally knocks over a little snow tower, apologizes and says they can rebuild it, and she completely flips her shit? Didn't he flail in destroying things left and right before she actually lost her temper?
1438	of man and wolf	2014-05-19	The whole Jorah/Dany/Yunkai business was really stupid. Dany already gave them a chance to live back in season 3 - "I have a gift for you as well. Your life ... And the lives of your 'Wise Masters', but I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai ... Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
Â 
They took the gift and then went back on her deal. And now Jorah wants her to give them another chance? It just shows me - once again - that the writers don't have a great understanding of the source material. Dany's problem ISN'T that she was too ruthless - the problem is that crucifying 163 Great Masters was ineffective because it didn't change the power structure in Meereen, it just further antagonised the slavers. And now they're presenting Dany's mercy to the Wise Masters of Yunkai as a good idea? No experienced leader would have crucified 163 Great Masters, true, but no leader worth following would give the Wise Masters a second chance of mercy.Â 
Â 
They've just made Dany look totally stupid for some reason. In the books she was naive, inexperienced and idealistic, yes, but never stupid.
Â 
I don't know why I even put this in the "nitpick" thread. It's three seasons' worth of mischaracterisation culminating in terrible decision and after terrible decision on behalf of the writers. In fact, they're making a bigger mess of Meereen than Dany herself did.
Â 
And before anyone jumps in and says something inane like "OMG they totes understand the material", I'm gonna stress that no, they seriously don't. They've probably read ADwD what - once, twice, maybe three times at a push? I've certainly read Dany's chapters more than that, and I've engaged in discussions about her arc in that book for almost 3 years now(!), and still there's no general consensus about what happened in her arc: some think she becomes basically a substitute Harpy; some think she was completely ineffective in dealing with the slavers; some think she was ineffective but also too cruel; some think she should have never turned to Slaver's Bay in the first place; some think she was motivated purely by greed; some think she's heading towards madness; some think she wasn't ruthless enough; some think she just lacked foresight...
Â 
I could continue, but I won't. The bottom line is that D&D are not conveying any of this. The message they're sending us is that Dany is being too harsh on the slavers. And what's their reasoning for this? Jorah's "I would be dead too under your command"? There's simply no logic to that! Jorah sold slaves once; under Dany's rule he may be dead, but most likely (like the majority of the slavers), he would have been given a second chance. If Ned had pardoned Jorah and he had betrayed that by selling slaves again, does anyone honestly think Ned would give him a second chance at mercy?
Â 
And this is further proof that D&D are just not comparable to GRRM, who makes the reader question Dany's actions without trying to sell to us the idea that slavery is a crime that can be forgiven. Tyrion's master, for example, is a fair enough man; he wants to respect the peace with Daenerys and he doesn't particularly mistreat Tyrion, Penny or Jorah; in fact, some of his slaves even like him! But GRRM makes him (and some other slavers) complex and grey without turning Dany into Viserys.
Â 
(And let's be real, a lot of this could be avoided if the writing staff and production team was more diverse. Instead it's a bunch of straight white men who probably all have the same opinions on the story.)


I think one can read the book 3 times and get a pretty good understanding of anything in the books. It's not THAT difficult. You make it sound like someone needs to have read it 6 times for anyone to even begin to contemplate the issues brought about from the books.
1439	solidviper	2014-05-19	I was looking for a more bitter Tyrion, and we saw some of that in the scene with Jaime, which was nice, but I guess I expected more? Maybe it's coming idk.
Â 
I was not spoiled on the moon door scene, and I thought it was fantastic. I actually stood up with my mouth open when he did that.
Â 
I thought the Dany/Daario scene could have been more sexy.
Â 
The Red Woman scene was incredibly boring (as I feel with all her scenes). That's probably my biggest nitpick with this episode because her scenes are always so forgettable for me (minus the leech one)

Yep. He has one of his "seizures" if I remember...which the show appears to have cut from his character entirely. Sansa acted like a bitch to him in the show, if you ask me. Scene was way too rushed.Â

You are mistaking what she did.Â  I edited my post with a summary (sorry) which described a bit better what Dany did.
Â 
She did the same thing that the Dothraki did, she rode up with an army, demanded tribute in exchange for not sacking the city, received said tribute, and she left without sacking the city.Â Â  She never actually conquered Yunkai.Â Â Â  If she wanted slavery abolished, she needed to actually change the government (as in Astapor and Mereen), but she didn't do that with Yunkai.
Â 
If she were to return to Yunkai and then make further demands, she would be seen as belligerant (well, MORE than she is now).Â  That's exactly what she fears in the books.Â  She said so to the Astaporean Ambassador when they wanted her to wage ware on Yunkai with them.Â  That is what Jorah is advocating in this scene.
Â 
The deal she made with Yunkai was completed when they fulfilled their end of the bargain.

I know, I didn't really word that properly...

GRRM writes to ask the reader questions; D&D write to give the viewer answers, but this is a problem because there aren't answers to the problems they're presenting.Â 
Â 
I'm basing their understanding of ADwD purely on what I'm seeing on the screen, and I'm not feeling hopeful at all. They're literally presenting Cersei as more composed than Daenerys - Cersei, the alcoholic narcissist who abused her brother and - at least in the books - had children murdered. But please, tell me that they understand the source material.
Â

Â 
Well, this is just a matter of semantics, really. This is what Dany told Grey Worm: "Tell the slavers I will meet them here, to accept their surrender. Otherwise Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor." She then tells the envoy to "release every slave in Yunkai", or she will show them "no mercy". They comply with her demands, but they immediately re-enslave the freed slaves who did not follow Dany. Clearly her intention was to end slavery in the region, not just free those who were already free. Perhaps the Yunkai'i merely misunderstood her, but I think that's far from the truth; they simply saw she was gone and decided to reject her authority.
Â 
So I just don't understand why Dany should show them mercy. She should either leave them alone (like in the books) and march on Astapor instead (which she couldn't do in the books because of the Sons of the Harpy, who are not yet a problem on the show), or march to Yunkai and sack the city.

That's exactly what I feel the problem was.Â  No time to actually build up the scenes with real dialog and confer an understanding.Â Â  They could have easily kept the "Only Cat" line as well if they just let Lysa rant a bit more about how she 'loved him more than my sister Cat ever did'.Â  Maybe in her rant to Sansa she could talk about how "You look like Cat, but my sister..."Â Â  and so on.
Â 
With less than 10 words of dialog, the Eyrie scenes could have felt a lot more 'smooth' and less rushed.

Â 
The dialogue between Dany and Jorah could have literally been lifted from any number of conversations about her actions in Meereen on this forum, since there is a strong divide between those fans who see the world as black and white [OMG slavery is evil so everyone in a slave society should die!!] and those who see things in shaded of grey and feel her decisions in Meereen are sketchy, so I don't see what there is to complain about. Â 
Â 
She has been portrayed as a messiah UNTIL the last two episodes,LOL.

Â 
Â 
Â 
It's because of the medium.Â  It's harder to have expositionary dialog of a character's inner thoughts, so they have to have them react in dialog with other characters.Â  She had her plan, and Jorah became her surrogate 'inner reason' voice which let her then take the actions she took.Â  She is quite angry in the books as well, but we get to hear this scene play out in her head.Â  When you take it out of her head, you then need to have dialog which makes sense for the other 'sounding board' characters as well.
Â 
The biggest problem is that it's all jammed together right now, so they haven't even revealed the 'Sons of the Harpy' yet, which I believe occured long before the Yunkish/Astapor delegations came to her city.Â  So what you are seeing is a bit of the weirdness of trying to move events earlier and then watching as the plot holes appear.
1451	Lord Damian	2014-05-19	I've forgiven HBO for many things concerning the show, but hell, they didn't show DanyxDaario sex scene.
Â 
HBO literally had one job. They had always to create sex scenes if there wasn't one. But when there could be a sex scene which actually affects the plot, no, they won't do it. It would be too useful! Really, what was the showmakers thinking. They show all that craster-raping but when there could be one consensual sex scene without whores they suddenly don't do it. Apparently they don't have any idea what they're doing.


Emelia Clarke and her agent put their perverbial foot down to HBO and the show producers last year, no more raunchy scenes for Dany. That is probably why the original Daario got pissed off and quit so that they had to get this guy to replace him. HA Ha HA

I miss Petyr building the castle with her.Â Â  That was the scene I think was needed to show how he not only saw her as a pawn, but also as a frightening reminder (to him) of his childhood love.Â  It was probably one of the most important scenes in the books to show the character development of Petyr (who isn't just a static cardboard cutout villain)
Â 
In the books, he must have been having all sorts of conflicting emotions as he remembered playing with Cat and Lysa in the exact same location as a child.

It really is. Compare how well Tyrions interactions with Oberyn and Bronn flow with the clunky dialogue between Brienne and Olenna+ Margaery earlier this season.

Â 
I find they usually do fine when they change around dialogue or invent scenes that deal with character only or make slight variations on the basic premise. Â Where they really falter for me is when they make changes to the plot...they're terrible at this...the plot changes are generally silly and full of huge plot holes and gaps in logic and continuity.
1464	Aethermancer	2014-05-19	I personally hope D&D changed "Only Cat" to "Your Sister" just to take a shot at all the elitists because the pretentiousness here can get quite irritating. It's not something worth getting riled over; it's a very minor deviation from the source material. Hell, most of my non-reader friends found it about as impactful as I found "Only Cat."


Â 
My problem is that when they change things like this, it takes me out of the scene, and my hindbrain jumps up and kicks my suspension of disbelief out of my ear and says "Forget about all that scene that was just built up, now you are thinking about the fact that it was different, and now you are trying to figure out if you preferred the change, or the original, and while you are thinking about that, the episode just ended"
Â 
That's why I hate changes like that.Â  Not because the change was good or not, but because it's hard enough to watch the scene without analyzing it without unnecessary distractions.

D&D change things for the sake of change, so of course they did this to troll book readers. I actually dont mind necessary changes. But change for the sake of change? I cant get behind that.Â 
So? If that's the case, does it really still make it a big deal? If it's an equally impactful line ... what's the issue here? Game of Thrones is an adaptation - not a direct interpretation of ASOIAF. It's a minor deviation that did the job. If you're nitpicking that specific line, it's only because D&D didn't follow the exact manuscript of your beloved books.

1468	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-19	Emelia Clarke and her agent put their perverbial foot down to HBO and the show producers last year, no more raunchy scenes for Dany. That is probably why the original Daario got pissed off and quit so that they had to get this guy to replace him. HA Ha HA

Â 
We could've had a clothed sex scene. There was one of them between Dany and Drogo in season 1 where she "rides" him for the first time.
Â 
This scene was garbage. No chemistry or lust or anything. Dany acting like a stupid bitch queen, no emotion, no tenderness, no lust, no attraction.Â 
Â 
You can shoot sex scenes tastefully with no nudity you know, show her back, show neck kisses, show hands and show the characters kissing. This was utterly pointless and disappointing.

I definitely think the idea is for this season to end on a down for Dany and then they will build her back up by the end of the next season (which should hopefully include Dany learning something important from the dosh khaleenÂ and finish with the battle for MeereenÂ that was supposed to be in ADWD)

Â 
I think they might've trusted the viewers, but it's a sensible change.Â  Having Lysa scream on her way down and the dialogue in general around the scene was a bit weak, however.

Exactly because he is not an idiot he won't come up with a premeditated plan to make Lysa mad and risk everything instead of getting rid of her more subtly.
1478	eumaies	2014-05-19	I admittedly can't remember how exactly it went down in the book, but Sansa seemed unduly bitchy with Sweet Robin. I mean, he accidentally knocks over a little snow tower, apologizes and says they can rebuild it, and she completely flips her shit? Didn't he flail in destroying things left and right before she actually lost her temper?


Yeah that was poorly done. Sansa once again getting portrayed as having no good qualities, basically.Â  I'm not sure why they are trying to make Robin look like a not-so-crazy little boy all of a sudden.Â

1480	eumaies	2014-05-19	Exactly because he is not an idiot he won't come up with a premeditated plan to make Lysa mad and risk everything instead of getting rid of her more subtly.


In the books Petry is not a hopeless romantic for Cat (anymore), nor for Sansa.Â  He might want to screw Sansa for the perverse pleasure but he's not taken with her to the point of clumsiness. He spends plenty of time building a snow castle with her in full view of the courtyard, and then he kisses her.Â  It seems clear to me he was happy to be observed. For instance, he may have wanted to take out Lysa in a way that also makes him seem like a protector figure for Sansa - even as he intentionally set her up to the target of Lysa's ire.Â  THAT's Petry.

Â 
I disagree. I think it's been made clear that Robin isn't right in the head. Any kid that's obsessed with throwing people off a skyscrapper is clearly fucked up. As LF said, his mother should have done that years ago. I don't think the slap made Sansa look bad at all.
1482	binga	2014-05-19	The whole Jorah/Dany/Yunkai business was really stupid. Dany already gave them a chance to live back in season 3 - "I have a gift for you as well. Your life ... And the lives of your 'Wise Masters', but I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai ... Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
Â 
They took the gift and then went back on her deal. And now Jorah wants her to give them another chance? It just shows me - once again - that the writers don't have a great understanding of the source material. Dany's problem ISN'T that she was too ruthless - the problem is that crucifying 163 Great Masters was ineffective because it didn't change the power structure in Meereen, it just further antagonised the slavers. And now they're presenting Dany's mercy to the Wise Masters of Yunkai as a good idea? No experienced leader would have crucified 163 Great Masters, true, but no leader worth following would give the Wise Masters a second chance of mercy.Â 
Â 
They've just made Dany look totally stupid for some reason. In the books she was naive, inexperienced and idealistic, yes, but never stupid.
Â 
I don't know why I even put this in the "nitpick" thread. It's three seasons' worth of mischaracterisation culminating in terrible decision and after terrible decision on behalf of the writers. In fact, they're making a bigger mess of Meereen than Dany herself did.
Â 
And before anyone jumps in and says something inane like "OMG they totes understand the material", I'm gonna stress that no, they seriously don't. They've probably read ADwD what - once, twice, maybe three times at a push? I've certainly read Dany's chapters more than that, and I've engaged in discussions about her arc in that book for almost 3 years now(!), and still there's no general consensus about what happened in her arc: some think she becomes basically a substitute Harpy; some think she was completely ineffective in dealing with the slavers; some think she was ineffective but also too cruel; some think she should have never turned to Slaver's Bay in the first place; some think she was motivated purely by greed; some think she's heading towards madness; some think she wasn't ruthless enough; some think she just lacked foresight...
Â 
I could continue, but I won't. The bottom line is that D&D are not conveying any of this. The message they're sending us is that Dany is being too harsh on the slavers. And what's their reasoning for this? Jorah's "I would be dead too under your command"? There's simply no logic to that! Jorah sold slaves once; under Dany's rule he may be dead, but most likely (like the majority of the slavers), he would have been given a second chance. If Ned had pardoned Jorah and he had betrayed that by selling slaves again, does anyone honestly think Ned would give him a second chance at mercy?
Â 
And this is further proof that D&D are just not comparable to GRRM, who makes the reader question Dany's actions without trying to sell to us the idea that slavery is a crime that can be forgiven. Tyrion's master, for example, is a fair enough man; he wants to respect the peace with Daenerys and he doesn't particularly mistreat Tyrion, Penny or Jorah; in fact, some of his slaves even like him! But GRRM makes him (and some other slavers) complex and grey without turning Dany into Viserys.
Â 
(And let's be real, a lot of this could be avoided if the writing staff and production team was more diverse. Instead it's a bunch of straight white men who probably all have the same opinions on the story.)


Â 
I agree, David and Dan have tried to imprint their ideas on the story a little too much. At first I was going to blame the directors for so many stale moments in season 4 but I think it does probably fall at the feet of the writers. I would prefer moreÂ writers and frankly I would prefer letting HBO take more control over the series and hiring the best people in television to do it. It is hard to make the argument though since David and Dan have done the most difficult job of all which is taking this complex story that could have easily failed and turning it into a huge hit. Those two really understand how to connect with the MTV generation.

1490	Garth Greyfeather	2014-05-19	Arya using a sneak attack for critical damage on Rorge was hands down the stupidest thing i have seen from any episode of any season.

Just..ugh.
1491	Rouse Me Not	2014-05-19	Rant: The Rorge&Biter scene was ridiculous. I mean first off, why would they be creeping around alone at this point rather than attached to a larger group or force? And while I wouldn't call them "smart", they're definitely survivors and have got enough sense not to just attack Arya and Sandor all on their own, out in the open like that
Also, weren't those two a couple of the meanest, toughest sons of bitches around? I mean they were SO dangerous that they were kept locked and chained in a wagon, even amongst the other killers and criminals headed for the wall. They also made pretty short work(along with Arya, Jaqen, and Weasel Soup) of all the guards in the tower at Harrenhal. Rorge then establishes himself as one of the most violent and brutal members of the Brave Companions(a pretty hard bunch to stand out in, I'd imagine), even going as far as threatening Vargo Hoat himself, when angered. He eventually leads the largest of the Mummers' offshoots and completely wipes out the town of Saltpans, butchering every man, woman and child in sight, and leaving the whole place a smoking ruin. Afterwards, he and Biter both survive several attacks by the Brotherhood in retaliation. And when Brienne faces the two of them, she is brought down and barely escapes with her life, only surviving thanks to a spear through the back of Biter's neck, courtesy of Gendry.
Not saying that Sandor, one of the deadliest warriors in the Seven Kingdoms, and sneaky killer Arya, couldn't take em, but it would be a tough fight, leaving no one unscathed by the end. But in this episode, Sandor and Arya dispatch them effortlessly, like they're no more than common scum. I don't see why they were written off like this when they should both still have major parts to play. I mean, why even bother including them in the first place?

Â 
Tyrions reaction to Oberyn saying he would be his champion didn't feel like PD's best work as an actor.
Â 
I felt exactly zero passion from Dany in her dealing with Darrio. It felt like a weird power thing. Which is fine, I suppose, just very different.Â
1494	Gogossos	2014-05-19	I used to defend the opening credits but now I don't get it. Winterfell, the Wall, KL and wherever Dany is at always get screen time, I understand that, but the rest should really shift depending the episode. We didn't need Braavos or the Dreadfort in this episode, so I don't get why they couldn't adjust it. Lack of money or being too busy could be explanations though.
Â 
Â 


The whole Jorah/Dany/Yunkai business was really stupid.Â 


Â 
Amen, to your whole rant and subsequent ones. The Yunkai thing fails me. I get (as somebody just argued upthread) that they need to externalize Dany's internal conflict but the way they are going about it is this: make Dany stupid/too cruel or what ever, then make somebody else make a reasoned argument against, then Dany changes her mind. Whilst it achieves its goal, it undermines Dany's character. Did she really order the execution of all the Yunkai'i masters? And exactly how is the Second Sons going to do it, since obviously the city's defences are back up? Why not leave Yunkai alone like she did in the books?
Â 
And the Daario thing, why not follow the books logic, there was nothing wrong with it. She sends him away partly because she's attracted to him but knows she shouldn't really indulge (at that point in time anyway). And later when Daario basically advises a RW execution, she shudders at how monstrous he is. All that characterisation goes out of the window with the way they've tackled it. Why not just send Daario's Second Sons to protect the Llazarene people or something?
Â 


Dany being a little to mad so soon. Ordering the massacre of every slavemaster in Yunkai is a BIG step in the wrong direction. She's supposed to be conflicted.Â 


Â 
As hinted above, I totally agree that this is a huge step casually dropped in here, in an attempt to make Dany complex. Being complex does not mean taking a huge step in one direction before being persuaded to take, basically, the opposite route. Dany has plenty of complicated decision making, the best way would be to allow her council to debate the options before she makes up her mind.
Â 
Plus where are the Dothraki this season?
Â 


Yeah that's over the top.Â  The change to "your sister" was so that new viewer don't get lost and ask "who's Cat?"
Â 
I think they might've trusted the viewers, but it's a sensible change.Â  Having Lysa scream on her way down and the dialogue in general around the scene was a bit weak, however.


Â 
I thought Sansa not screaming was the strange thing. As readers, seeing through Sansa's eyes, Â I suppose we'd all scream in shock, and on tv the contrast between a screaming shocked Sansa and a calm Littlefinger would be great, followed by Sansa's (I presume) brilliant theme closing the episode.

Well, they needed another way for Sandor to get an infected wound so they could wisely depict his and Arya's parting the same as in the book and they thought "Hey!Â  How about an infected human bite?!" and then they thought "Hey!Â  How about that guy 'Biter'?!!"Â  I mean, they we're obviously not going to have Brienne's confrontation with them in the show so they thought they'd tie up those two loose ends here.Â  To me, I guess it's alright becauseÂ it gets Sandor blood poisoning and eliminates another two minor characters but, yeah, it might mean not-so-good things for Brienne's storyline down the road.
Â 
Also, I actually thought Tyrion's reaction to Oberyn agreeing to champion him worked.Â  I mean, what else would Tyrion be feeling at that moment but incredible relief?Â  The Red Viper has a reputation as one of the foremost warriors in the realm and is even better than Bronn.Â  So Tyrion would just beÂ incredibly happy about this great stroke of luck Â Â

Closing out their arcs.Â  Otherwise, you'd have fans speculating that Biter is going to sit the Iron Throne.Â  Also, Arya's not ready to kill a stranger for no reason, and they are playing up "the list" for purposes of referring to it with DyingHound.

But they didn't really have a pitched battle.Â  Biter's surprise attack was instantly and conclusively countered, and Arya got the drop on Rorge.Â  He didn't expect a young teen girl was about to stab him or he'd have had his guard up.Â
1502	RhaenysBalerion	2014-05-19	- Jaime/Tyrion scene was completely pointless. Yes, we the drill already. Poor privileged rich boys of wealthy and powerful dad, what a terrible fate that they must suffer under daddy's control. We are all supposed to feel very sorry for poor Jaime and Tyrion. We get it.Â 
Â 
- Rorge and Biter. Again, tell me what was the point? A much shorter scene could have let the Hound and Arya know of Joff's death. Killing Rorge? He wasn't even on Arya's list. And the talking with that dying fella, what_was_the_point?
Â 
- Hound and Arya 2.0. Yes. We also know that we are supposed to feel very sorry for the Hound too. We already knew he was afraid of fire (Blackwater), we already knew Gregor burned him (Tourney of the Hand). I'm aware that they were trying to raise awareness of why we should revive our hate for Gregor, but gutting those prisoners or whatever they were was persuasive enough. Besides, Oberyn is going to fight Gregor and not the Hound and people still have little clue of who Elia is and what happened to her, so how about something more about Elia or showing Gregor practicing cruelty on women to get at least a teeny little bit closer to the Elia story. Even though Oberyn is making huge efforts of talking about his sister's murder in every single episode he shows up in, that's still little enough, because it's just words (and words are wind) and the audience forgets. Show me Gregor slapping up some poor whore in a burned inn (poor smallfalk sidestory -check, violent Mountain - check) and THEN I will have something to connect Oberyn's Elia lines to.Â 
Â 
- Daenerys finds Daario in her private chambers. That woman drinking wine and telling the guy to take off his clothes is CERSEI. Not Daenerys. Daenerys stressed over her attraction to Daario for numerous chapters because she still loved Drogo too and she felt guilty, but at the same time, she was a horny young woman around a hot douche. What happened to that part? And she liked Daario, she was attracted to him and she didn't treat him as a fuck toy. That scene was a complete Cersei moment and Daenerys isn't a bitch like Cersei. And what of Moonboy and Osmund Kettleblack or Meryn Trant or hell cares who they make it in the show?
Â 
- Selyse and Mel. I'm not a Stannis fan, but who the FUCK cares about Selyse? And what the fuck was the point of that scene apart from boob time? And that hint about Shireen's fate. Great, but why did we need such a long and boring and pointless scene to hint Shireen's fate and more importantly, if we indulge in such a long and boring and pointless scene to hint Shireen's fate why exclude bloody STANNIS of it? I bet people don't even recall who the fuck is Stannis anymore.Â 
Â 
- More crying Peter Dinklage... as I've said before. We get it. Poor poor Tyrion.Â 
Â 
- The moondoor scene was a bit shaky. The part when Lysa made Sansa look down and held her there screaming. I didn't believe it. It seemed too acted out both from Sophie's and Kate Dickie's part. Then the Littlefinger part was pretty cool.Â 
Â 
- Erm... Ellaria Sand was eaten by a gigantic gummy lion? They could have shown her on the trial at least...Â
1503	Charlie Of House Bucket	2014-05-19	I liked this episode a lot.Â  It was very 'characters connecting' themed, with a fairly low hack & slash/action quota.Â  Rory McCann did a super job showing the more depressing side of the Hound's character.
Â 
My nitpicks are thus fairly small:
Â 
1. I wish they would have moved mountains to get the original Mountain actor back.Â  He was by far the best and scariest.Â  The second one looked like some dorky basketball player in armor and I'm both glad to see him gone and glad he had almost nothing to do while he was on screen, but I'm having problems accepting this big ginger too.Â  I know the character, I understand it's supposed to be the same person, it shouldn't matter if I'm able to look past it and I kind of can, but crikey, three is just too many Mountains.Â  Continuity strained++.
Â 
2. Like many here, I felt the Daario/Dany scene pretty forced.
Â 
3. I didn't like Brienne telling Hotpie to give her the "short version" about Arya.Â  Yes, okay, they've established that he's a rambler, but it would be the one circumstance where she'd want as much detail as possible, I should think.Â
1504	Raksha 2014	2014-05-19	The Eyrie scenes felt rushed. Sansa building the snow castle wasn't sad or emotional enough, I loved this scene in the book, it was so full of sadness, and they did not convey this on the show.


Â 
They could have cut down the Melisandre/Selyse scene by a minute or two, skipped Hot Pie's presentation of yet another Stark wolf pastry, and done a much better job on the snow castle scene. Â Hot Pie and Selyse and even Melisandre are not supposed to be as important a character as Sansa, and this was a crucial scene in her development (not to mention one of the best scene's GRRM wrote). Â It's definitely too rushed; LF in the book spent time carefully helping Sansa build the snow castle (showing his patience and skill, he was trying to get Sansa's trust by helping her in a neutral, meticulous but gentle way); in the TV-version, he waltzes in and the snow Winterfell, all of Sansa's emotion over her lost home is swept away to talk about 'enemies' and the sudden kiss (which was not clear, as it was in the books, that Sansa was not enjoying it or wanting it). Â 
Â 
They're going to have to completely change the SweetRobin/Sansa dynamic, in fact they already have. Â Sansa mothering the orphaned boy will not work so well here, because the boy looks about 12, is played by a 13-year-old, it's going to be either brother/sisterly or boyish crush on older girl or a mix of both. Â Robin was semi-romantic here in a spoiled brattish way, boasting how when they're married, he will make anyone Sansa doesn't like "fly". Â (wonder if he'll eventually do that to Littlefinger on Sansa's command!). Â 
Â 
And where are the servants? Â The Eyrie is apparently a ghost town? Â Lysa doesn't bring a trusted stooge along to help shove her niece (who's twice her size) out the Moon Door, or at least bar the door? Â 
Â 
But I loved Tyrion's scenes, and especially the Oberyn/Tyrion scene.
1505	solidviper	2014-05-19	- Jaime/Tyrion scene was completely pointless. Yes, we the drill already. Poor privileged rich boys of wealthy and powerful dad, what a terrible fate that they must suffer under daddy's control. We are all supposed to feel very sorry for poor Jaime and Tyrion. We get it.Â 
Â 
- Rorge and Biter. Again, tell me what was the point? A much shorter scene could have let the Hound and Arya know of Joff's death. Killing Rorge? He wasn't even on Arya's list. And the talking with that dying fella, what_was_the_point?
Â 
- Hound and Arya 2.0. Yes. We also know that we are supposed to feel very sorry for the Hound too. We already knew he was afraid of fire (Blackwater), we already knew Gregor burned him (Tourney of the Hand). I'm aware that they were trying to raise awareness of why we should revive our hate for Gregor, but gutting those prisoners or whatever they were was persuasive enough. Besides, Oberyn is going to fight Gregor and not the Hound and people still have little clue of who Elia is and what happened to her, so how about something more about Elia or showing Gregor practicing cruelty on women to get at least a teeny little bit closer to the Elia story.

Â 
So the entire episode then?
1506	Raksha 2014	2014-05-19	No, Littlefinger is capable of being quite impulsive around Sansa.Â  The kiss is part of that.Â  Here's George R. R. Martin himself on the matter.


Â 
Â 
Even in the books, I thought LF's kissing Sansa in the snowy courtyard was completely impulsive. Â Careful, manipulative Littlefinger, whose long-term strategy needs to keep Sansa protected and concealed for the next year or two at least, kisses her outside, in full view of any servant or Lady-of-the-Eyrie who just happens to be at a window, plants a full-mouth kiss on his supposed daughter or (in the TV show) niece? Â That kiss nearly undid LF's plans; forcing him to kill Lysa probably at least several months ahead of schedule (LF would have probably wanted more time to ingratiate himself with the Vale-lords, preferably with a smiling Lady Lysa by his side). Â And it nearly destroyed Sansa, his prize pawn.
1507	RhaenysBalerion	2014-05-19	Â 
So the entire episode then? 


Â 
Hehe, no, I did post in the positive nitpicking thread too and there are other small moments I liked too.
1508	Aethermancer	2014-05-19	Show me the quote on that.Â  Petry in the books is not an idiot.


Â 
I don't have the books handy, but I seem to remember a bit of text which basically amounted to a moment where you could see Petyr quickly running through his options and deciding that "Yeah Lysa is much further off the rails than I originally thought and is going to spoil my plans, I can just accelerate the timing of my planned assassination of Lysa without too much fuss since the only witness here is the bard noone likes. *Cue 'Only Cat'* "
Â 
Impulsive, but not uncalculated.
1509	OnlyOne	2014-05-19	- That Arya monologue about nothing.... my goodness was that cringeworthy. It tried way too hard to be pseudo-philosophical and deep, and just fell flat and failed.Â 
- Brienne seems too loud and snarky. I prefer the quiet and shy book!Brienne.Â 
- Tyrion isn't bitter enough yet. He still felt the need to be cracking little jokes with Jaime in his usual tone. Something needs to change, cause after episode 8 he's sitting out episode 9, and when we see him again in 10 he is gonna need to beÂ veryÂ different.
- The scene between Melisandre and Selyse was kind of pointless, apart from Carice's beautiful naked body. I would have much preferred a Stannis scene.Â 
- Jon's scene was pointless, apart from introducing Yarwyck. We get it, Alliser Thorne's an asshole.
Â 
But the worst offender of all....
Â 
Dany didn't go naked, and we didn't see the sex scene. Seriously HBO? You throw in so many pointless and gratuitous sex scenes that when one comes up that's actually relevant to the story and characters, you just essentially do a fade to black? Maybe it sounds a little pervy, but I was actually looking forward to seeing that scene. It's not as if the ladies would be annoyed either. We saw Daario take his stuff off. This episode was a very short 51 minutes, why not just include their sex scene to add another couple of minutes? Unlike the others it's actually relevant to the story and characters.Â 
Â 
Ok, I realize that last nitpick is a bit dumb, but oh well. A man can have his hopes.

Boobs aren't enough for you, eh? Pfft.

1511	gash	2014-05-19	Â 
Spoken like a girl who has never experienced true depression. I can tell you "nothing" fucking sucks.Â 


Â 
eh? a girl who was at her father's beheading and found out her brother and mother were murdered also?
Â 
thought it was a great line tbh. arya basically with zero cares about death anymore and a mature understanding of death itself - death is not something to fear, because you can't feel anything, it's literally nothing.

1512	Petyr Patter	2014-05-19	Being impulsive is definitely part of Littlefinger's character.Â  However, he mostly makes it work for him by seizing opportunities when they occur.Â  I don't think he planned on Lysa being alone next to the Moondoor with only Sansa and her attempted rapist as witnesses, but when he realizes the opportunity he capitilizes on it.Â  Ditto when Catelyn shows Robert's knife to him, he sees an opportunity to further inflame Lannistar and Stark relations and keep them from seeing the true killer, himself and Lysa.
Â 
In contrast, I get the feeling Varys never does anything on impulsive but tries to make very longterm plans and sticks with them.
1513	The Boar of Gore	2014-05-19	Real nitpick: no boiling wine to sterilize wounds? Why not? No comprehende. What was Arya supposed to do with that flaming brand? Cauterize the wound? She would only have made it worse! *Sigh* After showing Khal Drogo die from septicemia, the show ought to know better than to show us a man with a large human bite mark that isn't going to go septic and kill him!!
Â 
This next isn't really a nitpick, more of a lament. The final scene was good, but the scene in the book was so much more powerful I'm at a loss to understand why they changed it! I can see why they cut short the snowcastle scene, but they made Sansa and LF's kiss go on too long, as if it wasn't completely non-consensual. Those are nitpicks though. I just don't see why they changed anything at all about the scene with Lysa, Sansa, LF and the Moon Door...
1514	The Boar of Gore	2014-05-19	I've forgiven HBO for many things concerning the show, but hell, they didn't show DanyxDaario sex scene.
Â 
HBO literally had one job. They had always to create sex scenes if there wasn't one. But when there could be a sex scene which actually affects the plot, no, they won't do it. It would be too useful! Really, what was the showmakers thinking. They show all that craster-raping but when there could be one consensual sex scene without whores they suddenly don't do it. Apparently they don't have any idea what they're doing.


Â 
I guess sex scenes that actually mean something to the audience, with characters we actually empathize with...well that would be obscene!!
1515	solidviper	2014-05-19	Â 
Hehe, no, I did post in the positive nitpicking thread too and there are other small moments I liked too. 


Â 
haha I saw  I definitely agree with a lot of your nitpicks actually
1516	The Boar of Gore	2014-05-19	I would have liked a single line similar to "...That's the heart... The gift of mercy to any man..." It would have added gravitas to The Hound's final scene...


Â 
I kept expecting him to ask for 'the gift of mercy'. But at least he did tell Arya that was where you stab someone in the heart.
1517	Veltigar	2014-05-19	Â  Hot Pie and Selyse and even Melisandre are not supposed to be as important a character as Sansa, and this was a crucial scene in her development (not to mention one of the best scene's GRRM wrote). Â It's definitely too rushed; LF in the book spent time carefully helping Sansa build the snow castle (showing his patience and skill, he was trying to get Sansa's trust by helping her in a neutral, meticulous but gentle way); in the TV-version, he waltzes in and the snow Winterfell, all of Sansa's emotion over her lost home is swept away to talk about 'enemies' and the sudden kiss (which was not clear, as it was in the books, that Sansa was not enjoying it or wanting it). Â 
Â 


The fuck do you mean Hot Pie not important? He's like the main character in the books  He's the Pie that was Promised Â
1518	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-05-19	Â 
The line just felt out of the blue, and not in a surprising way, just in a 'Wait, what?Â  Umm, did I just mishear you because I'm not really feeling it now... I mean, I brought you flowers and I'm trying to be romantic here.Â  I kind of expected a little bit of foreplay would be preferred and here you are just stating in a monotone voice 'take off your clothes'...Â  I knew you would make me work for it, but I didn't expect it would be in the form of working myself up for it.'

Exactly.
1519	Red Tiger	2014-05-19	This so much. WTF was this?
Â 
And what was with Biter appearing out of nowhere and jumping on the Hound's back? Such a stupid scene. How the hell were these two able to sneak up on Arya and the Hound?
Â 
Everything in Meereen was just stupid.Â  It really seems that the writers have no clue what to do with this plotline.
Â 
How old is Robin supposed to be? 12? He seems way too old for the way he is behaving, above and beyond what just being really spoiled can explain.


That's actually part of his storyline. In the books Catelyn points out that Bran was twice as fierce as Robin when he was half his age.
1520	protar	2014-05-19	Nitpicks:
No only Cat. I mean seriously, how does anyone who loves this series take that scene and go "let's take out one of the series' most iconic lines." I mean what were they scared people wouldn't know who Cat was?
Jon wanting to seal the Wall.
Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is a cheesy line attempting to be deep and philosophical.
No Dany/Daario sex. God forbid we have a plot relevant sex scene!
Gregor killing random people makes no sense.
1521	Nami	2014-05-19	I'm usually really hard on the episodes & in general really enjoyed this one. I'm also usually a HUGE Dany fan though & that is what I hated about this episode.
"Take off your clothes" how RI-DIC-U-LOUS!
Emilia Clarke is gorgeous but she has got to get more emotions than the "I am the blood of the dragon do as I command spoiled brat used to getting what I want" tone.


Â 

God I facepalmed so hard at this scene that I left a hand print on my forehead
It was so bad in a whole new level
1522	Kaspiro	2014-05-19	It seemed like the entire Hound scene was leading up to an introduction of the 'gift of mercy', but it was never mentioned or even alluded to by another name. The Hound just killed the man and immediately forgot about it. Why miss the opportunity to have viewer's remember that scene when Arya gives Sandor the 'gift of mercy' (as it's begun to seem like she definitely will)? Also, why has almost every Hound-Arya scene since the season premiere been filler? They killed Polliver, Sandor had a code, Sandor broke the code by stealing from a farmer and undid the characterization of the previous episodes, they kept traveling, they killed Rorge and Biter and learned nothing, and they went onwards. They've missed so many opportunities for real characterization.Â 
Â 
With this, the scene at Craster's keep and the ridiculously badly handled Asha/Yara scene, this is beginning to seem like a season defined by filler.Â

1523	Queen of Whores	2014-05-19	With this, the scene at Craster's keep and the ridiculously badly handled Asha/Yara scene, this is beginning to seem like a season defined by filler.Â 

An unfortunate consequence of stretching 300 pages over 10 hours.
1524	Hound's She-wolf	2014-05-19	So many nitpicks, so little time....
Â 
Where was 'Only Cat?' And where was 'the gift of mercy?' Two short little phrases that could have easily been included.
Â 
Biter has some mad hops, to be able to jump on a six and a half foot man's back, find enough skin under his armor and bite hard enough to break the skin,
Where the hell did they come from? How did they find out about the reward for the Hound so damn fast? And who is going to bite Brienne now? And boy did they both die really easily and quickly. These guys were the creme puffs of the bad guy world.
Â 
And then to have to battle hardened warrior not properly take care of an injury? *rolling my eyes*
Â 
I was so looking forward to the Snow Castle scene, it starts out beautifully and then a really healthy not seizure having Robyn shows up and it turns into a fight between two six year olds.
Â 
And the worst tragedy of all, not enough naked Daario.
1525	Ho Ho Hodor	2014-05-19	I have been sooo disappointed by this season its silly... I wont get to the overall reasons y but I will address this episode
Â 
"Only Cat" is one of the best/iconic lines in the entire series for me (it would be like leaving out "Ed fetch me a block"!!)Â Â and that includes the speech by LF before it (he is LF in this instance not Petyr) but Lysa is falling apart at the seems and he seems to be building her up only to pull the rug from under her with 2 words! it was greatness... I did like the fact that she slapped the hell out of Sweet Robin instead of killing giant (but theÂ giant had to do with the prophecy)Â  and I felt Petyr helping Sansa build the castle was another great part of the chapter because it showed her intelligence and Petyrs in comparison and it built up to the kiss.. the scene with Lysa and Sansa isn't bat shit crazy enough for me and leaving out LFs speech was aggravating BUT changing it to "your sister" pushed me out the Moon Door so to speak... if people don't remember who Cat is then say Catlyn and have that worked into the speech leading up to the push... argh just drove me nuts
Â 
Rorge and Biter were pointless to throw in there since it could have been a better scene with like 5 peasants trying to take the Hound in while saving Rorge and Biter for Brienne (who ill get to in a minute)Â however I don't think she interacted with them in the show but having her kill them would have been a cool nod to the book readers... and Arya is one of my top favorite characters but all of the crazy psychopath brooding kind of takes away from the development with the HoBaW later... it just give the Hound the neck wound that "kills" him so Arya can leave...
Â 
I don't like the way Brienne came and said Sansa Stark (go Pod for saying it) and the fact that it helps her by knowing Arya is alive this early.. on top of that I feel in the books shes kind of dumb and the show makes her much smarter... one of my favorite things was Pod saying SerÂ  uh M'lady so the lack of that its nitpicky... so what is she going to do in the mean time without her 2 fight scenes before LS?? is she going to meet Randyl Tarly? well just have to see.. I didn't mind the addition of Hot Pie but it was just kind of out of nowhere and meh
Â 
The Mountain looks way to young and nice compared to the book version.. I agree with the first Mountain being the best one yet... he has the right balance of fury, 0 fucks given and strength.. weve already talked about how poorly that scene was done with no indication of who the people he is unnecessarily slaughtering to make him the bad guy.. kind of like the Thenns eating the crow arm and making them cannibals so we know theyre the bads
Â 
I skip Mereen in my rereads so its no surprise its not good... like stated a million times above Dany-Daario have no chemistry and it just seems so forced.. not a big fan of the acting alone on either as well
1526	Rouse Me Not	2014-05-19	That's actually part of his storyline. In the books Catelyn points out that Bran was twice as fierce as Robin when he was half his age.


I think she mentioned Rickon as being twice as fierce at half his age, as Bran is actually older.
1527	Kaspiro	2014-05-19	An unfortunate consequence of stretching 300 pages over 10 hours.


Â 
I'll admit that's definitely an understandable reason to have a lot of filler in this season. But if they knew they'd have so much free time, why not spend some of it on plot-advancing scenes or add plot-advancing elements to scenes that are mostly filler? Asha/Yara's scene might have been used to set up the Greyjoys, and shown again in a Season 5 recap (like Oberyn's mention of his daughters). They've spent a lot of time with Jon discussing the threat of the wildlings, whose motives have not been described in detail yet. The Thenns were introduced and haven't been brought up again for six episodes. Why not have scenes showing the wildlings? There's really no good reason so many of these scenes have to be pure filler, rather than filler with some plot relevance (which most of the Hound and Arya's scenes, Asha/Yara and Craster's Keep have lacked).
1528	Le Cygne	2014-05-19	Enough with the Emilia no nudity rumors, link or it didn't happen. These keep going around for various actors, and then they do nude scenes.

There, I said it
1530	Lord Stokeworth	2014-05-19	I liked the Eyrie scene a lot. BUT, I couldn't help to notice that while there's a mild snow there, a few episodes back we were shown a snow-less North. Is that supposed to make sense?
1531	Le Cygne	2014-05-19	Didn't like a lot of it, just calling out a few things...The Hound should have told his story to Sansa, and this would have been a nice time to bring her up, since they were all talking about sisters and brothers, and all. Other than that, Rory and Maisie rocked it.Sansa story is a mess, as usual (though interesting parallel scenes, Sansa slapping Sweetrobin, Sandor slapping Arya, maybe next time they can just scold them, a bit more in character that way).Daario, my only regret is we didn't see everything, but Dany sitting back taking it all in, priceless.Needless line changes. I would pay them to have Jon say, Ghost, to me.Pod line is actually My Lady not Milady. He knows how to say it properly.

1532	Godsbraid	2014-05-19	What is going on with the (nonexisting) dornish ladies?! First there was NO women among the visiting dornish lords in episode 1, and now Oberyn say that his FATHER brought him and Elia to Casterly Rock. Throwing in some referances to dornish inheritance-laws, Myrcella, etc would have bern nice. 
Apart from Ellarias mention of bastards in Dorne and Oberyns mention of his daughters, we have heard almost nothing of dornish culture. All we have been given is the brothel scenes, some of seemed a bit unnecessery. 
I hope they handle the dornish better next season when I guess the Queenmaker-plot might take at least some screen-time.
1533	Le Cygne	2014-05-19	And she liked Daario, she was attracted to him and she didn't treat him as a fuck toy.Exactly. They liked each other, they both used the word love, and Emilia did, too. It would have been nice to show the after scene, a kiss. I liked that we finally got a scene with the woman clothed and the man naked, went a fraction of the way to restore the balance of all those other scenes where it was the opposite, including the one last season with Dany and Daario. And also showed Dany making a choice, and there was a similar line in the books, take off your clothes.(link on the other thread)

1534	Tim Thomason	2014-05-19	The mountain scene really bugged me.
Â 
Â 
Yea, Ramsay also kindaÂ  does his sick shit out of sight as well, like hunting girls in the woods, this seemed to be taking place in the streets of kingslanding, probably somewhere near the famous petyr brothal? christ.
And who were they anyway, peasants, criminals? it wasn't explained at all, it was just him killing random people to show off how brutal he is.
If they are peasants and petty criminals wouldn't they be more likely to be sent to the wall, instead of being given to the mountain as target practice.
So much about the scene bothers me.


Â 
They weren't unarmed. They were unchained and then handed swords and other weapons before facing the Mountain. The one guy tried to drop his sword and plead for mercy, culminating in an offscreen bludgeoning by Gregor's sword (bad idea, one guy).

The way I see it, an earlier scene would go like this:
Â 

CERSEI: "Father, Gregor Clegane will soon arrive for the trial. He's asked for some volunteers to spar with, in preparation for the trial. I suggested he look towards Flea Bottom."
TYWIN: "No, that won't do. We can't afford another panic-stricken riot. Free up the dungeons of some of the recent thieves. Let the Mountain 'practice' his skills on them instead. In the courtyard outside of the keep, away from prying eyes."

Â 
Â 
Alternatively, it's possible that Gregor brought these men with him (all "supporters of Robb Stark's claim," e.g. random peasants he picked up on the way there), and they were his POWs, with permission from the crown to do as he saw fit about their justice. Disregarding my quote above, the scene might've occurred just outside of King's Landing, and away from Tywin's (direct) purview.
Â 
The Eyrie being snowed up makes sense, because the Eyrie is high in the Mountains (think Denver), whereas the North is on much flatter land.
1535	ipsuel	2014-05-19	An unfortunate consequence of stretching 300 pages over 10 hours.


Â If it were any other author (or series of books) I could agree with this -- but there is *so much* to draw from here -- the show runners have tons and tons and tons of things they could be doing (from the books) that advances both plot/character development.Â
1536	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-05-19	I loved this episode, I really did. But can someone please explain to me why they'll have any random naked prostitue in the background for no reason, but won't show Dany getting it on with Daario? Goddamnit! 
Also, does this mean there won't be a lesbian scene between Dany and Missandei? 
Melisandre/Selyse scene was a bit odd.
"Nothing is...nothing." Um. OK. I bet the dying man really appreciated that pearl of wisdom from an 11 year old.
Oh yeah. The Mountain scene was bizarre. "Uh, how do we show that this guys a violent monster?" 'No idea. Have him kill peasants or something."

Â 
What they should've done with the Mountain was have him cross paths with Arya's and Brienne's story.
Â 
First have him raid a village where Arya and the Hound are. We could see glimpses of his brutality, backstory of Sandor's hatred for him and also some tension whilst they have to hide from him and his men to prevent being taken back to Kings Landing.
Â 
Then have the Mountain encounter Brienne and Pod whilst he's on his way to the capital. Have a confrontation between them that is barely avoided. This would add tension to Brienne's story and further build Gregor up as a legend to be feared.
1538	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-19	The Mountain has such a baby face and is not nearly as scary as in series 1.


Â 
LOL, one of my original nits watching last night that I didn't get a chance to post......first off, dude looked like he could have been Mark Addy/King Robert's brother, second......he looks like he should be The Hound's younger brother. Â Although, I give up on this role for the show, it's a shame, I thought S1 Mountain was perfect, he had the size, but more importantly, he had the rage and anger act just boiling out of him. Â He'd have been great in the coming fight. Â Still, since The Fight is why they hired Number 3, I'm sure he'll be good, or....I'm trying to be. Â

1540	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-19	Mountain 1 was best.
What did you think of Daario?


Â 
He looks damn good, but personality wise, he doesn't feel like Daario. Â I'm not sure who he's playing, to be honest.......but once the clothes came off, I was a bit more interested, LOL Â I don't think it's the actor's fault, I'm just not sure what the writers are doing. Â I've heard good things about the actor, but the character he's being given to play just doesn't feel like Daario, to me anyway. Â He needs that splash, that swagger that Daario 1.0 had going for him. Â I have the feeling that Daario the Second could do that, make a personality splash, D&D just don't seem to be writing it for him. Â Granted, the one Daario thing he does have, sorta, is the beard, but I'm all for shaving it off. Â Once the clothes came off, I was wishing I could hop on screen, razor in hand. Â
1541	Hound's She-wolf	2014-05-19	I want frontal nudity
There, I said it


Be careful what you wish for...remember we got full frontal Hodor in the first season. Please be more specific when tossing that out, we could always get a Walder Frey or Varys if D&D decided to be dicks.

1543	Zoip	2014-05-19	I'm probably alone in this, but Book-Brienne was one of my favourite POV's and I very much dislike how they basically reduced her to be the comic relief of the series, which she doesn't deserve IMO.
Â 
The Mountain scene was ridiculous. That made no sense at all.Â 
Â 
The rest of this episode wasn't fantastic either. There is so much great material in the books that I really don't understand some of the choices the writers are making in this fourth season. I'm really worried that they are painting themselves into a corner with some of the shenanigans they're pulling. Brienne is an example of a very interesting character (the one pure, straightforward, albeit naive character in a world built on double agendas and lies) thats just been flattened like a pancake. Sansa's storyline has also been robbed of it's shine, with Petyr just coming off as a child molester with his creepy voice.Â 
Â 
Â 


Lysa flailing her arms while falling looked like some ACME sh-t. I swear, I expected a dusty poof when she hit the bottom.


Â 
Me too! I was actually surprised when that didn't happen. Then I remembered I wasn't watching an episode of Looney Tunes.Â
1544	Bowen	2014-05-19	Is it me or does Thorne seem way too petty?
Oberyn scene was quality but the rest just didn't do it for me.
1545	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-19	Nitpicks:
Â 
1) Biter trying to bite Sandor (and really the whole 'nothing' speech. I see what they are trying to do, but it ain't working)
Â 
2) "Your sister" was bad enough, but the CGI was shitty
Â 
3) Emilia Clarke not wearing that second dress in all of her scenes
Â 
4) Not enough Hot Pie
Â 
5) Melissandre was just weird. Normally I don't complain about the nudity, but it just seemed strange here.
Â 
6) No Eyrie in the opening credits? But the dreadfort and Braavos were there? The credits really start to annoy me. I get that they keep showing WF, but they should change the others if they don't appear in the episode.
Â 
Â 
Do we even know if they had sex? I get that it was implied, but she could have had Daario strud around in the nude there.


Â 
I always enjoy when you show up, and not just cause of your avi. Â 
Â 
1. Â Biter.......there to bite, huh? Â ITA The nothing was..........nothing worth while. Â 
Â 
2. Â CGI was shitty, it must have been, I don't usually notice such things, LOL, not that much, anyway.
Â 
3. Â I'll see ya the Emilia Clark gown for a new outfit for Oberyn. Â 
Â 
4. Â Never enough Hot Pie, and it is best with extra gravy and bread.
Â 
5. Â Depending on the scene, I'm back and forth on the nudity issue. Â It's the rape overload that was getting to me previously. Â You know it's too much rape when half the participants look as bored as they did at Craster's Keep. Â With Mel, I've come to the conclusion that part of her character is comfortableness with herself, nudity abounds. Â What will be funny is.........with that notion of her comfort in her own skin, I'll LMAO if it's just a glamoured boob job. Â   Â Yeah, yeah, I know, no ruby last night in the tub, maybe that's what the blue juju juice was for? Â 
Â 
6. Â This number is the main reason I wanted to answer, the opening credits. Â A, they are getting lazy, and B, the new angle flyover opening that they've tried to be too cute with.........is half the reason I think they don't pay the same attention to changing up locales each episode. Â I just wonder if that plays into it, the new angle, which annoys the hell out of me.
Â 
Well, I wanted to answer the post for Hot Pie, for Number 6, and to say HI to you and The Ned. Â ~Waves Hi~

Oh, I like the guy, I'm going with it, I'm just not sure who he's playing, LOL Â I put that down to D&D's tampering. Â I'm all for recasting when it's needed, I just think they wrote him so different because they are getting touchy about it, maybe? Â I'm not sure why, but I'm still upset they didn't recast The Great Jon, sooooooooooo, that and beard bargaining aside, I'm all for it. Â From what I hear of Michael's acting skills, I bet he could do the swag......I'm not sure why they aren't writing it for him.
Â 
ETA: Â Yes, the full frontal with some swag. Â Â

1548	MyLittleFinger	2014-05-19	Sophie Turner isn't a good actress, but she certainly has the most ravenous fans who will blame her wooden delivery and blank stare on everybody else.Â 
Â 
There I said it.
1549	Aldi_AA	2014-05-19	Rant: The Rorge&Biter scene was ridiculous. I mean first off, why would they be creeping around alone at this point rather than attached to a larger group or force? And while I wouldn't call them "smart", they're definitely survivors and have got enough sense not to just attack Arya and Sandor all on their own, out in the open like that
Also, weren't those two a couple of the meanest, toughest sons of bitches around? I mean they were SO dangerous that they were kept locked and chained in a wagon, even amongst the other killers and criminals headed for the wall. They also made pretty short work(along with Arya, Jaqen, and Weasel Soup) of all the guards in the tower at Harrenhal. Rorge then establishes himself as one of the most violent and brutal members of the Brave Companions(a pretty hard bunch to stand out in, I'd imagine), even going as far as threatening Vargo Hoat himself, when angered. He eventually leads the largest of the Mummers' offshoots and completely wipes out the town of Saltpans, butchering every man, woman and child in sight, and leaving the whole place a smoking ruin. Afterwards, he and Biter both survive several attacks by the Brotherhood in retaliation. And when Brienne faces the two of them, she is brought down and barely escapes with her life, only surviving thanks to a spear through the back of Biter's neck, courtesy of Gendry.
Not saying that Sandor, one of the deadliest warriors in the Seven Kingdoms, and sneaky killer Arya, couldn't take em, but it would be a tough fight, leaving no one unscathed by the end. But in this episode, Sandor and Arya dispatch them effortlessly, like they're no more than common scum. I don't see why they were written off like this when they should both still have major parts to play. I mean, why even bother including them in the first place?
Â 
This perfectly describes everything I hated about that scene it was awful.
1550	Er Rn	2014-05-19	Daario is beyond dull. I see no chemistry or sexual tension between him and Dany.
Gregor gutting the dudes for practice was trying too hard. Should've had brief glimpses of him terrorizing the Riverlands.
Melisandre and Selyse was just plain weird.
1551	Batman	2014-05-19	Â 
eh? a girl who was at her father's beheading and found out her brother and mother were murdered also?
Â 
thought it was a great line tbh. arya basically with zero cares about death anymore and a mature understanding of death itself - death is not something to fear, because you can't feel anything, it's literally nothing.


Â 
She clearly does not have depression. Its awful grief but that's not depression.Â
1552	Batman	2014-05-19	Well, they needed another way for Sandor to get an infected wound so they could wisely depict his and Arya's parting the same as in the book and they thought "Hey!Â  How about an infected human bite?!" and then they thought "Hey!Â  How about that guy 'Biter'?!!"Â  I mean, they we're obviously not going to have Brienne's confrontation with them in the show so they thought they'd tie up those two loose ends here.Â  To me, I guess it's alright becauseÂ it gets Sandor blood poisoning and eliminates another two minor characters but, yeah, it might mean not-so-good things for Brienne's storyline down the road.
Â 
Also, I actually thought Tyrion's reaction to Oberyn agreeing to champion him worked.Â  I mean, what else would Tyrion be feeling at that moment but incredible relief?Â  The Red Viper has a reputation as one of the foremost warriors in the realm and is even better than Bronn.Â  So Tyrion would just beÂ incredibly happy about this great stroke of luck Â Â 


Â 
I just did not buy it. There are some times when his acting is spectacular and sometimes I feel underwhelmed. Its not Bryan Cranston where I think he knocks it out of the park every week. Last week spectacular, this week underwhelming for me.Â
1553	Batman	2014-05-19	Closing out their arcs.Â  Otherwise, you'd have fans speculating that Biter is going to sit the Iron Throne.Â  Also, Arya's not ready to kill a stranger for no reason, and they are playing up "the list" for purposes of referring to it with DyingHound.


Â 
It was going to be closed out down the line, its not something most people would worry about. Just book readers who know the score. I think Arya killing to survive is enough. Plus, any cut is enough to become infected, it does not need to be a big thing. Â
1554	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-05-19	Only complaint is the Teddy Bear that Rides.
1555	ohpooratlas	2014-05-19	Jon wanting to seal the gates. Jon is now Bowen Marsh. Is he going to kill himself?


Â 
Bwahahaha, this made me laugh.
Â 
My only nitpicks really were:
+ Arya's dumb nihilism monologue.
+ Only cat - minor nitpick for me
+ Everything at the Eyrie felt rushed. I wanted MOAR crazy Lysa before her eventual send off.Â 
+ Oberyn's father taking him to Casterly Rock. Um ... no.Â

Â 
I guess this was a decent episode with nothing too horrible in it.Â  A few missed opportunities, but perhaps the best of the lot this season.Â
1557	lostinwesteros	2014-05-19	Yeah, at first I thought the conversation Arya had with the dying man was kinda ho-hum, but as I think further, it occurs to me that Arya's "Nothing is nothing" can serve as a precursor to her "I'm nobody" in the House of Black and White. Â And when she identified herself as Arya Stark in that same scene, I thought her expression and tone of voice gave perfect witness to what she's experienced and how deadened she's becoming as a result. Â 
Â 
My nitpick is with the new Gregor Clegane. Â I think he'sÂ terrible and completely unrealistic. Â Here he presents all of a sudden as Goliath???
1558	LionsAndTitsAndWineOhMy	2014-05-19	"Hey, Queen Cersei. Â Just killing some scrubs. Â Why? Â Oh, I dunno...they're criminals? Â I heard them make fun of your teats? Â Does it matter? Â Oh, and do you like how I went from psychotic menacing to pro-wrestling menacing?"
Â 
"Hey, Queen Daenerys. Â I don't come off as really dangerous anymore. Â Nothing really special...I'm more like a generic good-looking scrub that's trying to hook up with you at a club, and you're still broken up about your Sun, Moon and St...oh, take my clothes off? Â Sure. Â That was easy."

I suppose it's part of his morning workout before breakfast.
Â 
Rorge and Biter's 10 second cameo. What the hell was that???
Rorge died really stupidly, and I hadn't realized Biter's neck had been snapped, I thought he was just lying there.Â 
Â 
Melisandre sure has a beautiful body, but that scene was basically just eye candy and was useless.Â 
Â 
After all the nudity and sex, they didn't give us a Daario-Dany sex scene? Just why?
And the way it happened.
I didn't see a young girl seduced by a cocky man slut.
I saw a pair of experienced adults as if they were about to have a casual fling or a one night stand at a bar.
Â 
And the way Dany poured wine and said "Take off your clothes"?
After that I half expected some seductive music and Daario to do some stupid little dance.Â

1565	We Pay Our Debts	2014-05-20	I agree with the other posts here that the 'Nothing is nothing' line was god-awful. It was almost as bad as the line with Tyrion calling Shae 'friend' in episode 2.Â  
Â 
The lack of 'Only Cat' pissed me off as well. While the scene wasn't bad, I was underwhelmed.
Â 
It's also weird how they decided to follow Cersei's treatment of Tyrion in the books now, with the mention of her twisting Tyrion's dick, considering her relationship with Tyrion had been significantly changed in Season 2 and 3, and her character was made a lot less twisted. It felt out of character for Show Cersei, IMO.
Â 
And while I enjoyed Daenerys commanding Daario to undress (considering the overwhelming amount of sex scenes in this series shows females naked and males clothed), I hate how they weren't shown having sex, or at least making out. These writers honestly do not know how to fucking deal with sex scenes. They add unnecessary sex and nudity, change a clearly consensual sex scene into an ambiguously rapey sex scene, and cut a sex scene out from the books. WTF, seriously.

No. Us book readers complain about a sex scene that was consensual in the books being changed into a scene that can be interpreted as a rape because of the fact that it goes against the way the character was written. Rape being portrayed is not the problem. It's the context.

Â 
People also complained about the rape threats towards Meera.
Â 
At the same time though, many felt that the show kept using rape too much as a shock factor and as a plot device, and that these scenes seem to exist more to glorify the males rescuing them rather than to show the pain of the rape victims.
Â 
While I don't agree 100% with these criticisms, I do find these scenes to be unnecessary. I dislike how the writers made up these scenes which don't make the show any better, or develop any characters, yet significantly tone down Ramsay's hunts where he rapes and flays the women, which I found to be important to Ramsay's character. I don't think the viewers truly understand how depraved Ramsay is. I mean, they could've at least had him talk about flaying his victim, or shown him about to rape her.
Â 
It annoys me when the writers claim they don't have enough time to adapt the books, yet waste their time with a bunch of bullshit scenes, and cut out a lot of important scenes that were in the books. So to me, it's not the fact that what was depicted was rape that irked me, but rather how superfluous the scenes were.

One of the reviews used the term "casual rape" for the Craster's scene. Rape is not background noise, and it's also not necessary as the go to, let's add this to a scene.

It's even more absurd when you consider that Brienne mentioned Catelyn by name in the same episode. Y'know, just in case viewers had forgotten about her. And then... that.
1571	Nami	2014-05-20	Anyone else is bothered as fuck that Brienne is a highborn woman and doesn't seem to know shit about Houses and their past conflicts? I mean, Pod was giving her a lesson and all. Wtf was that?
1572	Orys Lothston	2014-05-20	I think I've only seen one mention of this but Hot Pie telling Brienne and Pod that Arya was alive and in the Riverlands just completely undermined her story arc with everyone assuming her to be dead.
1573	AZAXD	2014-05-20	Â 
A gratuitous nude scene is one thing, but this is supposed to be a super physical lustful relationship and we see nothing? Not a kiss or an embrace or anything? Â LOL, they must have zero chemistry in person as well as on screen.


Yeah if I recall correctly, Emilia was like she doesn't wanna just be throwing her titties around willy nilly - wanted to be known "for her acting rather than her breasts" I believe. Should've happened. Lame.
1574	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-20	The mountain looked too young and I didn't really understand who he was killing or why he was killing them.
Â 
The ONE SEX SCENE THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE, THEY DIDN'T? WTF! So we can get pointless brothel scenes that are BORING AS FUCK, we can get HORRIBLE rape scenes in order to fill the boob quota but when we get a sex scene between two characters that is consensual, a sex scene that makes perfect sense and isn't simply filler, and then what...HBO DON'T show it? WTF! Weird.Â 
Â 
Jon Snow arguing for the gates to be barred, instead of against? Again, just a bit jarring for a book reader.
Â 
What was up with Rorge just standing there looking like a useless lump talking to Sandor and then just standing there as Arya kills him? lol, wtf.
Â 
''Call me petyr'' /laughing/
1575	Brother Walfrid	2014-05-20	- That Arya monologue about nothing.... my goodness was that cringeworthy. It tried way too hard to be pseudo-philosophical and deep, and just fell flat and failed.Â 
Â 
Apparently that whole scene just lifted dialogue straight out of Becket's Waiting For Godot and the dying man is a noted stage actor who specialises in doing Becket plays

1577	Miodrag	2014-05-20	Acting in GOT is continually praised in these forums, but Pedro Pascal's performance in this episode possibly indicates acting in the show is generally overrated. In that scene with Tyrion, Pascal had something that great many other GOT actors lack: passion. As I can remember, we haven't seen that since Season 1 (Momoa, Bean, Addy, Dinklage) and first half of Season 2 (Allen) - aside from Nikolaj's occasional miniatures that can't be more frequent because of the writing, it seems. Not every character has to be played passionately, of course (not all of them are written that way, after all), but this show seriously lacks passion, in both writing and acting. Pascal's performance was therefore very refreshing and welcomed, for me at least. Of course, that his lines are taken from the source material greatly helped.

Â 
Completely agreed. With almost every actor on the show, I don't see the character, just the actor (especiallyÂ Maisie). But with Pascal, I genuinely only see Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper. He justÂ isÂ the character, like Bryan Cranston so effortlessly became Walter White. A mark of a truly great performance.Â
1579	brazen grace	2014-05-20	When, Oh WHEN, are we going to see Daario fondle his knives with a wicked grin? Â His relationship with Dany was so intense in the books, it actually made me skip ahead a few pages and then go back. Â They really need to re-cast the role, because these two go together like a fish and a bicycle.

Even if we have three episodes left, I am sure Pedro Pascal's acting this episode is the best we will get this season, with Tyrion's trial and the amazing Dinklage.

Â 
True. Can't blame the actors too much, though, because the writing's so loaded with cynicism they're practically forced to act dispassionately. Just look at what they did to Brienne: she's a chastising machine. And also, countless of passionate characters from the books are either cut (Robb's retinue) or changed (Edmure and Tullys in general, Loras, and so on).

Â 
With that shot of him spinning like in a circus, his fight against Gregor may be underwhelming in general, so yeah, this was possibly the last piece of great acting by Pascal in this show. But, I disagree about Dinklage. Now, acting is a rather tricky territory, it always depends on a personal taste, so what I liked you were possibly untouched by and vice versa, but - I was not satisfied with Dinklage's acting ever since Season 1 (even there he struggled in the early episodes, but he was very good after Cat captured him). My impression is that in the last couple of years he was acting primarily for awards. That's why I liked him in the scene with Pascal, because he let Pascal lead - and, with minimal face expressions, Dinklage finally managed to convey powerful emotions (the trial scene was the very opposite, if you ask me).
1583	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-20	We should renamed this thread "why do I subject my self to things I don't like?"
1584	Miodrag	2014-05-20	Also: TV Tyrion thinks TV Shae never loved him! Really?! Never? Not even when she refused the diamonds so she could be with him? So, what was their show-consuming love story for? What purpose those countless scenes of their mutual love served, if TV Tyrion states that he was stupid enough to believe she loved him? Is that one more example of the show "slightly deviating" but eventually "hitting the same marks as the books"?! Most definitely, if they don't make some drastic changes in their story in the future.

1590	The Boar of Gore	2014-05-20	Â 
I find they usually do fine when they change around dialogue or invent scenes that deal with character only or make slight variations on the basic premise. Â Where they really falter for me is when they make changes to the plot...they're terrible at this...the plot changes are generally silly and full of huge plot holes and gaps in logic and continuity.


Â 
Holy fuck. QFT. They need someone who can step back and say wait a minute, this is stupid, this makes no sense, this is something this character would never do, etc.
Â 
I thought of another nitpick to add to the ones I mentioned earlier on this thread: no Marillion. More to the point, LF just killed Lysa, but he has no patsy to blame. Is he supposed to be able to just waltz into the Vale and kill its acting lord with no consequences??
1591	solidviper	2014-05-20	I didn't consider it a nitpick before, but with LF's whole speech, with him saying "only" a lot. "Only Cat" would've sounded/flowed so much better than "your sister."

Well, then we disagree with Dinklage. The way he said "I saved you. I saved this city, and all your worthless lifes. I should have let Stannis kill you all", and the face he had, is, IMO, the best acting he has ever given in this show. I suggest you watching it again and you'll see

1594	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-20	I was sure Sweet Robin was going to go into a shaking fit after Sansa slapped him. Apparently he's as healthy as any boy his age in Westeros....and he honestly hasn't seemed as annoyingly needy and bratty as I expected. Maybe the stress ofÂ  current events ramp up his generally shitty disposition and bring about some seizures.

I should have let Stannis kill you all", and the face he had, is, IMO, the best acting he has ever given in this show. I suggest you watching it again and you'll see It was fantastic but it was the first burst of true bitterness and venom we have seen from show tyrion so I can also understand why some people might have found it out of place or hammy, but I loved it. I just wish we had had glimpses of this side of tyrion before, theyre definitely there in the books. Hes not that nice. Hes been too nice in the show up until then so that snarling, venemous hateful man was maybe a bit jarring for some people.
1596	Miodrag	2014-05-20	Just another reason why season 1 is the best. The chemistry between Addy and Bean hasn't been matched since. Whenever those two were on screen it was gold. Also Aiden Gillen actually had a normal voice in season 1 


Â 
Yeah, they were both great, though Addy lacked some height, which could've been fixed quite easily with some high heels - he'd be perfect Robert that way, considering how good he was anyway. As for Bean, I find him very underrated in these forums. People go on and on about how this actor or that actor does a "phenomenal" job, but honestly, what Bean achieved is possibly unmatched. He carried the main storyline for the first nine episodes. Momoa was great, but he was a side character, just like Dinklage was in Season 1. I hate those snobbish descriptions like "he acted for other actors", but in Bean's case it can be rightully said. Aside from his not-loud-enough voice in which he delivered his final speech in "Baelor" (just a minor complain, the scene was very good overall), I can't find a fault in his performance. Even that terrible wig they forced on him couldn't ruin the character.
Â 
As for Gillen, I can't explain him. He was great in The Wire. He can deliver. What he does in GOT is amateurish. And, from what I know, he likes the books very much. He read all of them, and discussed his character with Martin. Perhaps that is the problem - Littlefinger is radically changed on TV, even Martin couldn't help but say so, and maybe that influences Gillen's performance. Just a thought.

His delivery of "I didn't do it" was what ruined his performance in that scene for me. But, once again, to each his own, acting is just too vague as a skill in general.

1618	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-20	I will add my nitpicks:
LF didn't say Only Cat. Wish he did but it doesn't matter unless you've read the books. 
Sansa is a clear 4" taller than LF. 
Erm... Gregor looks too young. 
Other than that... Nowt really comes to mind.
1619	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-20	I remember feeling quite disappointed after the episode...
Â 
however, most people i've spoken to seem to really have like it, including the unsullied ones...so i'm willing to re-watch and reconsider...
Â 
the general vibe i got was they figured its a long weekend ep, so less viewers than usual, so less story so ppl dont miss too much...
Â 
off the top of my head, i did not enjoy Mel/Seylse scene at all...i understand the importance of showing Mel's "powers" and the tricks up her sleeves (pun intended) but was unnecessary to draw it out that long and the creepy seylse checking out mel's body and all that...i am intrigued by why she wants shireen on the voyage but just felt it was like one of those scenes "okaaay...somethings gona happen, just watch..." and then poof its overÂ 
Â 
same goes for Arya/Hound scene...felt very repetitive...rehashing hounds story so people feel more sympathetic towards him...then arya repeating her awesome "nothing is nothing" line...was that really necessary? and wtf was up with the Biter, first jumps the hound...then just stands there chatting like its a nice summer day, within swinging distance of Arya...if he's that vicious how come he didnt just kill arya as soon as she got within sword distance...i liked the close up of the wound to explain why it festers and kills him, but again...could have been directed better imo
Â 
dany/daario...wasnt dany against body-slaves and all that? she's basically using him as one one...how does that fit? or r they trying to show how power is getting to her head and she's starting to break her own rules? i get they needed to show them hooking up and i figured she's not doing any more nudity, but i really expected it to be a more passionate, lost herself in the moment kind of thing...at least intense flirting with both of them really close and end up kissing and she starts tearing off his clothes...that would have worked better no?Â 
Â 
dont care about jorah/dany scene...just rehashing how much she values his opinion to emphasize the depth of her hurt at his betrayal..was short enough that i was ok with it
Â 
i liked all the KL scenes...Jaime/Tyrion, Cersei/Mountain, Bronn/Tyrion, Oberyn/Tyrion....i rmr liking all of it, other than oberyn picking up the torch and claiming "i will be your champion", everything other than the torch in his hand that way, that was just tooo cliche i felt...anyway, small thing, no biggie...
Â 
and ofcourse the final scene...my unsullied friends really loved all of it, but mostly their focus is on LF creepy kiss with Sansa and super happy at Lysa flying to her death...people dont seem to be focusing on LF and just how insanely devious and ruthless he is.
Â 
This is exactly the kind of thing i was worried about that they haven't focused enough on the Vale to show this scene to really take in the importance of it. i was hoping for maybe a 15-20 minute scene at the vale so they can really focus on all of it...but Sansa in the snow till Lysa's death was probably less than 6 mins...i wont lie, hearing "your sister" vs. "only cat" was a let down, but i guess thats just because of how badly i was expecting it and its just such a small thing, i never expected D&D to change that...but even LF's build up to that moment seemed rushed and kind of unexpected in respect to what Lysa was screaming about...sort off
Â 
i'll re-watch with an open mind, will see if i feel differently...
1620	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-20	Too late mate, already had this discussion 
Vale scene was too short. 
lysa isn't fat
She screamed when she shouldn't
Sweet Robin is too old
No armour is porcelain 
Tbh, what I don't get, is the hound. He's super nice In the show compared to the novels, but no one complains about. Honestly he's far to nice. Still love Rory McCann in the part though.
1621	Le Cygne	2014-05-20	Again, links with the Emilia no nudity rumors, or it didn't happen.  
I agree, they are not showing relationships well in the show.  But rewatch the Dany and Daario scenes, despite what she's saying, when he's not watching, and sometimes when he is, she's showing she likes him, too.  I don't know why they went on a so subtle everyone misses it kick this season, but they did.
1622	Chebyshov	2014-05-20	Again, links with the Emilia no nudity rumors, or it didn't happen.

Â 
Is this true? Because if so, then where are the "whitewashing Sandor" posts?Â
1624	'96Buck	2014-05-20	same goes for Arya/Hound scene...felt very repetitive...rehashing hounds story so people feel more sympathetic towards him...then arya repeating her awesome "nothing is nothing" line...was that really necessary? and wtf was up with the Biter, first jumps the hound...then just stands there chatting like its a nice summer day, within swinging distance of Arya...if he's that vicious how come he didnt just kill arya as soon as she got within sword distance...i liked the close up of the wound to explain why it festers and kills him, but again...could have been directed better imo

Â 


Sandor killed Biter instantly...Rorge, now faced with 1:1 rather than 2:1, in a standup fight instead of an ambush, is understandably reassessing his approach.Â  He doesn't consider a little girl to be a problem.
Â 
Dany is responding to Daario's advances, how is that using him as a body-slave?
1625	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-20	Â 
Is this true? Because if so, then where are the "whitewashing Sandor" posts?Â 

That's what I mean. Where are the complaints? 
He's such a nice guy in the show, and hilarious. 
He's more like Batman going on a kidnapping spree in the novels.
1626	Fat Trell	2014-05-20	Again, links with the Emilia no nudity rumors, or it didn't happen.
I agree, they are not showing relationships well in the show. But rewatch the Dany and Daario scenes, despite what she's saying, when he's not watching, and sometimes when he is, she's showing she likes him, too. I don't know why they went on a so subtle everyone misses it kick this season, but they did.


Â 
The bigger issue is tone. Dany tells Daario to take his clothes off in the same fashion she declares that slavery has ended.
1627	i_am_no_one	2014-05-20	Â 
Lysa flailing her arms while falling looked like some ACME sh-t. I swear, I expected a dusty poof when she hit the bottom.

HAAAAAAhahahahaha!!!!!!! 
Sorry but this made my fucking day. 
I agree with all the nitpicking. This was a horribly awkward episode, aside from Tyrion's scenes. I made my husband pause the show so I could RAGE at the "take off your clothes" remark. And again when Daario and Jorah pass each other the next morning, suggesting to the viewer that Dany and Daario did indeed do the deed. That passage in the book was SO. FUCKING. HOT. "What are you waiting for?" was the exact Dany line, IIRC. I hate showDany. They have dropped a huge ball with her character. There was so much potential. And I really feel that it is equally Emilia and D&D's doing. Shallow writing and wooden acting.

I guess that makes sense about Rorge, I did love Aryas tiny psychopathic smile as she stabs him in the heart...
It does seem like Daario is the one making the advances and shes just agreeing but the whole sitting on her high seat and commanding him to strip while she leers at him...tell me, if the roles were reversed and a guy in a superior position did that to a woman, it wouldn't seem crass? 
It didnt seem passionate or anything of the sort...more like, "yes I know I'm hot and this guys been pestering me for a while now, lets check out the package, im in need for a good fuck anyway...hmm seems ok...all right lets fuck" just seemed out of character for show!Dany
1630	Aethermancer	2014-05-20	Also: TV Tyrion thinks TV Shae never loved him! Really?! Never? Not even when she refused the diamonds so she could be with him?


Â 
TV Tyrion doesn't know about the diamonds.Â  There was even a scene about it where he was trying to figure out what she was talking about.
1631	brazen grace	2014-05-20	Â 
Holy fuck. QFT. They need someone who can step back and say wait a minute, this is stupid, this makes no sense, this is something this character would never do, etc.
Â 
I thought of another nitpick to add to the ones I mentioned earlier on this thread: no Marillion. More to the point, LF just killed Lysa, but he has no patsy to blame. Is he supposed to be able to just waltz into the Vale and kill its acting lord with no consequences??


The "they need someone" reminds me of all the Star Wars fans wishing George Lucas would stop directing Star Wars films, because although he has an awesome imagination, he is a terrible director. Â Now that Disney has its claws in it, <shrug> be careful what you wish for, I guess..
Â 
I also picked up on the absence of Marillion. Â Wonder if Petyr will stay that Lysa just "fell" out the door? Â That would tie everything up neatly, since they didn't waste time developing the relationship between Lysa and Marillion .

I think they have her as WAY too sexually sure of herself right now.Â
1640	Dorne Sand	2014-05-20	I really don't mind most of the changes. the arya pre training is interesting much more than her sitting with an old man for many episodes. I don't see for them another way to show here becoming a cool hearted killer. Same for the sex scene with darioo and thougth they managed very well for exemple the annoyance of jorah even though he shouldn't be here anymore. Showing some gratuis violence for the mountain can also be explained even though it is a bi vulgar as a process.
Â 
What really annoys me is how hey kepping messing up the wall arc. It is intersting to see the tension building up there but why make it about a argument that jon himself was very much against in the books? I mean there are a lot of arguments that could be made. Why this one?
Â 
And yet not a word about not finding Bran, which was supposedly the main reason for him to go to crasters keep. We keep having these same scene where jon desagrees with alister, jon is rebuked and humilated and nothing much.
Â 
there is also the fact that all the watch seems oblivious to the facts that there are wildlings south of the wall...weird.
Â 
even on a show viewer onlyÂ  perspective this arc doesn't make much sense

Â 
Yeah, Ygritte and Jon was weird, Sansa and Sandor(if you consider that romantic) was poorly done, Jaime and Cersei is...rapey, Loras and Renly was campy, etc.

No, because we're privy to her thoughts. TV as a medium has a way of flattening scenes, but I'd imagine the dialogue would be delivered in a same fashion. Also I kind of read it as her being randy/kinky. I see the complaints, but it's not one I share (maybe because I kind of hated the entire Daario subplot anyway).

i did as well, but the way i think of it, if they are going to do it, do it right...im ok with not showing the whole sex scene as it is pointless to the main plot....but come on..."do what you do best...take off your clothes" very very lame

my issue is that it brings down the quality of the showÂ

1645	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-20	Dany and Daario is shit in the books as well tbf. D&D are covering it well.

Â 
So, you're positive he wasn't pretending in front of Shae? OK, but then, what about the actual diamonds? Where there any diamonds at all? And if yes, where did they came from? Varys?!
1647	Er Rn	2014-05-20	Daario is an absolute douchebag in the books. 
But, I can see why Dany is infatuated with him. She's having a shit time and he provides her with some distraction and relief. This is after she's experimented with herself and Irri and is unsatisfied because it's not passionate. Plus he's got the bad boy thing going for him. 
In the show, their relationship is just dull. No chemistry, no tension, nothing. I have a hard time believing this Daario could make Dany scream.
1648	Nami	2014-05-20	Â 
Yeah, they were both great, though Addy lacked some height, which could've been fixed quite easily with some high heels - he'd be perfect Robert that way, considering how good he was anyway. As for Bean, I find him very underrated in these forums. People go on and on about how this actor or that actor does a "phenomenal" job, but honestly, what Bean achieved is possibly unmatched. He carried the main storyline for the first nine episodes. Momoa was great, but he was a side character, just like Dinklage was in Season 1. I hate those snobbish descriptions like "he acted for other actors", but in Bean's case it can be rightully said. Aside from his not-loud-enough voice in which he delivered his final speech in "Baelor" (just a minor complain, the scene was very good overall), I can't find a fault in his performance. Even that terrible wig they forced on him couldn't ruin the character.
Â 
As for Gillen, I can't explain him. He was great in The Wire. He can deliver. What he does in GOT is amateurish. And, from what I know, he likes the books very much. He read all of them, and discussed his character with Martin. Perhaps that is the problem - Littlefinger is radically changed on TV, even Martin couldn't help but say so, and maybe that influences Gillen's performance. Just a thought.


Â 
Harry Lloyd was also brilliant as Viserys, but seem to be underrated
The cast from season 1 was great
Â 
I don't think PD is that awesome. I could agree with that in season 2, but after so many kiss assing it seems his acting got worse and forced sometimes.

Also... Ygritte hates Jon so much on the show, I don't see how the death scene will work now. One of the classic parts of love stories is the time apart. I have a feeling Jaime and Brienne will forget each other just like Sansa and Sandor did.  Loras forgot about Renly in record time.  I could go on...

Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would close his eyes and begin to snor e softly and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised and sore, hurting too much for sleep. Day followed day, and night followed night, until Dany knew she could not endu re a moment longer. She would kill herself rather than go on, she decided one night . . .

4. Â Never enough Hot Pie, and it is best with extra gravy and bread.



It's awkward to admit but... seeing Hot Pie again was my favorite moment so far this season. Better than Tyrion's trial, Joffrey's death, Jaime and Brienne saying goodbye, etc. Ben Hawkey is awesome! Hot Pie is awesome! 
Â 
Â 


5. Â Depending on the scene, I'm back and forth on the nudity issue. Â It's the rape overload that was getting to me previously. Â You know it's too much rape when half the participants look as bored as they did at Craster's Keep. Â With Mel, I've come to the conclusion that part of her character is comfortableness with herself, nudity abounds. Â What will be funny is.........with that notion of her comfort in her own skin, I'll LMAO if it's just a glamoured boob job. Â   Â Yeah, yeah, I know, no ruby last night in the tub, maybe that's what the blue juju juice was for? Â 


Perhaps, it still annoyed me though. The scene in itself was off, but the fact that she was nude made it even worse. I didn't really feel character advancement with that scene.
Â 
Â 


Â 
6. Â This number is the main reason I wanted to answer, the opening credits. Â A, they are getting lazy, and B, the new angle flyover opening that they've tried to be too cute with.........is half the reason I think they don't pay the same attention to changing up locales each episode. Â I just wonder if that plays into it, the new angle, which annoys the hell out of me.
Â 
Well, I wanted to answer the post for Hot Pie, for Number 6, and to say HI to you and The Ned. Â ~Waves Hi~

True, they were following the books for the most part back then.
Ehhh.

This isn't the place for a Dany/Drogo debate, but we see that differently.
I think not telling Drogo about the saddle sores was because of Viserys threatening her, once she kicked Viserys to the curb, she told Drogo what to do  and he did it.

Disagree. The show version was a lot more believable, this is one huge improvement D&D made. IIRC there is even an old interview where GRRM says that if he could rewrite one scene from the entire books, it would be the wedding scene.

Ya, I could make an argument defending the show's choices for their wedding night, which is why I linked that text, but not the thread for that. I don't disagree about your reading of Dany above, however.Â 
Â 
And I strongly agree that they mishandle most romances on this show. Weirder still, the ones they choose to spend time fleshing out are ones that either don't exist in the books (Robb/Talisa) or aren't super romantic (Jon/Ygritte, Tyrion/Shae). It's actually a bit mystifying how much screen time they were willing to spend on these couples, when other pairings were basically cut out (looking at you, Sansan, though I think D&D may have had a discomfort characterizing that relationship as a "romance").Â
1658	Hound's She-wolf	2014-05-20	That's what I mean. Where are the complaints?
He's such a nice guy in the show, and hilarious.
He's more like Batman going on a kidnapping spree in the novels.


Â 
I loudly and frequently complained about his character being so different from the books, two seasons ago. I like to complain, but even I can't keep bitching about the same stuff for four seasons.

Please no. I'm already bitter they're cutting all her character development and backstory.
I do have a tiny bit of hope though as they'll meet again and it's definitely one of the most "asserted" romance among the show crew.
1660	Le Cygne	2014-05-20	IIRC there is even an old interview where GRRM says that if he could rewrite one scene from the entire books, it would be the wedding scene.

Better to have links and be sure before (mis)quoting people.  Recently he seemed quite proud of the wedding night scene, and I think it was written beautifully:"What happens later in the books is Drogo and Dany ride out to to consummate their marriage... You have Dany and Drogo riding out, and they find this little secluded spot, there's a stream. And Drogo doesn't speak any English, so they're talking to each other, and she says is no the only word you know. And they undress, and there's a sex scene which was pretty sexy and fairly romantic."
http://www.ustream.t...corded/21681757looking at you, Sansan

That's one of my favorite romances in the series, also Jaime and Brienne, I love Beauty and the Beast stories, and these are very originally and beautifully told in the books. I think they will keep telling theses stories, in their own ways, I have seen signs, but some key parts from the book stories would make them so much fun to watch, they are sitting on gold and don't seem to know it.
1661	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-20	This is just my opinion but it says a lot that the negative nitpick thread is about 10 times the length of positive one.
I think the existence of the show is a cause for celebration, not endlessly nitpicking.
It's not perfect I admit. Far from it. Just hmmm... I read the same users slagging the same elements of the show off every week.


Â 
Personally, I don't often do the positive nitpick thread because it is a spoiler-free thread. Â I prefer to discuss the show without having to self edit, for me the thread choices aren't about positive vs negative, it's about book vs nonbook content. Â I post positive views all over the damn place, probably in this very thread, LOL Â

The time they are apart is so important, they seem to have an out of sight, out of mind storytelling philosophy.  
I could name a bunch of romances, we all could, where there's that middle part where they miss each other and realize what's important,  Jane Eyre is a classic example (and he lifted quite a bit of this for Sansa/Sandor in particular).  Jaime and Brienne is another BatB, and the time apart is pivotal, it's key to the whole story.   Looks like they are going to blow right past it for them, too.
It's like, if they don't kiss and/or jump into the sack, they aren't interested.  But people love stories like these.
The scene where Jaime smacks Red Ronnet is classic, what do you want to bet that goes the way of "I dreamed of you."

Â 
I think such a large amount of that gold is in Sansa's chapters, so it's sad to see them get the back burner. Even this episode, so little time was spent in the Eyrie to properly set it up (my biggest and only real nitpick about this episode) versus how much time we spent at Craster's, KL for Tyrion's trial, etc. My own feelings about the Beauty and Beast trope aside, one of the most powerful chapters in the series was the unkiss chapter. It's really to their disadvantage that they didn't use it.

It's depressing. I've pretty much given upÂ hope on Sandor and Sansa, don't disappoint me with Jaime and Brienne, HBO !
I'll have to consider Brienne's inability to get her hand off Oathkeeper in this ep the best they can do. And yes, I'm expecting the Goldenslap to go through the Moon Door as well.
Â 
As for Sansa, she does slightly better than last season, but there've been so much missed opportunities...

I would have thought that Sandor's 'oh so instructive' whack across the face to Arya last week might have taken care of any whitewashing remarks in relation to The Hound. Â We do lots of picking at nits in relation to The Hound, the code for instance? Â I guess he doesn't steal from those that employ him "The Lannisters, Joffrey" but does steal from strangers?? Â Which, he doesn't do, steal from strangers......unless they are already dead and don't need it, ie.......the Piper bannerman that the mercy killing this week was supposed to be a fill in for. Â But, some of those complaints are about the opposite of 'whitewashing,' I suppose? Â

1666	Le Cygne	2014-05-20	It's really to their disadvantage that they didn't use it.

The unkiss is such an original and awesome subplot. And it's so Sansa to resist Machiavelli by telling herself a story about a kiss, how cool is that.
They could easily add it, even now, give Sansa some very much needed depth.

1667	Chebyshov	2014-05-20	It's depressing. I've pretty much given upÂ hope on Sandor and Sansa, don't disappoint me with Jaime and Brienne, HBO !
I'll have to consider Brienne's inability to get her hand off Oathkeeper in this ep the best they can do. And yes, I'm expecting the Goldenslap to go through the Moon Door as well.
Â 
As for Sansa, she does slightly better than last season, but there've been so much missed opportunities...


Â 
I'd say them casting a 40 year old actor to play Sandor probably kissed that one goodbye. As for Jaime and Brienne, they're clearly playing it up, so I'm assuming we'll see some sort of payoff there.
1668	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-20	Â 
i wouldn't have been surprised if she did...i was honestly expecting she would say "give us a twirl love"Â 


Â 
Perfect, LOL, but I bet they'd skip the little 'love' endearment. Â
1669	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-20	Â

Â 
I'm just so loveable Â  
Â 
Â 
Â 
I fully agree : )
Â 
Â 
Â 
Perhaps we could settle on both not wearing any clothes at all?
Â 
Â 
Â 
It's awkward to admit but... seeing Hot Pie again was my favorite moment so far this season. Better than Tyrion's trial, Joffrey's death, Jaime and Brienne saying goodbye, etc. Ben Hawkey is awesome! Hot Pie is awesome! 
Â 
Â 
Perhaps, it still annoyed me though. The scene in itself was off, but the fact that she was nude made it even worse. I didn't really feel character advancement with that scene.
Â 
Â 
It's a shame really, the opening credits are so awesome, but they just don't use them like they should.
Â 
And hi back to you and Jaqen 
Â 


Â 
You, The Ned, Roddy the Ruin, and all the HOTPIE!! Â  
Â 
I do want the opening credits and it's over reaching flyover arc to just go away, but still, at least the Braavos addition looks good (if not well-timed episode by episode) but still, the damn angle isn't doing the city and the credits much good. Â Love the coin, though, going over the aqua ducts. Â

Re. Sandor and Sansa I never expected (or wanted tbh) it to be explicit (whether in books or show) or to fully develop into something physically romantic, but they still could've developed more what is in my opinion one of the most interesting dynamics in the story.

1675	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-20	The time they are apart is so important, they seem to have an out of sight, out of mind storytelling philosophy.
I could name a bunch of romances, we all could, where there's that middle part where they miss each other and realize what's important, Jane Eyre is a classic example (and he lifted quite a bit of this for Sansa/Sandor in particular). Jaime and Brienne is another BatB, and the time apart is pivotal, it's key to the whole story. Looks like they are going to blow right past it for them, too.
It's like, if they don't kiss and/or jump into the sack, they aren't interested. But people love stories like these.The scene where Jaime smacks Red Ronnet is classic, what do you want to bet that goes the way of "I dreamed of you."


Â 
Â 
Don't forget Red Ronnet spitting out the blood, I'm also hoping a tooth or two came out with the blood flow. Â It was dark, Jaime might have missed it. Â I'm not overly optimistic that the scene won't be cut or changed, but.....I suspect we might have a chance at having a Red Ronnet, what with Aegon the Uncertain and Jon Connington and a second Dance of the Dragons. Â Maybe?? Â I'm NEVER too hopeful, but we might get a chance of something along those lines, a whack from Goldenhand to some well deserving male in Lady Brienne's name. Â

It's 15 years difference in the books, same as Jaime and Brienne, I think based on all the romantic setup, and you have to wade through it, it's heading in that direction, never saw so much build up for a kiss.

Â 
LOL, yeah.......I'm letting myself be amused by the smallest things in relation to the awful readjustment in relation to the opening credits. Â I've liked Braavos, for me it's more about the city than the Titan. Â I think GRRM went a little overboard on the Titan, but I do fall in love more and more with the city of Braavos itself every time I reread. Â Loved the latest 'Mercy' chapter. Â I full admit, I can be quite cheesy, so no problem on that differing opinion, not for me. Â  Â  Â

I'd agree, except that GRRM is constantly subverting expectations, so if they never do I wouldn't be shocked. But yeah, the build up is there, and definitely plausible. The problem was they cast about a 27 year age difference, which is why I think they didn't touch it in the show. They kept some elements of it, probably as nice winks to the book readers, but if it does culminate in something sexual, I don't see them going there.

Yes, just smack someone for dissing Brienne, please.  But that it was him wandering to the bearpit before he even knew where he was headed, and someone else who had been there before him (loaded with meaning, this was Brienne's former betrothed) was doing the same, staring at the bearpit and thinking of Brienne.  And then the funniest part, Jaime practically banished him because he didn't want to see his face again.

Basically this. Not saying it's a definite no for the books, as GRRM doesn't shy away from consequent age gaps, but on the show it's very unlikely.

Yep, also being all offended because Brienne never mentioned being betrothed. When was she supposed to do that, exactly ? Â Â

There's this old song where the guy keeps singing "I'm not in love" that reminds me of Jaime's POV, and that was one of those moments where there was pay off.   The nice thing about the show is that NCW is Jaime, he can play it all (if they'd write it for him to play).

Oh, you don't have to sell me on it, I loved it all. Â I am a little hopeful we might get something of it, maybe even more than we think. Â It's just best to keep those low expectations sometimes. Â I figure, they have put alot of effort into making a Harrenhal, into making a bearpit, and well, Jaime has to go someplace on his tour of the Riverlands, right? Â Red Ronnet himself might not be a long shot, what with the Aegon and Jon Connington issues. Â We have a chance, maybe a small chance, that we could get lots of the deal.
Â 
I loved the bannishment, too. Â I suspect Jaime knew he'd be tempted to kick his ass every time he looked at the dude's face. Â Too bad he wants to TRY his hand at decency.......I'd have liked another parting whack. Â Still, I'll keep my vision of a couple teeth scattered in Red Ronnet's blood at the bottom of the bearpit. Â 
Â 
While we are on the subject, I just love how much Jaime hated Harrenhal on his return, and all the reasons why, from his youth and The Tourney of the False Spring......up until him not getting much enjoyment out of Goat, roasted or not. Â I suspect we may just revisit the place with him, it'll just remind me of all the missing pieces of the story already, but still, we might get some good stuff out of Nikolai. Â His understated, at times, awesomeness as Jaime just amazes me. Â His mere look at Tyrion this past episode.........when Tyrion says the line about being foolish enough to believe a whore loved him back, made me think we just might get the whole Tysha story from Jaime when he finally goes to free Tyrion. Â Just a look, and Nikolai made me hope. Â I should be mad, at the hope he gives me, but I'm not, LOL Â

I've been catching up and this just brought the laugh tear ducts alive! Thank you.
Â 
You may have just hit on the whole thing perfectly. Book readers are the roadkill gawkers of the tv show. Hence, nitpicking threads.
Â 
This episode was interesting. Many others have pointed out the lowlights. The simplified, single-minded jump start, jump start to each story is beginning to leave me cold. The added scenes, the twists they've chosen to take, the lack of depth in characterization is drawing me away from the show, not into the show.
Â 
It seems this season has reflected in even more detail the threads that were starting to pull away at the seams last season. The show is starting to make missteps, errors in perception and decisions that beg some explanation. For instance, was all the Shae love required when, in the end, she does what she does? The pointless nudity with non-lead characters when the leads won't take off their clothes (or won't anymore?) on HBO? I guess 'to the point' nudity is not relevant. Pointless violence of the Mountain in the streets of King's Landing just to show his 'terrifying' nature? There were plenty of other possibilities that would have felt more real.
Â 
I wanted to see the gritty-reality fantasy. The one where the characters are grey and the decisions they make have wide-reaching effect, though they may not know it. I liked the interconnectedness the characters had that the show has forgotten. Now that we're headed to the widest-ranging parts of the series where the characters are at the furthest distance from each other, I wonder how this show will accomplish that. Their inability to remember or talk about the characters that had meaning to them internally in the books is something I would like to see addressed.
1702	Bear Island	2014-05-20	I might be alone in thinking this, but to me a far better way of re-introducing the Mountain would have been to have a scene in a pub with some common folk talking about the horrors that the Mountain has visited upon the Riverlands (rape, murder, stealing, plundering, burning villages and so forth). Maybe they could get a bit carried away talking about the Mountain (maybe talk about his preferences in women or how big his member is or something similar), and then everything gets quiet as the Mountain approaches the men from behind with his sword drawn, and we get a terrified plea for mercy and then a fade to black.
It's a bit hokey, but I think it would have been easier to swallow than what we were presented with, plus it would be a chance for the Unsullied to hear about how inhuman he is in strength, size and brutality.
1703	Newstar	2014-05-20	I didn't really get this sense from the books, but the TV version of the Mountain really reminds me of Mongo from Blazing Saddles. That scene from this episode with the Mountain gleefully terrorizing the peasants and his ballyhooed fearsomeness reminds me of the townsfolk's terror in Mongo's introduction scene in Blazing Saddles: "Never mind that shit...here comes Mongo!" and "If you shoot him, you'll just make him mad." It's pretty hard for me to take him seriously as an instrument of terror...and the fact that the Mountain 3.0 is so adorable does not help matters.

This. Also he reminds me of a wrestler called The Great Khali. Last time I watched him wrestling his gimmick was kiss cam, so... yeah. Finding it hard to take that baby faced Mongo-Khali seriously.

Also, it would've been a nightmare for those who translate the show. I don't think many languages have an equivalent to "wench", and one that wouldn't sound weird/ outdated. Don't know if it's taken into account by the writers though.

Still, I wish they had included it.
1706	Le Cygne	2014-05-21	Also, it would've been a nightmare for those who translate the show. I don't think many languages have an equivalent to "wench", and one that wouldn't sound weird/ outdated. Don't know if it's taken into account by the writers though.Still, I wish they had included it.It's supposed to sound outdated. It's supposed to be funny. I hear all the time people wish they'd included it. NCW could have delivered it perfectly. They've got that rare thing, an actor who can do serious and funny, even both at the same time, and pull it off. And they hardly take advantage of it at all. Jaime was one of the funniest guys in the books.Wench = "A young woman or girl, especially a peasant girl." They could translate it into "girl" - basically the thing he's wrestling with is giving her respect as a woman, and particularly as a female knight, which is what she values most, being accepted for who she is, and that's what she is. And he's responding to "Kingslayer" - he's saying, accept me, too.It's a classic exchange from the books (exchange = coming from both directions) millions of people loved and wanted to hear. They each come to get past their initial perceptions of the other. They see each other for who they are. That he zeroes in on wench as the perfect thing to get a rise out of her from the start says he's always seen her for who she is, on some level.Then when it comes time for the Red Ronnet scene (which they will also probably cut), when he says "Call her Brienne," he's saying he sees her for who she is, and not only that, he's telling everyone else to, too.I know you get it/like it too, just talking about it some more... It goes back to what we were saying about them losing lines, and losing something that made it a better story.

Â 
Be that as it may, the writers cut out a lot of things that worked on the books but would be OTT campy on the show--Daario's hair, one-breasted Qartheen gowns, GRRM's medieval speak, etc.--and words which would be lost on a modern audience due to the words having other associations (using "virgin" instead of "maid" in the recent Sansa episode). "Wench" is one of those things and one of those words.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Then when it comes time for the Red Ronnet scene (which they will also probably cut), when he says "Call her Brienne," he's saying he sees her for who she is, and not only that, he's telling everyone else to, too.
Â 
I hope they don't cut this bit, but I imagine Red Ronnet will either call Brienne a nasty derogatory word for a woman that a TV audience would find very offensive (bitch, cunt), or Red Ronnet will call Brienne a "beast," which is how TV Jaime referred to her when they met. (I honestly can't recall if TV Jaime used other nasty names for her beyond slinging around insults about her ugliness and such, which I guess would be a point in favour of using "Wench.")

1708	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-21	I didn't really get this sense from the books, but the TV version of the Mountain really reminds me of Mongo from Blazing Saddles. That scene from this episode with the Mountain gleefully terrorizing the peasants and his ballyhooed fearsomeness reminds me of the townsfolk's terror in Mongo's introduction scene in Blazing Saddles: "Never mind that shit...here comes Mongo!" and "If you shoot him, you'll just make him mad." It's pretty hard for me to take him seriously as an instrument of terror...and the fact that the Mountain 3.0 is so adorable does not help matters.
Â 


Â 
OMG!!Â  A Mongo reference.Â  I may not get through The Mountain's next scenes, inspite of the subject matter, without LMAO!!Â Â  Lady Fevre Dream like Mongo.Â
1709	Le Cygne	2014-05-21	Oh yeah, just remembered, Tyrion finally showed his colors about Winterfell.  Talking like he owns her and he owns that, too.  And Bronn called him on it.  Bronn, ever practical, called out that Tyrion doesn't actually have Sansa or Winterfell. She's gone, baby, gone.
Only took them a season to finally add that bit of greyness.
Also, remembered another line changed, Daario has been with a thousand women, but never a dragon.

Â 
Jaime did call her Beast, as you say, when they first met, and iirc, during the fight he complimented her but called her a great beast of a woman at the same time.Â  I'd been thinking about all of Jaime's beast references on the show since posting in this thread recently.Â  That could be D&D's shot at a replacement for wench, I suppose.Â  Part of me understands why they have changed the wording at times, but part of me wonders at all the added 'cunt'
throughout the show but the lack of 'wench.'Â 
Â 
After giving the Red Ronnet idea thought, I really do think we may have a shot at those type of scenes in the future.Â  They need to have Jaime do somethign on his riverland tour and I doubt they've destroyed the Harrenhal and Bearbit sets.Â  That and all the setup for Jon Connington and Aegon leads me to believe........we might just get it.Â

Â 
I wonder if GRRM is a Blazing Saddles fan, because just as Mongo's fearsomeness is signaled by punching out a horse (still probably the funniest thing I've ever seen), the Mountain's fearsomeness is signaled by decapitating his.
Â 
Â 
Â 
And Bronn called him on it.
Â 
Well, no. Bronn only said "If and may and could," pointing out that there's a lot of hypothetical steps between the present and Bronn getting a piece of the North, which is true. Not to mention that Bronn, who cheerfully alluded to murdering his wife's sister to advance his own goals in that very same conversation, and who once urged Tyrion to marry Sansa because of the material benefits it would bring him while keeping Shae as a lover, is an interesting choice for a character whose dialogue you'd like to parse for subtext about not treating women like property. Nice try, though.

Yeah, so many wanted wench, it's not mean, and it's woman, which gets to her issues of acceptance,
The Red Ronnet scene, that would be so much more powerful if they cut from her to him.  They did some of these cuts from/to Sansa/Sandor this season, it's easier to tell a story visually when they are both around,  If Brienne sits out most of the season, that's not there.

I was going to get into the big differences on the word 'cunt' from an American to European perspective on the last post, but decided not to do so.Â  (This laptop is slowing me down, I need the big computer to thread jump and post more quickly, LOL).Â  Anyway, this came up on the book forum side,and there is a big difference in how the 'c' word is viewed on each side of the pond.Â  It seems in Europe, maybe the UK specifically, that the word is used against men alot as a way to call them wussies or something.Â  Over here in the US...it's mostly a derrogatory word used against women, and it gets a much different reaction.Â  Being as D&D are American......I highly suspect it's a conscious choice, they wanted the more inflammatory 'c' word just for shock value over here, part of me really thinks that.Â  In choosing to use 'cunt' so much, I think they decided that 'wench' was out, being too cutesy.Â  The reason they didn't have Jaime use the word on Brienne, they know that would basically rule out any respect between him and Brienne on this side of the pond.Â  JMO, I don't think it's the entire reason, but I think there is something to my above observations.Â

I was thinking we might be on the same side of the pond.Â  (Now I'm hearing Caddyshack in my head, pool or pond, pond would be good for you-Bill Murray, that is).Â  I more so meant that they use cunt in general for the shock value over here, not that they should have used it with Brienne and Jaime.Â  But, all the times I have to hear the word cunt, and very rarely find it funny or appropriate, I basically call BS on their nonusage of wench.Â

They are so afraid of taking chances with these little silly things people say that bring them closer...   Before you know it, they end up with this bland thing, littered with cunt this and cunt that...  Thank goodness they didn't think it too cutesy for a big badassed warrior to call someone who was kind to him little bird.

As for "wench," I will never, ever blame the writers for trying to tone down the camp. The source material is campy enough as it is. If the price of those efforts to veer away from camp is that the series is closer to "bland" than to Hercules The Legendary Journeys, so be it.

1723	WastingSickness	2014-05-21	I'm not sure what was going on with the background in Sansa's Eyrie scene. The entrances into the courtyard were covered in gridlines. Did the visual effects budget run out so the surfaces lacked texture? Or was that supposed to represent actual metal structures - a lattice, portcullis etc.?
1724	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-21	I don't consider 'wench' campy, and while I'm not up in arms over it not being used........I think a little humor, and even camp, is part of life.Â  What I like about the books is that they are really filled with three dimensional characters that show us drama and humor both.Â  Now, GRRM could use some help with writing sex scenes, but he's pretty good at the feelings inside people's heads when it comes to love, so for that I do have to give him credit for romance, too.Â  The distance between camp and humor and cuteness is in the eye of the beholder and this story leaves us needing a little cuteness now and then.Â  JMO

Agree. That looked very fake. Along with her super redder hair.
1726	Newstar	2014-05-21	I sometimes wonder if TV Sansa's hair colour is, er, digitally enhanced in certain scenes. It doesn't look nearly as red in RL as it did in the snow garden scene.
1727	Lord Damian	2014-05-21	Â 
Pretty sure that was proven to be a false rumor. And didn't Emilia Clarke go nude on broadway not too long ago?


racous sex scenes she has a problem with, nudity no so much but she is going to be expensive for future season, her star is rising. especially after landing the role of sarah connor in the new Terminator rebut based on an alternative future.
1728	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-21	I usually don't nitpick much but there were some serious issues with this episode. Thank goodness for Peter Dinklage, Pedro Pascal, Jerome Flynn and the Eyrie storyline for saving it from being a complete ho-hum episode.
Â 
The Melissandre scene - just Ugg. Pointless and I'm tired of seeing her boobs.
Â 
But I'm getting more and more offended at the handling of Dany's storyline and for the first time I'm starting to wonder if it is Emilia Clarke's acting. Something is just so wrong with the characterization of Dany and also this new Daario is boring as watching paint dry and he's not sexy. I felt bad for him when he took his clothes off. Â Just what in the world are they doing? Dany is fast becoming a one note caricature. Not good at all. They have taken away her complexity or Emilia Clarke is completely unable to convey it or both. Also, she and Daario have zip nada on the chemistry front, which is I'm guessing why there were no love-making scenes. Even if EC doesn't want to be nude, they could do a love scene. I'm guessing that they shot one and cut it b/c the chemistry is so awful. She has more chemistry Jorah, Grey Worm and Barristan and now they've casted a rather good-looking Hizdahr and we're supposed to believe that Dany's more into this Daario. Girl, bye! No Â 
Â 
Other nitpicks: the Mountain - just no
Arya's really sad supposedly badass line - just no
Sansa still having red hair and Brienne openly asking for Sansa - I think audibly groaned when she did that one.
WTF with Jon and the tunnels?!?!

But the show is still ADDING more camp: the Spice King, the over-sexualisation of the Dornish, the portrayal of Loras, the whole Pod/prostitutes throwaway "joke" last season...
Â 
"Wench" might be "camp", but it was positively received by book readers, which is generally a good indication that it would have worked with show watchers. And considering they opted for a comedy angle during the early Jaime/Brienne scenes, I think it's fair to assume that the "Wench", "Kingslayer" back-and-forth would have worked.
1731	Newstar	2014-05-21	No, it really wouldn't have. Something "working" in the books doesn't mean it will work on screen, and that principle has guided a lot of the visuals and the writing in the adaptation: no blue pronged beards, for one, no Sandor pinning Sansa down on her bed at knifepoint for another. Fans don't seem to grasp the difference between the effect of reading something in the books and viewing or hearing something on TV, but there's a big difference. One does not equal the other. It is true that the writers aren't immune from campy tendencies, either, as much as they tone down a lot of ASOIAF silliness, and it can be very silly (Dany's arc is probably the worst offender in the camp department), but I appreciate all of their efforts to minimize it in the source material they use. If that means "wench" gets the boot because Medieval Times and ren fairs have ruined it forever, then so be it.

Yes, and it's classic Hollywood sparring, the back and forth, the author knows his stuff and writes good dialogue, he's got a really good sense of rhythm and timing.

Jon Snow arguing for the gate tunnels through the Wall to be sealed?Â  He will argue tooth and nail for the opposite in the books.Â  Also, the argument between them seemed much more about Allister Throne being mean than being right.Â  Did not like.
Â 


Â 
Yep, seemed like a total flip on Jon's character and made him look like the biggest fool. Jon's story has really grinded me all season tbh. I really thought Kit was going to steal this season, I was expecting some really great scenes to show the audience Jon has that ability to become LC.

Â 
So, I can't listen to Oberyn without hearing Inigo Montoya. I'm right there with you. I won't be able to sit through the fight without hearing 'Hello, my name is Prince Oberyn. And you killed my sister. Prepare to die.'
Â 
Steven King uses Castle Rock as an homage to the book, Lord of the Flies. So maybe Casterly Rock is actually nod to that.

Other than that the only things I didn't really like were Mels scene and D any/Daario but they both were okay.

You all missed the point. http://io9.com/just-...68098/ mxyzptlk
1741	JonInVa	2014-05-21	My only nitpick is how Biter and Rorge were miraculously able to sneak up on a seasoned warrior, with Arya facing the Hound (and able to see what's coming). 
In addition, since they know the Hound and how dangerous he is, and considering their super stealth abilities (sarc), they could just as easily put a sword or dagger through his neck. 
But no, we get quiet as a church mouse Biter leaping on a fully armored man's back, and his comrade just standing there - even after Biter was lying in the dirt dead. And then monologues with the man he supposedly is risking his life to kill. 
Seemed like total filler and a poor way to give the Hound his wound. Lazy writing, in my opinion. Even so, always enjoy Hound/Arya scenes even when the scenes are nonsensical.

1742	Old Rusty Coin	2014-05-21	Arya needs to know Rorge's name before she can exact her personal vengeance.Â  I wonder if the show will do something with that when she's doing the Faceless thing in Braavos.

1743	Fantasy Character	2014-05-22	Since when does not knowing someone's name prevent someone from being on Arya's list? She lists "The Red Woman", right?
1744	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-22	Since when does not knowing someone's name prevent someone from being on Arya's list? She lists "The Red Woman", right?


Â 
Melisandre is known as "The Red Woman". She doesn't say "Sandor Clegane" either. I think that's enough, instead of "creepy guy I knew about a year before".
1745	Fantasy Character	2014-05-22	I think "Threatening Stick Guy" would have done.
1746	Rouse Me Not	2014-05-22	I hate the way most of Essos is normally portrayed on the show nowadays. And to be honest, I really don't by all the "It wouldn't look cool" arguments in regards to appearances for the Tyroshi, Ghiscari, etc. Did people complain about shows like John Adams because of the Wigs and attire? Did they not take it seriously? Should the makers have tried to make it less "silly", and more "marketable"? HELL NO! It looked fine, and no one gave a shit because it was true to the place and period. Beyond that, there are loads of Historical, Fantasy, and Sci-Fi movies/television out there that are popular and have plenty of sets and characters that are unusual and far out in appearance. For God's sake, look at The Hunger Games film series. It's one of the most popular, top-selling, blockbusters out there right now. There are characters and designs in that series that are far more bizarre or outlandish than ANYTHING in asoiaf.
Maybe they could at least TRY to emulate Martin's descriptions, and if it doesn't work or looks "silly", they can just go back to putting everyone in a robe, and giving them the same generic accent(or none at all).
Apart from the stupidity of it, what's also problematic about the "toning down" of characters from the east is that it gives this notion that all of the cultures and people outside Westeros are all just kind of the same. One homogeneous group. What's to distinguish aÂ Braavosi from a Tyroshi, or an Ibbenese from a Ghiscari. I'ts dull, It's insulting, and it's pointless. They didn't do this with the Dothraki back in S1.
1747	Le Cygne	2014-05-22	You all missed the point.http://io9.com/just-...68098/ mxyzptlk


Â 
Yeah, can't fault them for a Waiting for Godot reference.Â  Didn't have a problem with that one.
1748	PatrickStormborn	2014-05-22	No, it really wouldn't have. Something "working" in the books doesn't mean it will work on screen, and that principle has guided a lot of the visuals and the writing in the adaptation: no blue pronged beards, for one, no Sandor pinning Sansa down on her bed at knifepoint for another. Fans don't seem to grasp the difference between the effect of reading something in the books and viewing or hearing something on TV, but there's a big difference. One does not equal the other. It is true that the writers aren't immune from campy tendencies, either, as much as they tone down a lot of ASOIAF silliness, and it can be very silly (Dany's arc is probably the worst offender in the camp department), but I appreciate all of their efforts to minimize it in the source material they use. If that means "wench" gets the boot because Medieval Times and ren fairs have ruined it forever, then so be it.


Â 
GRRM is using the word "wench" with the knowledge of what modern-day implications it has for readers, so your point honestly means very little. It's supposed to be funny. It's supposed to make us roll our eyes. It's important that Jaime insults her without using a word that has power against women today (which would be lost if he called her either of the words you previously suggested). Book readers live in the same world as show watchers, so generally the words used have the same effect on both of us.
Â 
You're right that some stylistic choices might not work on screen (although personally I disagree with your examples; I think a "toned-down" blue-pronged beard would work in the same way that Jaqen's hair worked, and I think a more faithful to the book Sandor/Sansa would have been far more interesting to watch). But book dialogue has always been received positively when used, even if it is camp. And I really don't understand what your problem is with it. Jaime and Brienne's journey through the Riverlands is supposed to be a bit camp (and indeed, it still remains camp in the show); their silly "Wench"-"Kingslayer" back-and-forth is supposed to be comedic, and it acts as an interesting juxtaposition against the horrors of war that they face. It's also important to the theme of identity which is so crucial to ASOIAF: Jaime feels like the Kingslayer and Brienne feels relatively powerless despite her physical power, so the fact that they each insist on being called by their names, and eventually come to respect each other and see each other as Jaime and Brienne rather than the Kingslayer and the wench, is so important. And in a show where there isn't much ability to convey the feelings of the characters, the external manifestation of this identity crisis through dialogue is just perfect.
Â 
But it was lost, and you think it was a good thing because viewers might be like "LOL the word wench is funny"??
1749	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-22	Yeah they should have kept Wench in tbh. I'm not sure why they didn't. 
And I hate nitpicking, but they should have Kept Only Cat. I watched again last night. My brain goes "Only Cat" but my ears done hear it. Shame. This is only a point to book readers though. If you are show only, it makes no difference. 
Dialogue should be more book based. It was jarring when LF said "my poor silly jelous wife" because he doesn't speak like that in the show. 
I understand the reasons for making the dialogue more "modern" and it did give us the Fooking legend of Gin Alley tbf. 
The use of cunt is silly. In the UK it's not as likely to offend as in the USA. It has different connotations over hear. I liked hearing the Hound say it. It fits with his character in the show. 
I honestly prefer "Bugger you, bugger him and bugger the king" to "fuck the king" but both have the same meaning.
1750	Newstar	2014-05-22	Yes, PatrickStormborn but GRRM can be awfully tone-deaf, and, as I said, what works on the page in the sense of not being wholly campy, silly or ridiculous can sound or look dumb on screen...which, weirdly, seems to be a concept a lot of ASOIAF fans angry about certain book/TV changes struggle with. One-breasted Qartheen gowns, anyone? "Wench" was silly enough in the books, but its silliness is compounded by actors in a live-action adaptation using the word. Just because something was accepted--or at least tolerated--by some book readers as workable in the books does not mean that TV viewers would have the same reaction.
Â 
WIth reference to "wench," that famous quote from Harrison Ford in reference to complaining about another George's dialogue applies: "You can write this shit, George, but you can't say it."
Â 
Your point that book dialogue in the show has always been received positively when used, even if verifiable (which it isn't), is not true, as any perusal of the comments of Unsullied fans or the reviews of Unsullied critics who don't know the difference between non-book and book dialogue would reveal. You might be surprised at their bracing lack of reverence towards book dialogue. It might be true among the most fanatical, diehard, purist book fans who can admit no error of GRRM, who always uncritically prefer GRRM dialogue to whatever the TV writers throw at them no matter what it is if only because it was GRRM wrote it, but the TV viewership is not made up entirely of extremely fanatical, diehard, purist book fans, or even entirely of people who've read the books. I'm not talking about purist book fans, here, as you well know. I suspect "wench" was not omitted with purist book fans in mind, neither for their benefit nor to spite them, any more than "maid" was swapped out for "virgin" with book fans in mind when Lysa was interrogating Sansa in the show.
Â 
I'd also add, having spent enough time on these boards and other ASOIAF fan communities to know, that there are plenty of extremely fanatical, diehard, purist book fans who take issue with ASOIAF dialogue with reference to specific lines being campy, cheesy, dumb, cornball, overwrought, overblown, pretentious, eyeroll-inducing, reflective of misogyny, reflective of a lack of understanding of women, etc. etc.--not to mention those who despite their otherwise all-consuming love for the books find themselves infuriated by GRRM's repetitive use of "catchphrases" and medieval speak of dubious accuracy--and did so long before the show ever went to air, which sort of puts the lie to your claim that book dialogue is always received positively.
Â 
I've explained why "wench" wouldn't work for the adaptation, a few times in fact: it's incredibly campy in a show where the writers have deliberately tried to tone down the camp in the source material, it's associated in modern times with Medieval Times and ren faires, and just because something works on the page doesn't mean it will work on screen. Your argument seems to boil down to "I think it would have worked in the show because I think it's super great in the books," which is fine but is no argument, and "I think it would have worked in the show because everyone always loves it when book dialogue is used," which is not even true and would not be verifiable even if true.
Â 
As for your claim that a "toned-down" blue-pronged beard would have worked as Jaqen's hair worked, there's just no way. Neither Michiel Huisman nor Ed Skrein is hot enough to pull that off without looking like an idiot. I don't think there's any man alive that's hot enough to pull that off. Not even Johnny Depp could have made Jack Sparrow's beard braids work if his hair had been blue. If you're sufficiently gorgeous and charismatic, you can pull off a normal hairstyle with a goofy colour (Jaqen), or you can pull off a goofy hairstyle with a normal hair colour (Drogo, Oberyn). Can't have it both ways.
Â 
When it comes to Sandor/Sansa's bedroom assault, you can go right on thinking that "it would have been more interesting," but that doesn't mean the decision to leave it out wasn't the right one. On the page, it's one thing. On the screen, Moral Event Horizon for Sandor. Interestingly, the show includes an attempted gang rape which, had the Sandor assault been left in, would have further highlighted the awfulness of his act. In the books, it never got as far as Sansa pinned on the ground, but it's made pretty clear that she would have been raped as well had the Hound not intervened. Instead, TV Sandor chides Arya about there being men out there who "want to rape little girls," referring specifically to the attempted rape of Sansa in the show, which is especially rich in light of Book Sandor pinning Sansa on her bed at knifepoint and later admitting to Arya that he meant to rape ("take," but in context it clearly refers to rape) her. There's also that scene in 4x01 where in the TV version the goons are shown to be rapists and child molesters, no doubt to differentiate them from TV Sandor, who while also a killer and a thug is shown to be disgusted by their behaviour (because he of course would never contemplate such a thing). It's not particularly subtle, of course--very few things on the show are--but it's a change that makes a lot of sense, especially since the writers seem to view committing or attempting rape as the defining quality of worthless scum whose deaths we cheer on in the show (the rioters Sandor kills, the mutineers killed at Craster's Keep, the Lannister soldiers at the inn, the Stark soldiers Brienne kills, etc. etc.). I think part of the reason the attempted gang rape on Sansa went as far as it did is so that the audience would cheer on the deaths of the rioters, as opposed to feeling conflicted about Sandor killing them. If they had just been jostling Sansa around a little or trying to pull on her arm, Sandor coming in and killing all of them wouldn't have had the same "Hell, yeah!" flavour, as it wouldn't be visually clear that they were scum who needed to die (you could still infer that they intended to rape Sansa, but it wouldn't be as viscerally clear as it was with Sansa being held down while one of them fumbled with his pants). If rape's your main tool to differentiate between scum and non-scum, then you're going to want to avoid showing your non-scum character pinning a female child character he's in love with on a bed at knifepoint--because that visual speaks for itself--and scrub any whiff of it from a character you want to be viewed as non-scum (which is why the Jaime/Cersei fiasco in 4x03 mystified me, but that's another matter). So TV Sandor only ever lays a hand on Sansa to prevent her from shoving Joffrey and to rescue her from the riot (where he implicitly requests her consent by holding out his hand to help her to stand), and keeps a respectful distance from her and her bed at all times during the bedroom scene except to get in her face a little at the end of it (without touching her). Makes sense.
Â 
Since this is the "Nitpick WITH impunity," thread, though, I will bitch about Sansa still wearing her very Lannister ring. I'm not even sure if it's supposed to be a wedding ring or not, since wedding rings are not a thing in Westeros, but at any rate that ring screams "Lannister" (tacky, huge, gold and red colours), and I don't understand why Sansa hasn't ditched it, since 1) she hates the Lannisters, 2) her time in KL was traumatizing and I doubt she would want to have a constant reminder of it every time she looked at her hand, and 3) she's in hiding supposedly concealing her identity, and the ring is a big honking clue as to that identity.

I have to give congrats to you on the name, Cart Guy.Â  Lots about that scene were great, other than the 'nothing' being nothing worthwhile.
Â 
The entire Biter and Rorge appearance is a giant nit, I'm not even sure there was a point to their appearance.Â  What a waste of wonderfully horrible characters.Â  I remember in the books, paraphrasing, at Arya wondering if Rorge and Biter were demons that Jaqen had summoned up from hell.Â  The more their story progressed, minus Arya around to see it, the more I did wonder if at least the part about them being demons could be true.Â  It's amazing that D&D managed to make them, well..........nothing.Â

Steven King uses Castle Rock as an homage to the book, Lord of the Flies. So maybe Casterly Rock is actually nod to that.

1758	Le Cygne	2014-05-22	Agree with PatrickStormborn about language. The word wench is fine, and means young peasant woman, and if there are sexual connotations, as in a lusty tavern wench, so much the better. That's how GRRM was using it, too. Jaime was teasing her.Also agree about Sansa and Sandor, the night of the fire, the show conveyed the subtext, he was there to protect her, and that's what he regretted when he was "dying," because he didn't take her with him, bad things happened to her (= also the official app states).Also, I found this, Jaime:Â A big strong peasant wench to look at her, yet she speaks like one highborn and wears longsword and dagger. Ah, but can she use them?

Â 
I did like The Hound telling his story about how he was playing with Gregor's toy, but I really missed the line, There was no joy in it, I tell you...........something to that effect iirc from the original book dialogue from Sandor to Sansa.Â  I always thought that was a nice touch, Sandor just seemed to KNOW that he'd pay dearly for touching the toy that Gregor didn't even care about anyway.Â  You could feel Sandor's childhood tension in those original lines shared with Sansa.Â  I did miss those lines and yeah, it's a nitpick.Â  I think Rory could have delivered that line and the feeling behind it.

I think I did read that as the reasoning, too.Â  Regarldess of that, I was hoping that the above mentioned line, about not getting any joy from it, would be included when he told the story to Arya.Â  It makes clear that Sandor already knew his brother was a nasty piece of work.Â

That he wanted to imagine being a knight so much, he'd risk Gergor's ire. And then they turned around and knighted Gregor, that's why he's no ser.

Â 
Yup, and the show has managed to spread the whole story over two unconnected seasons, not to mention......not doing something to connect it all with the knight vs no true knight connotations.Â  That'd be bigger than a nitpick, though, LOL, I guess?Â 
Â 
I am just kinda surprised, as the show does seem very taken with Rory and The Hound both, that they didn't do something to drive more of the points home.Â  I'm not sure why but the taking no joy from it line really spoke to me...........so I was hopeful for it.Â

At the time of their trip the rightful ruler of Dorne was Oberyn's mother and coupled with the first episode where they changed a number of ruling Dornish Ladies to Lords, I hope they aren't chnaging the laws of Dornish Succession. Mostly I just don't understand the need to change this.

1772	Whipsy	2014-05-22	Emelia Clarke and her agent put their perverbial foot down to HBO and the show producers last year, no more raunchy scenes for Dany. That is probably why the original Daario got pissed off and quit so that they had to get this guy to replace him. HA Ha HA
I don't know if this has been mentioned in later pages but I do not believe this is actually true. Oona Chaplin mentioned that one of the actresses that got naked often in season 1 refused to do it anymore. A lot of people speculated that it was Clarke but it was only speculation and last year Emilia was in Breakfast at Tiffany's on Broadway where she did a full frontal nude scene every night for several months so I don't think she has a problem with the nudity. I don't know why there wasn't a sex scene, it's frustrating and bizarre.
I'm not sure which actress said she wouldn't get naked anymore but I think it was the one who played Ros.
My nitpick: Lysa should have been soundless as she plummeted to her death. Completely shocked and crushed.

She learns that Arya is possibly still out there somewhere in FFC too, just from someone else. We don't know if or how that will play into the plot of the books either just yet.
1777	7th-key	2014-05-22	Even if the actress wouldn't want to do nudity, why should that be an impediment to a sex scene? Let the guy be full naked and the woman fully dressed for a change.
Â 
Anyway, as someone mentioned above or in another thread, the solution to gratuitous female nudity is not gratuitous male nudity; it's simply portraying nudity where it feels natural.

1779	7th-key	2014-05-23	Hot Pie was still fixed on Armour = Knight andÂ  "Winterhell", though he was told differently by Gendry and Arya, It was to give the audience a quick trip down memory lane, but I guess Hot Pie doesn't learn anything that is not cooking related. Given the improvement in details and quick availability, he must have been incorporating wolf bread in his regular production.
Also, Brienne better find Arya quickly before that loaf gets mouldy.
What? It's the nitpicking thread!
Â 
Talking about memory lane, I would have preferred Sansa lingering more on snow Winterfell. Because it was a moment about her reconnecting with her inner Stark - considering that she's been fully immersed in KL's lifestyle even before she left home in S1.
Missing the slow build of the snow castle made also seem the escalation to the slap quick. Sansa reaction seemed immature. Though lot of people cheered. I remember Book!Robin as fragile and unstable, while TV!Robin, seems just abnormally spoiled.

1781	Krutoon	2014-05-23	My major complaint was how the conversation between the Hound, Arya, and the old dying guy seemed to drag on and on and only sort of got to the point (the "gift of mercy" point.) Then again, their scenes have been boring me in general this season.
Â 
Also, Sansa being like "YOU RUINED IT" when Robin knocked over the tower. I know it was supposed to represent her ideal Winterfell and all that so she'd be emotional about it, but I thought her reaction was overly immature. Like, girl, just fix the tower. It would only take a minute. But instead they're screaming and gettin' slapped. For me it reversed some of her personal growth this season.

Â 
they seem to be maturing Sansa much faster in the show than in the books...i remember her being a completely idiotic immature head-up-her-ass kid in the books the whole time...so seeing her looking through LF's bullshit so quick was actually kinda weird for me...this seemed more in character imo....other than the slap...book!sansa would throw a hissy fit and run away in tearsÂ

Â 
I was slightly bothered by Sansa's "You ruined it" - not so much her words, but their delivery, short and exasperated at the naughty child, not the words of a girl who spent a good hour reconstructing her lost home as a snow castle and thinking of her lost family and lost innocence as well. Â I would have expected a little more depth of emotion in TV-Sansa at that point. Â 
Â 
I actually liked the Hound/Arya scene; especially when Sandor schooled Arya on "mercy". Â We saw Sandor as a human being, not just the snarling macho dog, and the establishment of a slight connection between him and Arya. Â I thought McCann did some decent acting. Â

What evidence do you have for this?
My unsullied mates all know who Elia is and why Oberyn wants revenge. 
Unsullied are normal people like me and you. They aren't utterly brain dead knuckle dragging morons. 
The amount of times Elia has been mentioned this season is actually insane.
1790	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-24	After watching the episode AGAINA only actual complaint is "Your sister". 
I guess it doesn't matter but come on, "only cat".
1791	Zorn Gottes	2014-05-24	I thought the Sandor/Sansa confessional scene was cut because of production difficulties...something about rain, I thought.

Rory McCann has another version... I linked it weeks ago in the SanSan thread in "General GOT", he says:My audition was a scene of the Hound describing to Sansa how he got his burned face. It happens in the book, and they were gonna film it in the first episode: "Look at me â<U+0080><U+0094> this is the reason I am the way I am." Then they decided not to do it. David pushed Dan into my trailer, and I was like, "Why are you pushing the wee guy in? You got something to say?" "We decided we want to bring you in gentler. We don't want you to talk about yourself at the moment. But don't worry!" I go "You're bruising my ego. You're not...firing me?" "No, no, we're not firing you! We're just gonna bring you in slower." It's taken four fucking years, but here we go. [Laughs] That's what's happening. I'm gonna open up this time. The Hound's gonna speak freely.

1792	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-24	^ That doesn't preclude the fact that they ran into production difficulties on the day that they were going to film his sequence during the tournament. So it's not a "different version" of the story at all. David & Dan rightly decided that adding this information about The Hound into an already jam-packed pilot episode wasn't the best idea, and instead opted to introduce that element of his character later in the season. Due to production issues, they ended up not being able to film the sequence as they had originally planned, so they transferred the monologue to Littlefinger. Unfortunate, yes, but these things happen during filming.Â

It was not in the pilot episode as I recall. And it does make it a different version of the story if Littlefinger tells Sansa and not the Hound.

Â 
The original scene was supposed to be in the pilot as McCann is referencing above. It got shuttled into the Hand's Tournament episode but they had severe problems with the filming because of the weather and they had to condense a lot of stuff. The only way to get the story in was to have LF tell it to Sansa. That wasn't the original plan.

This is old news.
1796	Starkian	2014-05-24	Hello people.
Â 
First of all,i would like to ask a question.In the "positive nitpicking" thread there're clear rules that forbid someone from bashing other people's opinions and the thread is exactly as it's name suggests:a paradise of positivity.Why is it then,that in this thread called "nitpicking with impunity" anyone is free to bash other people's opinions with no consequences at all?I'm not talking about the people who express their opposition to certain opinions with well founded arguments (although, i also find them out of place in this particular thread).I'm reffering to people who make posts that are plain rude,sarcastic or even tread on trolling territory.Can't there be some rules at the start of this thread too?
Â 
Also,i would like to clarify that i'm not a "purist","elitist" or whatever term the "non-purists" are so fond of throwing around.I've read the books only once.I like the books (more) and i like the show.That's it.
Â 
On to the nitpicking:
The Mountain:Urgh...the mindless gore!A very clumsy way of re-establishing the Mountain as the big bad butcher.
Yes.Melisandre's boobs floating happily in the bathtub was nothing but gratuitous.
I don't much care for Dany's arc in general and most of her scenes leave me indifferent (and the actress,being of not exactly top quality,doesn't help in piquing my interest),but i totally agree with the nitpicks mentioned above.
Arya-Hound:Rorge and Biter going down so easily was pretty lame.My biggest nitpick is Arya's reaction,or rather non reaction,upon hearing of Joffrey's death.A brief glance exchanging with the Hound and that was it!Come on Arya!Joffrey was at the top of your death list and had been on your general hate list since season 1.Show a little emotion,do a happy dance,sing,give a tiny evil smile (she even did that for Rorge!).I don't Â know,i was pretty disappointed.I was looking forward to her reaction...(not that i blame the actress)
The Eyrie scenes were a little rushed,not enough built up.The slapping of Robbin (although a very small,mean part of me enjoyed it!) felt out of character,at least show-Sansa's character.The "only Cat" line change did't bother me personally,but i did find it unnecessarily stupid and stupidly unnecessary.I mean,a few moments ago LF was gushing to Sansa about how much he loved her mother blah,blah.Who else could Cat be?I don't think the show viewers are that dumb.

1797	Le Cygne	2014-05-24	Welcome.Â Nitpick threads are where you can criticize the show all you want, and no one (in theory) will tell you how wrong you are for not thinking the show is perfect.Â I think that's the only difference between this and typical threads.Â  Spoilers are permitted, except TWOW spoilers go in spoiler tags (except in the TWOW section).Â At this point I'm pretty confused about the whole show and just hoping to see some good scenes here and there... It's getting close to the end of the road for me.Â I'm willing to believe the Unsullied still have no idea who Elia was, who Rhaegar was and wtf happenedTheir only reason for caring about Oberyn is because he's gonna fight for Saint Tyrion, I guess.This. Having Meera tell Bran the story of the knight of the laughing tree would have been something nice to add to the season, something uplifting. I would have preferred that to the Craster's Keep fanfic, and I think they would have liked it, and it would have given some nice background, too.

1807	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-28	S3 E10 wasn't that long ago, was it? It seemed like an out of the blue "curtain call" when reading it too. I dunno if the character's death is such a huge deal, more so the ripple effect of the death,which still can be played out on a smaller scale next season. I suppose folks may be looking for a "sibling rivalry"/FM reveal (which still could come). But I think I remember reading and being like "oh shit....he died too...wow", I don't recall a lot of set up.

1811	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-29	The only Jaime/Brienne line I miss was when he jumped into the bear pit and
Â 
"Kingslayer!"
Â 
"Jaime."
Â 
The way it was done in the show wasn't bad, but that scene in the books was so much cooler. That was the moment where he ditched his old blind self and grew into something better.
1812	Le Cygne	2014-05-29	And of course, the REST of that was..."We're taking the wench.""Her name is Brienne," Jaime said.
1813	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-29	Your point being?
1814	jakmanuk	2014-06-01	Pretty sure i read in an interview emilia clarke, told hbo she refuses to do any more nude scenes. that she wants to be remembered for her acting bringing the character of dany alive. not just being known as that white hair girl who got naked a lot on the show.Â 
Â 
Â 


She'll be remembered as the shit actress in Game of Thrones
1815	OnlyOne	2014-06-08	I liked the Eyrie scene a lot. BUT, I couldn't help to notice that while there's a mild snow there, a few episodes back we were shown a snow-less North. Is that supposed to make sense?

It has to start snowing sometime doesn't it? I don't see your point.
1816	OnlyOne	2014-06-08	I love how people refer to the unsullied in such condesending "it would be nice for them" ways. 
They aren't brain dead. They just choose not to read te novels and obsess over them online.

My family, the unsullied, look to me to explain EVERYTHING. They can't keep track of the charecter names, houses and storylines...so no, they aren't brain dead, but it's evident to me that the show hasn't been a rich enough resource for them. Mostly, they like the show, but feel lost or dare I say 'drowning' in the huge number of charecters and overall plot.
1817	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-06-30	Â 
The Mountain only pawn in game of life.
Â 
I wonder if GRRM is a Blazing Saddles fan, because just as Mongo's fearsomeness is signaled by punching out a horse (still probably the funniest thing I've ever seen), the Mountain's fearsomeness is signaled by decapitating his.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Well, no. Bronn only said "If and may and could," pointing out that there's a lot of hypothetical steps between the present and Bronn getting a piece of the North, which is true. Not to mention that Bronn, who cheerfully alluded to murdering his wife's sister to advance his own goals in that very same conversation, and who once urged Tyrion to marry Sansa because of the material benefits it would bring him while keeping Shae as a lover, is an interesting choice for a character whose dialogue you'd like to parse for subtext about not treating women like property. Nice try, though.


Â 
LOL Blazing Saddles is on right now, and I couldn't help but remember how The Mongo like Mountain 3.0 came up in this thread.

1828	NOT A TARG I SWEAR	2014-05-18	All the Tyrion scenes with Jamie/Bronn/Oberon were pretty great.
Â 
The development/semi-understanding between Arya and the Hound was also pretty good. Their relationship started to get repetitive where one week they were getting along and then suddenly one would do something to make the other annoyed and it really seemed like largely a relationship of necessity. This week it seemed to grow some and there was more of an understanding between the two which was well done besides the kind of lame disposal of Rorge and the cheesy existential lines from Arya.

1831	Alayne Stone	2014-05-18	Oh, man:
Â 
- Tyrion had me on the verge of tears. Â 
- Brienne's face throughout the Hot Pie interlude. Â Also, the way she delivered the Sansa Stark bio. Â Reading the books, I heard Brienne's voice as slow-witted and deliberate. Â Show Brienne is so, so, so much better.
- The Hound's performance utterly charmed me. Â I'd never, even reading the books, considered how close to the edge he really is. Â It reminded me of watching a western or war movie: the reluctant hero, trapped by closing circumstances, running out of options.
- I could watch Petyr push Lysa out the Moon Door forever. Â In fact, I might. Â Everything about his delivery, including the, oh, so awkward Sansa kiss, was expertly performed.
- Sansa learned to slap brats from TyrionÂ 
- Also: Sansa's line after the freakout about trying to remember what Winterfell looked like. Â It broke my heart a little.

1848	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-05-18	Going with the nitpicking theme - you probably had to be watching in HD to notice this, but Bronn finally got the sigil he wanted in Episode 1. There were flaming arrows on his cloak, which I kind of figured would be the case to reflect how his role in the Blackwater changed from the books.Â
1849	Fat Trell	2014-05-18	Gregor. That's Gregor. Perfect.
Â 
Hotpie is back. The Baker that was Promised stole his scene.
Â 
The ether Daario dropped on Jorah. Heartless stuff.
Â 
I rather liked Daario in general this episode.
Â 
All of Tyrion's scenes. Specifically with Bronn and Oberyn. Imagine that, nearly verbatim adaptation makes a good scene. Surprising.
1850	Nictarion	2014-05-18	Some great performances in this episode, especially Pascal and McCann.
Â 
Also Emilia in that dress 
Â 
And Hot Pie!
1851	Merysa Serrett	2014-05-18	HOT PIIIIIIIEEE
Â 
I squee'd when I saw Hot Pie again. Aww, his doughy little face. That direwolf is going to be pretty moldy if/when Arya ever gets it.Â 
Â 
Oberyn is such a badass. I don't want to like him as much as I do. The showdown between him and the Mountain is going to kill me.Â
1852	TheGreenBell	2014-05-18	Loved the Bronn/Tyrion scene. Also the Oberyn/Tyrion scene.
1853	darndes	2014-05-18	Bronn/Tyrion - Excellent job on both actors, I loved this goodbye...Bronn actually looked like he wanted to hug Tyrion.
Â 
Oberyn/Tyrion - Any scene with either of these actors is guaranteed to be awesome, but they both knocked this one out of the park. Â Oberyn telling Tyrion he was not a monster was touching and this whole scene had me wanting to cry right along with Peter Dinklage. Â How ironic that it's an enemy of the Lannisters that finally validates Tyrion as a man and human being?
Â 
Sansa/Peter/Lysa - I loved that scene all around, and since Joff's death, we haven't seen a bratty kid get a well deserved bitch slapÂ   Â My hat's off to Sansa!
1854	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-05-18	Â 
Sansa/Peter/Lysa - I loved that scene all around, and since Joff's death, we haven't seen a bratty kid get a well deserved bitch slapÂ   Â My hat's off to Sansa!


Â 
I've always wondered why Lysa was so damn obsessive about her son when she never liked Jon Arryn very much.
1855	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-18	This could have easily been my favorite episode had they not fumbled the ball on the Snow Castle/Only Cat sequence. Â  Everything about this episode was perfection. All of Tyrion's scenes, The Hound and Arya (which, btw, Maisie was a beauty in this episode), Pod and Bri, and of course....HOT PIE!!!!!!!!! Fuck yeah!!  But ugh. That Snow Castle sequence. FML.
1856	Seneti	2014-05-18	Going with the nitpicking theme - you probably had to be watching in HD to notice this, but Bronn finally got the sigil he wanted in Episode 1. There were flaming arrows on his cloak, which I kind of figured would be the case to reflect how his role in the Blackwater changed from the books.Â 


Â 
I hadn't noticed that. Great catch!
Â 
As for my own thoughts, here's what I took note of as I watched (beware, long post is long):
Â 
- Jaime's face when Tyrion mentions falling in love with a whore - do I smell foreshadowing?
- Tyrion's face when realizing that Jaime won't fight for him
- loved the cut to Gregor slaughtering people
- "That's where the heart is" - foreshadowingÂ  Â 
- Is that Rorge?Â   Â (ten seconds later: That is Rorge!)
- "Is he on your little list?" - awesome dialogue followed by Arya epicness
- the look in Thorne's eyes when Jon mentions giants
- Bronn in fancy clothes = duck in peacock feathers
- Hoorah for D&D getting the Stokeworth family right
- "If I wanted wits, I'd marry you"Â  Â 
- Bronn denying trial by combat
- Meereen at night looks gorgeous!
- Nice dress, Dany!
- Dany mentioning the revenge killings
- beginning of the relationship between Dany and Daario
- fully naked Daario and half-naked Gregor in one episode Â  Â 
- hooray to Selyse sharing Stannis' sense of humor
- naked CariceÂ  Â 
- Melisandre explaining her potions
- show Selyse has character depth - she seems very conflicted about Melisandre seducing Stannis
- "harsh truth" in the flames right after talking about Shireen - sacrifice theory confirmed? This makes the "only one hell scene" even creepier.
- Jorah's convo with Daario and the ramping up of jealousy
- Hizdahr as ambassador - this cannot end well.
- That wound on the hounds neck looks nasty!
- Loved the Hound telling his story to Arya. Poor Sandor...Â  Â 
- "and a hot meal not cooked by you" - "couldn't agree more, mylady"Â  Â 
- Hot Pie!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Hot Pie clearly trying to avoid the Stark question
- Pod pointing out how dumb it is to ask for Sansa by name
- Hot Pie baking more direwolf bread (also, the fact that he's managed to improve the shape that much, implies that he's been baking them at least a dozen times... truly heartwarming)
- Brienne trusting Pod enough to follow his advice
- Brienne's quest is already infinitely more interesting than it was in the books, IMO.
- Oberyn seeing straight through Cersei's attempts at manipulating him was great.
- Thank you D&D for keeping Oberyns convo with Tyrion.
- "I will be your champion" - this was my reaction: http://www.youtube.c...h?v=Jpgy21r_dRE
- Winterfell theme when Sansa enters the snow covered courtyardÂ  Â 
- "The bad people, the scary people and the people you don't like" says a lot about Lysa's way of ruling...
- Sansa gaining an edge (would like throwing things out the moon door and slaps Robin)
- Robin flipping and destroying Winterfell
- "his mother should have, a long time ago" - Petyr, I love you!
- The kiss was every bit as creepy as it should have been.
- "Blue eyes staring at nothing" - Sansa suspects what's coming.
- Everybody's performance during the moon door scene was spectacular.
- "Only Cat" became "Your sister" - This is actually a nice save for casual watchers who remember characters better by action/association rather than by name.
1857	edgeroc	2014-05-18	Mellisandre is hottest woman in the show, there i said it.


Â 
I agree with you sir. She is in a movie with Clive Owen called "The Intruders", such an amazing actress.

					
					
							Edited by edgeroc, 18 May 2014 - 11:48 PM.
1858	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-19	I was totally ok with Mel not bothering to hide her shame during her chat with Selyse. The situation was actually kinda neat and Mel is literally bearing all to Selyse. It had a kind of artistic bent to it and metaphor that Mel is revealing a great deal to Selyse who has absolute faith in her. And Mel's weird stoic way of trying to reassure Selyse that as long as she serves R'hllor, shes saved and can be powerful too. Its almost touching.Â
1859	Newstar	2014-05-19	I thought moving Oberyn's Cersei anecdote from the KL arrival to the scene with an imprisoned Tyrion was inspired. What was in the books a nasty little story told to push Tyrion's buttons became in the show a recognition by Oberyn of Tyrion's humanity and a reminder that not everyone saw him as a monster and that Jaime had always loved him and tried to protect him. Great scene.
1860	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-19	Pedro Pascal IS Oberyn Martell. I got chills. Best scene of the season.
1861	Ser Redjed	2014-05-19	The duality of the brothers Cleagane. Â Where you have the "Mountain" scene, in which he is brutally slaying prisoners, Â then the following scene with the Hound and Arya, where they give wounded man a "mercy" kill.
Â 
Just some wonderful juxtaposition I felt.Â
1862	LordStoneheart	2014-05-19	Sexy time with Daario. Loved the dynamic between the two.
Â 
And the look on Jorah's face!!!!! I could hear a thousand fedoras crying and getting readyÂ to make friendzoned memes. Was hoping for a traitor reveal, but it ended up showing a good mormont between them (someone slap me.) Seriously, though. Dany's interaction with both of them was very well written, I thought.
Â 
Never thought I'd love to see Hot Pie. his baking skills are getting awesome and his annoying lingering to Brienne was so funny. Loved this ep.
1863	Nictarion	2014-05-19	Seriously, though. Dany's interaction with both of them was very well written, I thought.And acted imo. I really enjoyed the Dany scenes in this episode, especially her talk with Jorah.
1864	Cat Alayne	2014-05-19	When Tyrion's face was trembling as Oberyn was telling him about what Cersei was doing to him I think i died a bit.Â Pedro killed that scene too, probably the most emotional scene yet of the season.Â 
Â 
The return of Hot Pie, Baker of Bread, Bane of Balls, Bringer of Gravy was great. I swear they mention Catelyn Stark about 3 times an episode (Catelyn Stark is DEAD, I promised to return to her mother WHO IS DEAD!!!!!) where Robb Stark is hardly brought up. If anyone wasn't sure yet, Lady Stoneheart confirmed! Get Hype!
Â 
Every scene at the wall is making me so excited for episode 9, its going to be awesome to see what they are going to do with it. Hopefully it might even live up to Blackwater, which IMO is the best episode of the entire series, just awesome tv.Â 
Â 
I thought I was straight, then Carice Van Houten happened.Â  Â Really intruiging stuff about Shireen (please don't die).Â 
Â 
Sweetrobin's actor is doing a fine job oscillating between childlike innocence/ being the most irritating spoilt brat ever.Â
1865	Jorah the Explorer	2014-05-19	I'm glad that they limited the Daario subplot. Â What was pages of endless drivel in the book has been minimized to a mostly off-camera throwaway scene so that's good.
Â 
Loved all the scenes in Tyrion's cell. Â Oberyn's speech very moving, and lifted directly from the book from what I can remember.

					
					
							Edited by Jorah the Explorer, 19 May 2014 - 01:13 AM.
1866	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-05-19	Pedro Pascal makes me feel the same way Johnathan Banks made me feel with his role in Breaking Bad. Such powerful presence.
1867	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-19	I'm glad that they limited the Daario subplot. Â What was pages of endless drivel in the book has been minimized to a mostly off-camera throwaway scene so that's good.
Considering that Dany decided not to send him away, that isn't the end of the Daario subplot. Not by a long shot.
1868	Le Cygne	2014-05-19	I loved the Dany/Daario scene. Dany rocked. Daario rocked. It was perfect.
1869	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-19	I thought I was straight, then Carice Van Houten happened. Â  Â Really intruiging stuff about Shireen (please don't die).Â 


looool! Shes pretty smoldering.Â 
Â 
Hey look...someone made a thing.
1870	acejack	2014-05-19	I thought moving Oberyn's Cersei anecdote from the KL arrival to the scene with an imprisoned Tyrion was inspired. What was in the books a nasty little story told to push Tyrion's buttons became in the show a recognition by Oberyn of Tyrion's humanity and a reminder that not everyone saw him as a monster and that Jaime had always loved him and tried to protect him. Great scene.


Â 
Very true.
1871	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-19	I thought moving Oberyn's Cersei anecdote from the KL arrival to the scene with an imprisoned Tyrion was inspired. What was in the books a nasty little story told to push Tyrion's buttons became in the show a recognition by Oberyn of Tyrion's humanity and a reminder that not everyone saw him as a monster and that Jaime had always loved him and tried to protect him. Great scene.


Â 
Couldn't agree more, it worked on so many levels.
Â 
Every scene with Tyrion. His talk with Jaime was really touching, as was Bronn's (but in a bro sorta way, haha). And then...
Oberyn's monolgue. Holy shit. As Newstar said, it was such a brilliant idea to move it to that scene and twist it into a totally different vibe. Absolutely adored that scene, and Pedro Pascal has cemented himself as my favourite actor this season.
Hot Pie! I was so surprised at him popping up again, and I loved the throwbacks to "Winterhell", "only knights wear armour", and the direwolf bread.Â 
I really liked the change that Brienne just outright asked for Sansa Stark by name, then gave Pod that "told you so" look when Hot Pie told them about Arya.Â 
The Hound opening up to Arya. Fucking loved it, man. I know some people are annoyed that they're becoming too friendly, but I'm sorry, I really like where they're going with this. I don't know how they're going to end it this season, but their relationship has been one of the high points for me this season.
Arya adding Rorge to her list before killing him straight after. The Hound was all "shit, girl learns fast!".
Winterfell snow castle and Sansa slapping Robin.
Sansa's little smile at LF's "what do we do to those who hurt the ones we love?".
The moon door!
Dany in dat dress.
Mel in dat bath.
1872	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-19	An amazing episode overall, and many of my "positive nitpicks" have already been mentioned, but I'd add a special shout-out for Selyse (the character and the actress). She never really registered with me in the books, but the scene between her and Melisandre was fantastic.It humanized the two of them in a way that the books never did, for me personally.Â
1873	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-05-19	Two brilliant speeches from unlikely places:
Â 
Â 


I thought moving Oberyn's Cersei anecdote from the KL arrival to the scene with an imprisoned Tyrion was inspired. What was in the books a nasty little story told to push Tyrion's buttons became in the show a recognition by Oberyn of Tyrion's humanity and a reminder that not everyone saw him as a monster and that Jaime had always loved him and tried to protect him. Great scene.


Â 
Yeah, that speech and Tyrion's reaction was amazing. Â Just beautifully written and acted.
Â 
And The Hound opening up to lil Arya.
Hearing this grizzled killer grumble like a hurt child, "I didn't steal his toy. Â I was only playing with it" actually made me almost tear up for the Hound.
1874	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-19	I also really liked Dany's scenes this week, particularly when she told Jorah that he was the who changed her mind. It offered a bit more humanity for Dany, and a winning moment for Jorah!
1875	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-05-19	I'm sure Jorah would rather have won the night before if you catch my drift.
1876	Frey Pies	2014-05-19	I agree with everything that has been posted above. I'd also like to commend D&D's writing today, which I thought was particularly brilliant.
1877	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-19	I thought all of Tyrion's dungeon interactions were good. The Oberyn one was the best.
Â 
"That's where the heart is" was a good re-staging.
Â 
The Hound explaining his face = important thing to get out there. Glad they did it.
Â 
Melisandre naked? No complaints here ! CVH's hotness is a blessing from RHillor.Â Â  
Â 
Also, again with Hot Pie and armour...Â  

					
					
							Edited by Pod The Impaler, 19 May 2014 - 02:57 AM.
1878	Queen of Whores	2014-05-19	- Bronn marrying Lollys and the mentions of Stokeworth and Falyse. I totally did not see the show including that stuff, but I'm glad they did. That whole scene was great overall, too.
- Hot Pie's cameo was funny and surprising.Â 
- Dany looked fantastic in that gown while talking to Jorah.
- Tyrion and Oberyn's dungeon scene was fantastic, and probably my favourite scene of this season so far. I'm so happy they kept the Casterly Rock story in the show.
- Oberyn's delivery of the line, "I've come to the perfect place," was completely epic.
- Sansa pimp-slapping Robin. Damn, how many times I wished she'd just do that in the books. I don't feel bad for admitting I take a bit of satisfaction at that.
- Melisandre.... that's all that needs to be saidÂ
1879	Zorn Gottes	2014-05-19	"You're learning", plus Arya cleaning her sword on Rorge's clothes, just like she saw Sandor doing 5 minutes before.

					
					
							Edited by Zorn Gottes, 19 May 2014 - 06:06 AM.
1880	SerMixalot	2014-05-19	Like Brienne I was initially annoyed at Hot Pie's discertation on gravy, but someone on the forum pointed out that it is apropos for ASOIAF given GRRM's descriptions of meals, so turned to happiness!
1881	TheCaptainSargey	2014-05-19	I have to agree. Hot Pie and the Melisandre scenes. 
Also that we got to see more of the NW officers, shame they weren't as easily identifiable.

					
					
							Edited by TheCaptainSargey, 19 May 2014 - 07:09 AM.
1882	aussiegirl	2014-05-19	Really enjoyed
Â 
Tyrion and all his talks
Bronn would totally marry Tyrion if he was female!
Mel in the bath - woman is gorgeous
Non reaction to Joffrey's death from Arya and the Hound - that was hilarious.
Arya's nothing speech - I didn't like it in the trailer but in the context of the episode it made sense.
The Hound trying to be angry with Arya but not really pulling it off.
The Mountain has apparently been hanging in Europe instead of the Riverlands!
Sweet Robin being sweet for about 20 seconds
Sansa slapping Sweet Robin
Didn't mind 'your sister'. Makes sense to the casual viewers.
Arya adding Rorge to the list and then killing him. That girl moved quick.
HOTPIE
Brienne, Pod and Hotpie - was anyone else waiting for Hotpie to turn to Pod and say 'Hey Gendry, where have you been?'
Â 
Absolutely best
Â 
Arya saying her own name. Seriously, how many people said her name this episode. Quite a few.
1883	Winter.Is.Coming	2014-05-19	I thought the scene between Oberyn and Tyrion was spectacular, great acting there. Also I loved Melisandre in this episode....damn that body! I have to admit that Robin getting slapped did raise my spirits slightly as well, plus Arya stabbing Rorge with expert precision.
1884	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-19	The Stark theme playingÂ as Sansa was building the Snow Winterfell. It really hit a nerve. Â Â 
Â 
It fits House Stark so well- sorrow, yet underlying endurance and hope.Â By far one of the most fitting themes I have heard for a specific character/scene/family etc.
Â 
Hot Pie!
Â 
Cersei is clearlyÂ an evil bitch once again.
1885	Raffles	2014-05-19	Tyrion and Bronn - brought a tear to my eye. Yes, Bronn was letting Tyrion down, but at least he was honest about it and said it to his face. The respect they had for each other from the beginning was there at the bitter end.
Â 
Sansa - how elegant and ladylike she looked.. her smile was beautiful when speaking to Robin. Then *pow*, right on the kisser.. she's getting her own back on the nasty world from now on, methinks!
Â 
Arya - another cold-blooded slaying.. how many is that now?
Â 
Ser Jorah - my, how he grew to 10 feet tall at Dany's "No... tell him YOU changed my mind." comment 
Â 
Hot Pie - a nice unexpected appearance, complete with Dire Wolf bread for Arya.
Â 
Petyr - not as creepy as the ship scene, even when he stood close to, then kissed, Sansa. The kiss was well done, I thought.Â  Kissing a (then) 17 y/o Sophie Turner is a good thing
1886	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-19	Cersei is clearlyÂ an evil bitch once again.


Â 
I loved how she so elegantly stepped over that peasant's guts.
1887	Brother Walfrid	2014-05-19	I really liked Sansa saying she'd like Robin to throw people out the moon door on her behalf. You could see it dawning on her that she might soon have the power to exact revenge on those who wrong her. Also loved the smile she gave when LF hinted that his motive was vengeance for Catelyns death.
She's going to be a cold hearted kllling machine.
1888	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-05-19	that scene with tyrion and oberyn in the dungeons was awesome
1889	Indigocell	2014-05-19	- Sansa imp-slapping Robin. Damn, how many times I wished she'd just do that in the books. I don't feel bad for admitting I take a bit of satisfaction at that.


Â 
Fixed that for you.
Â 
She's seen Tyrion do it once or twice.
1890	RhaenysBalerion	2014-05-19	-Bronn and Tyrion goodbye
- Cersei stepping over the bloody entrails and greeting The Mountain. Herself again.
- Sansa's snow Winterfell and the scene with Robin
- Daario telling Ser Jorah Daenerys is in a good mood (I was laughing SO hard, poor Jorah)
- OberynÂ 
- Hot Pie being Hot Pie and making a new wolfpie for AryaÂ 
Â 
And that's about it.Â
1891	Fat Mac	2014-05-19	-Lysa popping up in the background of the courtyard without them cutting to her was really creepy, and I loved it.
Â 
-naked Mel/batshit Selyse
Â 
-Hot Pie, or more appropriately Ser-Never-Gives-Up-On-the-Gravy
Â 
-I liked Tyrion's scenes with Jaime, Bronn and of course Oberyn
Â 
-Dat slap
1892	MarieAntoinette	2014-05-19	Oberyn & Tyrion
Bronn & Tyrion
Hotpie
The Kiss between LF and Sansa was perfectly creepy
LF shoving Lysa
1893	OnlyOne	2014-05-19	Â 
I've always wondered why Lysa was so damn obsessive about her son when she never liked Jon Arryn very much.

You don't think that's Jon Arryns son, do you?
1894	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-19	Loved the triumphant return of Hot Pie. Glad to see that he's honed his skills. That wolfbread was spot-on! I was much more entertained by that sequence alone than I was by Brienne's entire journey in the books.Â
1895	gash	2014-05-19	tyrion and oberyn's scene was tremendous. arya was pretty bad ass too.
1896	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-19	I also thought Oberyn was spot on.. Pedro has really done that character justice. And IMO they NAILED the Bronn scene as well. That was such a cool scene in the books, they really went all out with it.Â
1897	Angmar	2014-05-19	The Return of Hot Pie.
Â 
Sansa Winterfell Castle/Moon Door/etc etc
Â 
Arya and the Hound
1898	protar	2014-05-19	Hot Pie is back! Best cameo ever. Boy was I worried he'd be killed off or something.
1899	holycray	2014-05-19	The Tyrion/Oberyn scene was a powerful one. It was nice seeing Dany wear something other than the usual.

1900	protar	2014-05-19	The Tyrion/Oberyn scene was a powerful one. It was nice seeing Dany wear something other than the usual.


Â 
I think she may have just cut the old dress up a bit.
1901	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-05-19	I don't know why this episode made me want Dany to fail even more than I already do. She didn't even do anything wrong in this one.
1902	noelle	2014-05-19	After this season I'm going to read all books avoidable.Â 
(until now I have read only Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings)
I like being suprised every Monday but my appetite grows with eating.
Â 
Brienne on the screen = smile on my face
Â 
Aria and Hound, smile No. it feels like movie 'LA©on'
Â 
Lollys and Bron marriage... Good new. She could always have been wed to someone cruel. Bron's so indifferent.
Â 
Oberon and Tyrion, another great scene.
Â 
Sansa may behaved less mature than I would expect but it doesn't change the fact that I have positive feelings for her (at the beginning of the series I didn't)
Â 
...liked her slapping the kid and Lysa Tully death :> (although Littlefinger could just push her, without telling her such awful goodbye words)
I thought Sansa's gonna be abused by her aunt for a long time. What a suprise.
1903	The Fenris Wolf	2014-05-19	Man I loved this entire episode. Â It's tough to point out what in particular I like the most.
Â 
1. Dinklage's acting during the conversations with Bronn and Oberyn. Â Holy cow the directors lucked out when they got that actor.
2. I LOVED the Hound's reaction when Biter attacked him, and then his short conversation with Rorge. Â Reminded me of a scene in an old Western. Â Perfect portrayal of a man who has lived around violence for his entire life.
3. Selyse's incredible craziness and discomfort with people. Â The woman is just a total social failure.
4. Melisandre is an absolute hammer.
5. Thought it was interesting how they showed Brienne already starting to respect Pod's judgement. Â Just like Tyrion, she goes from thinking she doesn't want him around, to considering him a burden, to grudging respect, and finally to rely on him.
1904	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-05-19	Every scene with Tyrion was great, each one better than the last. 
Hot Pie was great!

1905	lostinasia	2014-05-19	Hot Pie is back! Best cameo ever. Boy was I worried he'd be killed off or something.


Oh, the show's not over yet. Although he's probably considerably safer now that Arya's well on her way - I'd assumed seeing Hot Pie's murdered body would be yet another of Arya's steps into darkness, but I suppose that won't happen now.
1906	RoamingRonin	2014-05-19	The scene with Arya, the Hound and the Wounded Man. It's one of my favorite scenes from book 3. They changed a lot of the dialogue but I enjoyed it all the same.Â 
Biter coming out of nowhere scared the hell out of me.Â  
Â 
Hot Pie's cameo was the best thing ever. I really liked the scenes with him, Brienne and Pod. I like how they are showcasing the food and eating this season.Â

1907	Empress In The North	2014-05-19	The Eyrie covered in snow.
Â 
Beautiful. Had a great atmosphere.
1908	Er Rn	2014-05-19	Sansa's snow castle scene was beautiful.
Oberyn's monologue to Tyrion was excellent.
1909	HouseTavarez	2014-05-19	oberyn/tyrion scene
Â 
tyrion/bronn scene
1910	LionsAndTitsAndWineOhMy	2014-05-19	The fact that everyone who interacted with Peter Dinklage this episode was also brilliant, it makes me wonder if he has some kind of magic that rubs off on people. Â Chemistry? Â Maybe, but wouldn't it be more fun/offensive to believe the cast follows Volantene custom of rubbing his head for luck?
Â 
It was all about pairs this episode: Â Tyrion/Everyone, Arya/Hound, Melisandre/Selyse, Mel's Right Boob/Mel's Left Boob,Â Sansa/Petyr,Â Brienne/Pod...good stuff!
1911	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-20	Pedro Pascal


+1.
Â 
And I hope you'll agree with me Mark, how awesome was Cersei's appreciatively looking over the mountain and nonchalantly waling over blood and guts??? Even though the scene itself was crap, Lena's Cersei is just great.
Â 
Sandor's ''You think you're alone?''
Â 
ughhhhh I love him so much.Â
1912	Mark Antony	2014-05-20	And I hope you'll agree with me Mark, how awesome was Cersei's appreciatively looking over the mountain and nonchalantly waling over blood and guts??? Even though the scene itself was crap, Lena's Cersei is just great.


Agreed so much. Lena is awesome. She made that scene
1913	aameen	2014-05-20	http://i.imgur.com/9pza9xd.jpg
this.Â 
best cameo evar.
1914	LordStoneheart	2014-05-20	Probably a backhanded compliment, but Cersei walking over peasant guts was probably the best Lena has ever done with Cersei.Â
1915	Wsaharan	2014-05-20	Quite a lot actually. I'm going to add B&P rambling around the countryside (Hot Pie!). I'm looking forward to leaving all, well most of the KL intrigue behind. I'm not saying it was bad, I'm just tired of it.
Also, the less KL, the less pointless brothel scenes.
I hope.
Also, I really liked the Eyrie scene, but they could have given the snow castle just ONE more minute though with "winterfell" in the background...
1916	solidviper	2014-05-20	I really love Oberyn. He's such a good character with an amazing actor behind it all. He's incredibly attractive to me as well.Â
1917	Michael Herman	2014-05-20	I rewound the Tyrion and Bronn scene and opened aSoS to the right page, the dialogue is some of the most faithful to the books in the whole series.
1918	A Misunderstood Skagosi	2014-05-20	Glad to see Hot Pie again because it reminded me of the only scene in the books that actually made me laugh out loud.Â  In ACOK when Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie are fighting Ser Amory's men in the holdout, Arya is yelling "Winterfell!" while hacking at a soldier and Hot Pie yelling "Hot Pie!" along with her.Â  I'm not sure if GRRM meant for humor in that fight sequence but I just couldn't help finding it hilarious picturing this chubby kid swinging his sword and yelling "Hot Pie!"
1919	Archmaester	2014-05-20	Pedro's delivery of "and what about what I want"... awesome!Â 
Â 
Aiden Gillen
Â 
Lysa's crazy screeching at Sansa... "He's Miiiine!"
1920	7th-key	2014-05-21	- Oberyn!
Â 
- Dany's morning after dress.
Â 
- NCW's Jaime.
1921	Ambitious Lannister	2014-05-21	When Sansa slapped Robert.
Â 
I really enjoy the dynamic that is developing between Brienne and Pod.
Â 
Oberyn because he's just awesome.
Peter Dinklage's acting is always amazing (especially during Oberyn's story of seeing him for the first time)
Lysa staring at Petyr kiss Sansa like a stage 5 clinger.
1922	tyrell19	2014-05-22	all performances were excellent but for me in this ep stand outs were Dickie and Pascal. I think they both capture their book counterparts briliantly
1923	Lady Winter Rose	2014-05-22	I loved and hated Dany and Daario scene. First time I seen it, I was sad Dany has become a domina, but then I realized that Dany has showed her perverse side and I like that direction.
Â 
I also don't like there isn't a topic about Dany and Daario scene, but don't want to open a new one because there is probably another one, just waiting for approval.
1924	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-22	I know many weren't impressed, but I enjoyed the Melisandre/Selyse scene. Yes the nudity was unneccessary, but I enjoyed the show attenpting to make Mel more "human" with her attempts at humour (the thing with R'hllor and the bath) and Selyse failing to understand it  Also glad that they revealed the powders and vials which provide most of the facade of power
	Spoiler  and really, that this is revealed earlier than in the novels doesnt bother me 

The ending of that scene also left me suitably concerned for Shireen. 
Loved the episode as a whole, this is just one I am pointing out
1925	Indigocell	2014-05-22	I rewound the Tyrion and Bronn scene and opened aSoS to the right page, the dialogue is some of the most faithful to the books in the whole series.


Â 

	Spoiler I got the same impression while watching that scene but didn't have a book with me to verify.Â  Let me ask you, do you get the impression they parted as amicably in the books as they did in the show? I'm curious about that after watching a recent review of the episode.

1926	Martini Sigil	2014-05-22	I always like a lot more than i don't... I did like how they got the same actor to play Rorge to come back and get stabbed hahahahahahaha
1927	Newstar	2014-05-23	I read the book version of Oberyn's anecdote, and aside from everything else I said before about recontextualizing Oberyn's story from a nasty little tale told to push Tyrion's buttons into a show of empathy and recognition of Tyrion's humanity, and a way of communicating to Tyrion that he understands how much Cersei hates Tyrion, which was amazing, I was impressed at how the story was trimmed down from book to screen. The essence was there, but in reading the book version, it seemed to have a lot of excessive verbiage. The TV version of the story was simpler, with fewer digressions, asides, and details, and cut right to the heart of the story without losing anything. It was a great bit of adaptation work.
1928	Bold Barry Whitebeard	2014-05-23	Â

Â 
They parted much more amicably than in the book.Â  In the book, Tyrion isn't really bitter at Bronn, since he knows the kind of person he is and understands it.
Â 
In the show, they shake hands and part as friends.
1929	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-23	Oberyn's line...
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters."
Â 
 Â  Â
1930	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-24	Oberyn and Tyrion was perfect. Amazing scene. 
Bronn and Tyrion was perfect. Amazing scene
Jaime and Tyrion was perfect. 
Awesome scene. 
"I hope the hear them sing it"
1931	Starkian	2014-05-24	I really liked all the Tyrion scenes.
And the wolf shaped bread was awesome!
1932	Stark'sBastard	2014-05-24	The set design and make up was gorgeous.Â
1933	Lady Arwen	2014-06-01	The new Wolf Pie gave me many feels. I love Hot Pie! And I love that he still calls it "Winterhell".Â

1935	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-05-19	Why he doesn't look a day over 26!
1936	TFP	2014-05-19	I did cringe slightly about an actor in his mid 40s telling a story about his character's (strongly implied older, as in the books) brother, played by an actor in his mid 20s. Oh well...
					
					
							Edited by TFP, 19 May 2014 - 03:26 AM.
1937	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-19	The blood of peasants is a great moisturiser.
1938	Tankbuster	2014-05-19	Gregor Clegane looked so adorbz, like wun wun's little brother. Who's a wittle bloodthirsty maniac, yes you are...yes you are.
1939	Envie	2014-05-19	Ugh, yeah - the actor is in his early thirties at most and far too likable looking. If massive size and muscles were the only qualifications on the job description, I think they could have found any number of hulking large dudes who looked a lot older and more evil ... this guy even had a nice tan and smooth skin - way too pretty for the horrific monster "The Mountain" was described as in the books. Oh well - it was my ONLY one tiny nitpick in the entire episode - I absolutely loved the rest of the scenes - amazingly powerful episode.
1940	Roose Seal	2014-05-19	Yeah he's too cuddly looking.
Â 
Conan Stevens in S1 was perfect, he was not nearly as big, but he had that crazy face. This new guy just looks like he wants to cuddle and watch reruns of Who's the Boss
1941	Red Tiger	2014-05-19	He looks like a giant teddybear. I can just imagine Cersei holding him for comfort when going to sleep and it's not even sexual (raped Elia? Oberyn YOU LIAR!).
1942	Batman	2014-05-19	Very disappointed with their third try. He does not have the proper nasty streak in him that the first one did.
1943	TheEvilKing	2014-05-19	I'm not too concerned about the actor, he doesn't need to do much. But why the hell was he killing random villagers in front of a pile of weapons, and why weren't they just fleeing?
1944	TFP	2014-05-19	...why the hell was he killing random villagers in front of a pile of weapons, and why weren't they just fleeing?I suppose i assumed that they were all accused criminals on trial. Maybe 'crown prosecution service' is very much a regular gig for the mountain in the show (though if so you'd think that tyrion would just assume that the mountain would fight his champion)? I suppose the implication was that he's so formidable that processing cases bulk is just the sensible, expedient, way to do the job?
					
					
							Edited by TFP, 19 May 2014 - 05:56 AM.
1945	Red Tiger	2014-05-19	In all seriousness, I think he's a good casting. He is tall, muscular as hell and the fact that he basically looks like a huge testosteroine-poisoned baby with a giant sword makes him all the creepier IMO.
1946	Zorn Gottes	2014-05-19	I'm not too concerned about the actor, he doesn't need to do much.


he had one job: to look menacing
1947	Red Tiger	2014-05-19	he had one job: to look menacing 


Yeah, if you saw a guy with that combo of height and muscle coming your way with a 6 foot long sword, you would feel pretty screwed.
1948	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-19	Very disappointed with their third try. He does not have the proper nasty streak in him that the first one did.

Apart from killing more innocents in 20 seconds than both other actors combined?
1949	Roose Seal	2014-05-19	Apart from killing more innocents in 20 seconds than both other actors combined?


Meh. A freakishly tall and buff man with a baby face cutting down scrawny little dudes is not really all that impressive.
Now a slightly larger than average guy with a crazy face cutting a horse in half... how that is memorable.
1950	Zorn Gottes	2014-05-19	Yeah, if you saw a guy with that combo of height and muscle coming your way with a 6 foot long sword, you would feel pretty screwed.


Size matters but in my opinion on screen a shorter actor with more evil (facial) looks would have worked much better than a huge teddy bear like this one
ETA: I don't usually practice the sports of complaining about the show and I gave him the benefit of the doubt but now I must say he doesn't look manacing at all, I also think they added that nonsense scene with the peasants because "hey people, look: this guy is a brutal monster!", something you could never tell by his expression.

This! Why did they even drop Conan anyway?

Um, Conan Stevens is taller than Hafthor Bjornsson, though he weighs about 80-100 lbs less.  Conan definitely had a meaner looking face that fit the Mountain better, IMO.  
Hafthor is WAY better than Ian Whyte.
1953	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-19	This! Why did they even drop Conan anyway?

He got a better gig
1954	Tim Thomason	2014-05-19	I'm not too concerned about the actor, he doesn't need to do much. But why the hell was he killing random villagers in front of a pile of weapons, and why weren't they just fleeing?


Â 
They were chained up, with a gaoler nearby. I assume they were all peasant prisoners (maybe captured in the Riverlands, if not all from Flea Bottom) being used as "target practice" by Gregor for his championship bout. He didn't know who he was fighting, but he knew he was there to fight a singular individual.
Â 


This! Why did they even drop Conan anyway?


Â 
Opinions and statements vary, but I believe the general consensus is that Conan Stevens refused to come back for the Season 2 cameo, because he was filming The Hobbit movies in New Zealand, and the production decided never to hire him again.
1955	Roose Seal	2014-05-19	Um, Conan Stevens is taller than Hafthor Bjornsson, though he weighs about 80-100 lbs less. Conan definitely had a meaner looking face that fit the Mountain better, IMO.
Hafthor is WAY better than Ian Whyte.


Maybe, but the way they filmed it (with the low angles, and no full body shots) made Bjornsson look freakishly tall, while Stevens just looked pretty tall.
1956	Magjee	2014-05-19	Opinions and statements vary, but I believe the general consensus is that Conan Stevens refused to come back for the Season 2 cameo, because he was filming The Hobbit movies in New Zealand, and the production decided never to hire him again.


Â 
The season 2 cameo is understandable for another actor.
Â 
Would have been nice to have Conan back for Season 4, since this time we actually have to see the Mountain's face
1957	Red Tiger	2014-05-19	Maybe, but the way they filmed it (with the low angles, and no full body shots) made Bjornsson look freakishly tall, while Stevens just looked pretty tall.


To be fair, the only character we see Stevens standing next to is Sandor Clegane, who is pretty tall as it is. Bjornsson's standing next to Cersei.
1958	The Dragon has three heads	2014-05-19	This scene was embarrassing.
That's all I have to say about it.
1959	Unbowed Unbent Unhodor	2014-05-19	Maybe he uses Lorieal anti-aging wrinkle cream.
1960	Batman	2014-05-19	Apart from killing more innocents in 20 seconds than both other actors combined?


Â 
Its the way you do it. He did not sell it. When he spoke to Cersei he didn't sell it. When Mountain one cut off the head of that horse you believed he was a vicious sadistic monster. Conan Stevens sells it, this new guy does not.Â
1961	Sigrunn	2014-05-19	This scene was embarrassing.


Â 
Sadly, this is true. Â
1962	Carne	2014-05-19	The scene felt really awkward. Probably the one I liked least in this episode.
1963	Jamie Lannister	2014-05-19	Why the fuck didn't they just keep his helmet on?Â 
Â 
The guy looks massive and imposing, but yeah, he's too young. That's fine. The character coincidentally happens to have an iconic suit of imposing black armour to conceal this. I mean shit, the guy had one line.Â Why was it necessary to show his face at all in that scene?Â 
Â 
For a show that dumbs down dialogue because it thinks its audience is too stupid to grasp a few subtleties, it sure does like confusing them in more pointless and avoidable ways.
1964	ipsuel	2014-05-19	This scene was embarrassing.
That's all I have to say about it.


It really was. It just felt so silly. It took me out of Kings Landing and into giggling for a few minutes because it was just that bad.Â
1965	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-19	Bet Conan is kicking himself in the ass now that his performance in the Hobbit got completely removed and reduced by PJ to another CGI Jar Jar looking orc.
1966	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-05-19	Bet Conan is kicking himself in the ass now that his performance in the Hobbit got completely removed and reduced by PJ to another CGI Jar Jar looking orc.


Â 
LOL, I second this!
Â 
But seriously, Conan WAS the Mountain. As disappointing as it is, I still think Hafthor did a great job. The way he silently shook his head after being told "Does it matter"... That's the closest we've gotten to the Mountain since season 1, IMO.

1967	Greywolf2375	2014-05-19	look at it this way....we're not going to have to see him with a baby face for too long.
1968	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-19	I didn't think he was that bad. I think the head shake was subtle enough to be convincing.
Â 
Look, they picked some strongman kid to fill a role. Don't hate on him. Hate on Conan, he's the one that pulled the plug for a "better" gig. It's no ones fault but his own. he thought being in a Peter Jackson movie, caked in make up and prosthetic so he's unrecognizable would be better for his career (seemed like a great idea right?).
1969	random girl from westeros	2014-05-19	That guy is no the terrifying Mountain, this guy looks sweet like I want hug him.

Â 
Except Conan's Hobbit role was not the reason they didn't ask him back? He even said that himself. It's more likely he didn't get on with D&D as was apparently said by one of the extras at the tourney.
1971	Red Tiger	2014-05-19	That guy is no the terrifying Mountain, this guy looks sweet like I want hug him.


So does Wyman Manderly. A person's actions can make up for a lot.
1972	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-19	I thought he was good. 
Who am I fighting?
Does it matter?
*shakes head*
They hire an actual mountain of a man and people still complain lol. Because he looked cuddly whilst disemboweling peasants somehow :S
I agree s1 mountain was awesome though.
1973	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-19	He looked about as cuddly as an actual, that is to say not teddy, bear

Â 
It's still his fault he left then. Not the new kids. If he was that difficult to work with that he's seemingly the only person to have beef w/ D&D out of a cast of hundreds...
Â 
I don't entirely buy the Hobbit not being the reason either, sounds like something Conan would say to cover for a poor career choice that sounded good at the time.

1975	boojam	2014-05-19	This! Why did they even drop Conan anyway?He did get a bigger , in a way, part in Peter Jackson's trilogy of the Hobbit... I think that knocked him out of season 2.Story goes, he did want back when he became free. Which he would have been or could have been for this season.Then it's all a mystery, he spoke of some hush hush dealings , I guess with Dave and Dan , or maybe HBO.Something went wrong, or was he black listed by HBO.Stevens wont talk about it.
1976	TFP	2014-05-19	For sure they could have used a bit of make up to age him up and/or give him a couple of scars and so on.
1977	Tankbuster	2014-05-19	So does Wyman Manderly. A person's actions can make up for a lot.

Â 
Â 
I could swear I saw a picture somewhere where they did this. I facial shot where he was a bit wrinkled. Maybe it just didn't translate in that scene or maybe they didn't film him like that.
1979	Oberoth	2014-05-19	Ugh, yeah - the actor is in his early thirties at most and far too likable looking.

Â

Agreed but now I am kinda hoping they had gotten Nathan Jones as the new Mountain.
He does convincing scary and has the real life history to back it up.
1986	Ferrum Aeternum	2014-05-19	HafthorÂ was better than I was expecting, but still not as convincing as Conan was in S1.Â  He just exuded rage and deadly violence in a way that I'm not sure Hafthor is capable of.Â  Hoping I'm wrong in two weeks!
1987	boojam	2014-05-19	Someone said earlier, or on another thread -- just leave a helm on him. Easy fix Â :-) But even had they done that, the scene was still laughable.I think in E8 that's what they do... good.But Lord! do Dave and Dan hate helms!Maybe to upset Geroge!
1988	MacNille	2014-05-19	He was good enough for me. I have seen part of the preview for the next one, and he makes Oberyn look like a dwarf.

Â 
He looked menacing to me . . . solid muscles, thick, great athletic ability . . Â yep he would probably could handle all the folks in here critical of his appearance pretty easy.
Â 
I am not one of them. I think he's a great choice and I am glad he's a nice guy in person . . imagine of he was a real monster with a body that fierce!!Â
1990	Damon_Tor	2014-05-19	I'm not too concerned about the actor, he doesn't need to do much. But why the hell was he killing random villagers in front of a pile of weapons, and why weren't they just fleeing?


Well anyone of noble blood can ask for trial by combat, even those whose "noble blood" is no longer accompanied by lands or riches.Â  These guys were probably some smart-asses who thought "hey, I'm looking at a sure conviction anyway, and my hand will get taken off.Â  Since my great great great grandfather was supposedly knighted, I'll ask for a trial by combat!Â  Maybe I'll get lucky."
Â 
And so "execution by combat" becomes a regular occurrence, where some gold cloak or another will go in will full armor and get some exercise cutting down random schmucks who are only given a token weapon.Â  On this particular day, of course, the Mountain was in town.Â  "We've got a special surprise for you lot today." perhaps they were told.
1991	Chebyshov	2014-05-19	He was good enough for me. I have seen part of the preview for the next one, and he makes Oberyn look like a dwarf.


Â 
It'll work, IMO. He does have a bit of a jolly face, but it's fine. At least Robert Strong won't have a head, so if they keep this actor, we'll just get stature, and not derpyness.
1992	ovis alba	2014-05-19	For sure they could have used a bit of make up to age him up and/or give him a couple of scars and so on.


Â 
I think more hair and more beard might have already helped.
1993	Yojimbo	2014-05-19	TBH I am just thinking it was todo with the way it was shot this episode, it was from a low angle perspective. When the trial by combat happens we will truely get to see the 'mountains' size because Bjornsson is huge!
Â 
Bjornsson (Gregor) is 6'9, with an endomorph body type and one of the biggest body builders in the world. Where as Pascal (Oberyn) is only 5'11, with an ecto/mesomorph body type and has the same body fitness as 'most' male actors. I really hope the show puts in a shot of Bjornsson standing next to Dinkladge, because they are literally polar opposites in size comparison between humans.

Â 
I think the mistake was casting "The Mountain" (i.e. thinking too much in terms of sheer size) and not enough on the look and character. I think fans would much prefer a smaller, less physically intimidating guy but with that Javier Bardem-look in No Country for Old Men: A seriously sick and dangerous man.

Â 
The age thing, I'll give you that. The guy is in his mid twenties I think, looks like in his mid thirties, but he doesn't look older than the Hound. Okay.
Â 
But his face looking too nice? Who cares what his face looks like? This guy isÂ huge and they show him slaughtering normal sized men with a giant greatsword like they were kids. Call me intimidated. Do evil people need an evil facial structure? Should he grow a villain's moustache as well? Twirl it a little, so that we won't forget he's a bad guy?

They actually managed to cast one of the largest men in the world as the Mountain, be content with that.Â

No, that way I'd confuse him with Littlefinger
2002	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-19	The one thing I didn't like about him was his elbows. They seemed too pointy.
2003	of man and wolf	2014-05-19	Meh. A freakishly tall and buff man with a baby face cutting down scrawny little dudes is not really all that impressive.
Now a slightly larger than average guy with a crazy face cutting a horse in half... how that is memorable.


Conan was taller than this guy by quite a bit. Just leaner, but heavier than the second dude too.
Â 
I think Kurrgan from wrestling and some films would have been better than any. He can look imposing and also menacing, and he has that face that also looks like he could be older than Sandor.
Â 
They shouldn't have let the Mountain be seen without his armour and shield on. Keeps the myatery there and he'd look far more imposing to viewers that way.

Its the way you do it. He did not sell it. When he spoke to Cersei he didn't sell it. When Mountain one cut off the head of that horse you believed he was a vicious sadistic monster. Conan Stevens sells it, this new guy does not.Â 


Â 
BTW - I saw the episode with my buddy who has not read the books. Â A few minutes after the new Mountain killing scrawny guys scene, he asked, "Where is the Mountain?" Â He didn't realize he had just seen the Mountain because Conan Stevens made such an impression back in Season 1.

I told him that big guy was the Mountain, and he said, "That KID? Â He's the Hound's OLDER brother?? Â What happened to the first guy?"

Most Unsullied I know still remember the Mountain vividly as "that guy who decapitated the horse in s1" so like you said, they really didn't need another intro like this to show how brutal he was.Â
2009	voodooqueen126	2014-05-19	I actually think it is interesting that people speculate that Conan Steven's didn't return as the Mountain because his personality was difficult to work with.
Since he was the only actor who really nailed the character (Brutal and Scary).
Where as this guy, despite his small piggy eyes, looks rather babyish.

For all those being dismissive of the criticism that casting a guy much too young to be Rory's / Sandor's older brother - I hope they read this. Your buddy is not the only one who is going to remember how intimidating (and older) the first Gregor Clegane looked and acted in season 1 - not many true fans could possibly forget that horrific scene.
Â 
Unfortunately they've left a lot of Gregor's 'reputation' in the Riverlands out of the show and so many will forget - but even with reminders (recaps?) they're still going to have a hard time buying that this much younger guy is Gregor's older brother. It's just not believable. I know, the original guy quit and nobody remembers the second one (not even me) - so they did what they did... but I think it would have been important to cast someone who looked more closely like the original guy and then use camera trickery to 'size him up' larger if necessary. This new guy is big, and brawny and yes, they did a gory scene for him - but he still doesn't look as sadistically scary ... size doesn't matter in this case.

Yes they did make a good choice. Â I didn't even pay attention to how old he looked he was freaking terrifying his size and bulk. I thought was was taller than 6'9" .

Probably. IMO he looks sweet and a little derpy. It worked better in the show with his lines and the ominous music in the back, but I just think he has a kind look to him.

But this may have colored my initial impression:Â http://images.tvrage...of-thrones1.jpg
2014	Daenerys Must Die	2014-05-19	Well fortunately he'll be in full plate & helm next episode so as long as he pulls the fight off well then I will be very happy - his sheer athleticism will probably help in that regard .. as for the actor I'd say shirtless Ramsay is more menacing looking ..

I actually do believe it though. They had a scene with him as the Mountain...so now I know he's the new Mountain. I'm not sitting here now theorizing he's really Benjen because his beard wasn't longer. With all the things wrong with this show we should be lucky we got who we got.
2016	David Selig	2014-05-19	On this show the ages of the adult actors and their characters are so out of whack I am not even noticing such discrepancies anymore. No big deal. He is a huge guy and that's what matters to me. And you don't have to look monstrous and all creepy to be a monster.

 :agree:and must add my voice to the criticism. I give the guy the benefit of the doubt because we only see him briefly but still he didn't leave a very good impression. Like others pointed out, he didn't seem menacing enough, scary, sadistic or batshit crazy despite his size and the fact that he was dismantling peasants throughout the whole scene. The season 1 Mountain was on-screen only for 5 seconds or so but he was so fucking scary and gave me nightmares, exactly like his book counterpart. I watched season 2, twice or possibly even three times and I never even noticed that Gregor was in it so it says a lot about the replacement.
Â 
I too would prefer someone older, hardened, meaner looking with an obvious sadistic streak even if he wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t as muscular and big as this guy.

Exaggerate much? Crackpot theories can stick with the book purists. Â

I LOVED the entire episode. This one discrepancy is my only tiny nitpick in the entire thing. So don't quote me as an overly critical purist because I'm far from it. I don't mind 99% of the changes made from the book. I took exception to the awkward "Theon bungled Rescue attempt" last week as did many others but other then that they're doing a bang up job every week.Â

Gregor's actor just looks too young and good natured - that's my only beef.
2022	Eddard the Builder	2014-05-19	Â 
Except Conan's Hobbit role was not the reason they didn't ask him back? He even said that himself. It's more likely he didn't get on with D&D as was apparently said by one of the extras at the tourney.

2024	Eddard the Builder	2014-05-19	Â 
They should write contracts binding them for several seasons.


Â 
If they wrote a binding contract I'm pretty sure they'd have to make him either recurring or a starring cast member. Â Which likely entails a certain amount of scenes. Â I am surprised some people aren't starring roles yet (like Barristan)
2025	TFP	2014-05-19	My quick summary then:
Â 
(a) The Gregor actor's age [and lack of makeup/ageing effects or similar] is clearly a nonsense given the Sandor actor's age but I'm not sure that this really matters all that much.
{b}Â His look is more or less perfect. I don't really buy that he's not tall enough. Roughly thirty stone [i.e. 420lbs]Â in weight [as per book] is ideal. Sure, he's nowhere near eight feet tall butÂ I always found that detail difficult to swallow anyway. In our world at least, people as a rule just don't get to that height without some very serious health issues.
[c]Â His 'acting' seems a bit lacklustre - in S01 Conan StevensÂ was superbly deranged when roaring for his squire to bring GC's sword over to enable him to decapitate his horse... we saw nothing like this from the new guy.
Â 
Â 
Overall I'd say good but not great.

2030	Wunhopkuendo	2014-05-19	I too am not a fan of this new mountain. One look at him and all I can think is "I didn't know they had gold's gym in westeros." I know the mountain is supposed to be a very big guy, but the guy in season 1 played him perfectly. I know they can't always bring actors back, but this guy is comically huge and it just doesn't work. Keep in mind that I rarely ever criticize the show, but this is one of those rare occasions. Hopefully they will keep him in armor the whole fight with Oberyn and he will not look so cheesy as the scene of him cleaving up peasants for fun.
2031	Labirints	2014-05-19	The season 1 Mountain was absolutely perfect for the role. This one is at least better than the one from season 2 or 3.
2032	MarieAntoinette	2014-05-19	He was alright. I agree that the actor is too young, but he's got the stature. I prefer him to the guy the cast in season 2. Â I'll judge after the next episode.

Â I just wanted to point out that in the books, The Mountain is 8 ft. tall. (244 cm). George is horrible when he describes heights as this is completely unrealistic. The largest actively fit man I have ever seen or heard about is six inches shorter than that. His character in the books is completely cartoonish.
Â 
Â I personally loved Conan Steven's representation as well. I wish things could have worked out for him to reprise his role this season. Here is a cool interview that he did last year about the role of Gregor.
Â 
http://hbowatch.com/...-conan-stevens/
Â 
The bottom line is that for reason of production schedule, budget, and other work issues, a casting decision had to be made. I personally like the physical presence that Hafthor brings to the table, and from the small clips that I have seen, I believe that he is going to do an amazing job in the fight.Â

But his face looking too nice? Who cares what his face looks like? This guy isÂ huge and they show him slaughtering normal sized men with a giant greatsword like they were kids. Call me intimidated. Do evil people need an evil facial structure? Should he grow a villain's moustache as well? Twirl it a little, so that we won't forget he's a bad guy?
Â 
Some people...
Â 
They actually managed to cast one of the largest men in the world as the Mountain, be content with that.Â 


Imo, big isn't all that scary -- "big" doesn't make one a villian.Â It's the love of violence and killing, the lack of humanity, and the satisfaction he gets from it... this is what people fear (on top of the fact that he's crazy-big/strong).
Â 
And it's not only a face thing -- it's also an eyes thing. Seeing evil or malice in someone's eyes goes a long way toward making a character seem more realistic. Not Snidley Whiplash eyes -- just someone who looks/ACTS capable of the Mountain's acts.Â

This is what I meant when I referred to George being horrible at describing heights. It is not an insult, he acknowledges this as a weakness as well. The 700-800 ft. tall wall is a mistake. An arrow shot from the ground by any longbow will travel less than 300 ft. In the books, they were hitting the top of the wall.
Â 
Â When George is describing heights in his books, I transcribe mentally to keep my suspension of disbelief active. I did this for the wall, and I also did this for Clegane's height. The point of the character is that he is substantially taller and stronger than everyone else in the world, not his exact dimensions.Â

2046	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-19	Well, Gregor has had - what - 5 episodes he has been in?Â  So it's not like there was a lot in Got for him either.Â 


Â 
Better than basically 0 scenes in which you can't even identify the actor. The duel with Oberyn will be one of the more memorable moments of the entire show.

The dragons and magic are defined as possible within the show universe. Gregor being like 2 feet taller than any other human being while still being incredibly agile and healthy is just inconsistent, but that's not even the point...The point is you need to find actors capable of performing that role so you're not exactly going to have any luck finding an 8ft tall, 30-stone man.

2047	ground_control	2014-05-19	The scene itself was a complete failure in terms of concept and execution.
Â 
The setting was wrong AND pointless. Â In the books, Gregor is at Harrenhall and gets called back by Raven. Â In the show, nobody has mentioned where he is, but given the number of times he's been mentioned, it should have been easy to establish where he was and what he was doing (Polliver could have just mentioned it in episode 1). Tywin knows that Oberyn is hunting for the Mountain, so setting him in King's Landing is actually the worst choice possible.
Â 
Also, having him just killing people with no context is just stupid. Â He could get away with killing captives at Harrenhall or the Riverlands, or back in his own lands (all places where he is the highest local authority), but to be killing people in King's Landing, he should have some sort of legal authority backing it up. Â Something like, Tywin saying "dungeons are getting full since the Night's Watch hasn't stopped by lately, let's have Ser Gregor take over as King's Justice and sort things out, and then he'll be nearby if we need to give him to Prince Oberyn" at the last council meeting.
Â 
As far execution goes, I'm ok with the Mountain's casting, but there was no need to have him helmetless or shirtless. Â In addition to being older than Sandor, the focus in the fight scene is going to be him having raped Elia and murdered her and her children, so he needs to at least look old enough to have been a knight twenty years ago. Â Putting him in full armor would have made him look more impressive and scary (and made killing the people more terrifying), and he could have taken off his helm or lifted a visor when talking to Cersei.
Â 
To be honest, the number of times they've discussed Gregor in the show this season should have been enough to establish him, so this scene was really unnecessary to have even been included.
2048	Hanzo Hasashi	2014-05-19	Dude looked like a WWE wrestler. Â It didn't even look natural when he was wielding that sword. Ugh....

No, you don't.Â  The character wasn't written to be put on the screen - he written to be imagined.Â  Of course his size is inconsistent - that's the point - he is an utter freak of nature.Â  And we do have examples of exceptionally large, exceptionally capable people in the books - hell, Left & Right are 7 foot tall twins.
Â 
If they really needed him to be 8 feet tall, they could make it look that way - just like was done in LoTR with the Hobbits.Â  They didn't actually have to find someone 3' to play that role, nor did they need to find a basketball team of 7'+ to play Gandalf, Aragorn, etc.
2050	TheWeepingMan	2014-05-19	The casting is good, HafA3A3r BjA¶rnsson is literally one of the, dunno, 5 strongest people on earth, so that alone makes him utterly watchable.

The actor looks much more impressive here in some amateur photographs than in a professional high-budget tv-show:

They needed to do it with the Hobbits because otherwise it would be completely different. They've taken a character who was unrealistically large and used an actor that was really fucking big too. It's fine, they're not going to spend all of their time on special effects and camera tricks when it's completely pointless since you already have a huge enough guy that could be called "The Mountain."Â 
Â 
What the fuck is the point of arguing that a character isn't meant to be put on the screen when they have no choice but to put him on the screen, by the way?

Lots of people look older than they should. Â Someone like the Hound would invariably look much older because of his scars and the trauma he suffered. Â I doubt the Mountain has such depth of feeling.

Sadly, this is true. Â 

So sad indeed.
2059	Blazfemur	2014-05-19	My gripe I think is, aside from my utter discomfort and disgust for "recasting" roles (Daario, etc), the old Mountain from Season 1 not only looked the part, he played the part as well.
Â 
Season 1's Mountain, and Sandor, look as though they could be brothers. They had a great on-screen chemistry of what it looks like when two brothers hate each other.
Â 
I have to tranfer all of that chemistry, and hate, into new babyface Mountain. Sure, he's big, muscular, etc, i just don't think he played the part. His face needed a certain, gruffness and ferocity. This guy, looks menacing yes, but in a braggart school bully kinda way. The old mountain's menacing look? Estranged serial killer with a fetish for destruction and a look to match. The new Mountain looks like hes gonna give Oberyn a swirley whirley and take his lunch money.
Â 
If New Mountain were what I saw in season 1, and now he's back, i think i wouldve accepted it better. Season 1 Old Mountain was perfect, and better, and now i get the new mountain, and miss what we had.
Â 
Ah, first world problems.
2060	Vengeance	2014-05-19	Never mind his baby face, what about his VOICE, sounded like some weird Jamaican pastiche 'oooa mah fightin?'

2063	boojam	2014-05-19	I actually think it is interesting that people speculate that Conan Steven's didn't return as the Mountain because his personality was difficult to work with.Since he was the only actor who really nailed the character (Brutal and Scary).Where as this guy, despite his small piggy eyes, looks rather babyish.An odd thing about Conan Stevens is that besides having been a ballet dancer!!, he has trained as an actor and has an alsmost 10 year acting carreer. A look on IMDB shows he is not want for work!He has even been a play write.The guy fit the role to a T , maybe all the mystery will be cleared up someday.He seems a nice guy and have never heard of 'personality' problems about him.

I laughed hard at the image of the new Mountain giving swirley whirleys...but I think you crystallized the two kinds of menacing brute that S1 and S4 Ser Gregor represent, and why it probably wasn't the best recast decision to make.

My guess is this casting of the Mountain was more motivated by publicity than character. Â Yeah, I don't have anything to back that up aside from the performances, but I think they speak for themselves.

2073	lostinwesteros	2014-05-19	I think this new casting of The Mountain is horrible. Â It's only the second time in the entire HBO series that I have thought the casting was terrible (Mance is the other one), and all the rest have been just about perfect, IMHO. Â This Gregor looks like a giant in a fairy tale and seems to me to be totally unbelievable as a character in KL, certainly unbelievable as Sandor's brother. Â If this actor had been playing Gregor in the tournament scene in Season I, it would have been ridiculous, impossible to find a horse that seemed plausible for him to ride.

2087	Hruod Berht	2014-05-20	The actor who plays The Mountain, HafA3A3r JAolA­us BjA¶rnsson, is a 6'8" tall 400lb serial "World's Strongest Man" medal winner and the strongest man in Iceland.
I wonder how he would feel if he knew that the main criticism die-hard novel fans have of him is that he's too "cuddly" "pretty" "young" "likeable" and generally not menacing enough.
Â 
Amused I hope.
Â 
He probably has people IRL looking at him all day thinking "holy shit that guy's monstrous". 
Â 
ETA
Â 
Like others have noted his entrance scene is pretty jarring and felt to me like gore for the sake of it.
Â 
It would have been awesome if they'd shown us the scene with him and his men in the alehouse. It could've been set in KL or even on his way to it and would have made a nice visual mirror to The Hound's fight a few episodes ago. But I guess slicing the guts out of some chained peasants is more succinct.

2089	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-20	He does look young I admit. 
I loved his voice, even though obviously it was "wrong" because Westerlands accents are not Icelandic. 
He's huge though, can hold a broad sword one handed and he didn't really look cuddly whilst disemboweling people.
2090	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-20	Same. Wish they'd made some little comment to explain though, because it was very jarring.


Â 
Well I saw Gold Cloaks pushing them into fighting, and they'd laid down crude weapons for them to "defend themselves" with. I just assumed they were criminals to be executed but instead they made a little game of it to give Gregor some practice/fun.

Torture, torture, torture.Â
2093	boojam	2014-05-20	Probably makeup. Leana heady has a ton of ink, some of which iirc is on her neck, yet you'd never know it from any of her other roles (since Cersei is mostly covered). Doubt they spent CGI budget on removing tattoos.Â http://i.dailymail.c...483_306x477.jpgÂ They cover tattoos all the time.Â Jason Momoa...you never saw Drogo w/ any of this and he was always shirtless....though most of the foreamr stuff was probably covered in the braces.Â http://peninajoy.fil..._momoa_105_.jpgI knew about Lena. (In fact , did she do those when she was very young? Because even as artistic as they are, and as maverick as she is, does not seem to fit her personality, at least now.)Am not the least surprised about Jason... funny thing is , from the look of those tatoos they could have just let him keep em!... and given all the other Dothraki some tattoos!Fits the Dothraki tribal style anyway ... they are sort of nomadic bikers anyway.
2094	boojam	2014-05-20	Also rumour has it that Conan Stevens is a bit of a wanker and a nightmare to work with, aggressive etc...which would explain why he was essentially dropped from two major productions.Where did you see that?Can you site a reference?Because saw an interview with him in 2013 and came of as a very intellegent and articulate person.On production in season 1 I heard of no complaints about him.Now he may be a hard biz man, but that's another matter.
2095	Hotpie the Destroyer	2014-05-20	They should of casted Bas Rutten for The Mountain ; p
2096	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-20	I knew about Lena. (In fact , did she do those when she was very young? Because even as artistic as they are, and as maverick as she is, does not seem to fit her personality, at least now.)

Â 
I don't know about not fitting her personality...she doesn't seemed very ashamed of them at all since she's always in low cut items at events. She could easily hide that portion of her back in even more revealing gowns but chooses to show them off.
2097	Frumpus	2014-05-20	Probably the worst casting job I've ever seen. The dude in season 1 was perfect. This guy just looks like a big teddy bear.
However the episode was awesome.


Â 
I guess you missed season 2 Gregor
2098	Prince of the North	2014-05-20	Don't know where else to post this (NFL thread in Gen Chat maybe?) so I'll put it here:
Â 

Â 
Bjornsson's massive and imposing presence once caught the attention of an NFL team. Last year, Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay offered up one of his signature cryptic tweets about the colossus:
Â 
"Jim IrsayÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â<U+009C><U+0094> @JimIrsayÂ 

Â 
Off/Def Lineman,so many 6-3 to 6-7..320-365 lbs/Big,Physical and Nasty! Speaking of size/strength..GM Grig's just might sign "The Icelander"

Â 
A deal never materialized, which is a real shame. How could "The Mountain" not be money in the bank for 75 pass deflections and 250 offensive holding penalties? (I am listening to any and all GM job offers.)
Â 
We leave you with another shot of Bjornsson, this time lifting a soiled sword that appears to have the same measurements as the George Washington Bridge.
2099	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-20	about why he was butchering peasants, maybe those where peasants who demanded trial by combat?
its about the only reason i can think of
Â 
Well I saw Gold Cloaks pushing them into fighting, and they'd laid down crude weapons for them to "defend themselves" with. I just assumed they were criminals to be executed but instead they made a little game of it to give Gregor some practice/fun.

I agree, wish they had one small line explaining...I assumed from Cerseis comment that he was just practicing...but they weren't really fighting back, so might have been executions that he was doing just for the fun of it
2100	WildBlood	2014-05-20	he had one job: to look menacing 


Really his only job was to be a huge person...which I would say he was successful at.
2101	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-20	Anyone who says that him coming at them with that sword would result in anything but fear is lying or being overly dramatic. I like Conan better in the role myself but you guys are really stretching things. You wouldn't hug him, you'd shit your pants.

Â 
He's a fine casting choice and will be able to pull off the fight. There's just a cuddly look about him in general, whereas Conan managed "cruel" a bit better. But he's going to have minimal lines, and will look quite menacing next episode. Maybe they could even stick that bucket-helm back on him from season one, but they seem to be anti-helm these days.
2104	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-20	He's wearing the helm (for a while at least) in the duel.
2105	IlAovatar	2014-05-20	They should really have kept him in a full suit of armour throughout the entire season to limit confusion over the recasting.

2106	boojam	2014-05-20	I guess you missed season 2 GregorD and D have done some things I have not liked, but unlike some around here, I have not thought those things were horrendous.Casting Ian Whyte in season 2, now I find out he had a voice over!,... man that was the worst brain signal drop out for two very intelligent show runners I have seen so for GOT!
2107	A Misunderstood Skagosi	2014-05-20	The new Mountain certainly has the build for it 6'9" 400 lbs and has abs but I agree with a lot of people here, tough sell on being the older brother to the Hound.Â  I would assume the show has enough in the budget to put some kind of aging makeup.Â  Just becuase the guy has a receding hariline doesn't make up the fact that he could pass as the Hound's younger brother or even his son.Â  But truthfully it doesn't bother me, he'll have a helm on and a couple of short scenes where he is dying in agony.Â  Big improvement from the second mountain who had the body of Olive Oyl.
2108	Wunhopkuendo	2014-05-20	They should of casted Bas Rutten for The Mountain ; p


They should have. There's no such thing as "should of"

Right complexion, but not tall or bulky enough.
2110	Mark Antony	2014-05-20	They should have. There's no such thing as "should of"
Chill out Stannis
2111	Vengeance	2014-05-20	EY'A MON! OOO-A MAH FIGHTIN'?
2112	BassChamber	2014-05-20	Really his only job was to be a huge person...which I would say he was successful at.


Â 
No. Hodor is algo a huge person, but completely opposite to Gregor.
Â 
At least, they should have handle the situation in a better way, but they totally screwed it.
Â 
They should have show new mountain with his intimidating armor instead of shirtless!
Â 
He looked like a big teddy bear.
2113	Frumpus	2014-05-20	They should have just put aged makeup on his face to make him look his age and nobody would really be complaining. The different face is expected and the hair/beard was similar enough. Just give him some wrinkles and scars.
Â 
Thankfully he's in full armor for the duel so we can erase this misstep from our memory.

2114	Wunhopkuendo	2014-05-20	Chill out Stannis


Don't call me Stannis or D&D will assassinate my character. Haha sorry but I just couldn't resist. I really hate it when that term pops up after every Stannis scene. But not as much as I hate the term "whitewashing". I wonder if there is a program that will eliminate the word from my view whenever I'm on this site. It would make my forum time that much more enjoyable.
2115	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-20	I think the idea of the Shirtless Mountain was to show off the muscleman physique of the new actor.
He isn't as tall as Conan Stevens or Ian Whyte but is heavier and has more muscle mass.
2116	sj4iy	2014-05-20	I think the idea of the Shirtless Mountain was to show off the muscleman physique of the new actor.He isn't as tall as Conan Stevens or Ian Whyte but is heavier and has more muscle mass.Basically. He definitely looks like a man worthy of the title "The Mountain", whatever his face looks like.TBH, it was hard to even focus on his face during that scene because of all of the disemboweling going on.
2117	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-05-20	Terrible casting and his scene with Cersei was laughable
2118	Eddard the Builder	2014-05-20	This is what I meant when I referred to George being horrible at describing heights. It is not an insult, he acknowledges this as a weakness as well. The 700-800 ft. tall wall is a mistake. An arrow shot from the ground by any longbow will travel less than 300 ft. In the books, they were hitting the top of the wall.
Â 
Â When George is describing heights in his books, I transcribe mentally to keep my suspension of disbelief active. I did this for the wall, and I also did this for Clegane's height. The point of the character is that he is substantially taller and stronger than everyone else in the world, not his exact dimensions.Â 


Precisely, and consideringÂ HafA3A3r JAolA­us BjA¶rnsson is as of 2014 the second strongest man in the world he is absolutely perfect.
2119	Impish	2014-05-20	According to the ASOIAF Wiki, Gregor is supposed to be 5 years older than Sandor.
Â 
But on the show, HafA3A3r JAolA­us BjA¶rnsson is 25, and Rory McCann is 45... it's a little ridiculous for him to be presented as Sandor's older brother.
Â 
I really wish they'd at least added some grey streaks to his beard, a few scars... SOMETHING.
Â 
But in the grand scheme of things, it's pretty minor (just add "freakishly slow aging" to his accolades ). As long as he has a great fight with Oberyn, all will be forgiven.
2120	karna1983	2014-05-20	The first gregor was the best. He looked scary.
2121	The Lizard King	2014-05-20	And procured him some moisturizerÂ 


Â 
"It puts the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again..."
2122	ground_control	2014-05-20	Terrible casting and his scene with Cersei was laughable


The casting wasn't the problem, it was the wardrobe/makeup, writing, and directing staff that failed. Â Put him in armor (and a helm) for the first part (including his one line, which will be easier to overdub since we wouldn't see his lips moving, or maybe he'd sound good enough with some reverb). Â Have him take off the helm (or raise the visor) before answering Cersei's question (he had a good facial expression for that). Â It's not his fault that the scene was written like crap or that a previous actor was better, or that the director couldn't make the scene work.
Â 
Unless he (or his agent) negotiated for a shirtless scene, the majority of his "look" problem could have been solved by having him wear the armor ('cause we wouldn't want Unsullied asking who is the guy in armor in episode 8 thinking it was supposed to be the shirtless guy from episode 7).
2123	Faceless Athena	2014-05-20	HafA3A3r JAolA­us BjA¶rnsson is so adorable!!!! 
6'8 and 419 pounds
2124	acosta	2014-05-20	They cast him because he's one of very few, if any, people in the world his size who can perform the necessary fight choreography. They definitely should have covered him up or done something to try and age him, though. He doesn't look like he can be Sandor's older brother at all.Â
2125	Bear Island	2014-05-20	Shirtless Mountain reminded me so much of The Great Khali that I was expecting him to have Michael Cole pop up and start announcing the scene. Not that they're facially similar, just the stature and the outfit and the corny.

2128	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-21	I loved the way he said "ooh am a fightin" and the head shake. 
He's not quite what I imagined whilst reading but at least he's an absolute beast.
2129	Vvornth	2014-05-21	People in this thread are being blind to the realities of acting for the role of Ser Gregor Clegane.
Â 
The man will be in what, 5 episodes over 4 seasons, with very limited exposure. No actor can eschew other priorities and work to feature steadily on a show with such a sparse schedule.
2130	Nictarion	2014-05-21	Very disappointed with their third try. He does not have the proper nasty streak in him that the first one did.He's better than the 2nd guy, but nowhere near as good as the original Mountain. He was perfect.
2131	Batman	2014-05-21	He's better than the 2nd guy, but nowhere near as good as the original Mountain. He was perfect.

2133	Mighthearmeroar	2014-05-21	While his stature is and strength is impressive, I agree with those who find him to weak and not fearsome enough - looking. Size isn't what makes him terrifying, really, alhtough his physical prowess helps reinforce this. The books mentions he is a strange recluse, only leaving his home for fighting. The same home which somewhere is portrayed as a place of terror, with servants disappearing without trace.
Â 
The Mountain in S4 is huge and strong, yes. And i guess the killing peasants thing was to show the audience how evil he is. But it comes out a bit silly somehow. The angle when speaking to Cersei was a bit obvious in the way it wanted to show him taller than he is. But as some said, why not wear full armor? It would make sense too - him fully armored and armed against peasants. They would look even more defenseless and he would seem more of an immorale a**hole. Â
2134	JonInVa	2014-05-21	Besides the age difference he also looks 10 times the size of Rory, who when seen without armor was tall but relatively thin for a man who took on the Mountain at the Hands Tourney, and has always been setup as one of the few who "might" be able to hold his own with him. 
But once he's in armor and fighting Oberyn, it won't matter what he looked like shirtless anyway as everyone will be so engrossed in the scene they won't even think of it.
2135	LÂ<U+0092>Age dÂ<U+0092>or	2014-05-22	I like the guy, he was good in that limited time he got. As others have mentioned that interaction with Cersei was convincing.
2136	Indigocell	2014-05-22	Not as mean looking as Conan, but not as lanky and awkward looking as Ian.Â  It's unfortunate that Conan Stevens wasn't asked back for the role, I feel like there must be more to that story than his role in "The Hobbit."
Â 
I'm not too worried about it though, I can always super-impose Conan's face over Hafthor's in my head-canon.
2137	Petyr Patter	2014-05-23	I think the casting is fine.Â  I didn't get cuddly at all from the guy.Â  Unfortunately, something was lost in the writing, directing, and makeup for his introductory scene.
Â 
For starters, going shirtless was a big mistake.Â  Here's an almost identical picture of a different "strong man" shirt less: http://4.bp.blogspot...as hercules.jpg .
Â 
They are pretty similar looking.Â  That's right, shirtless Halfthor make viewers think of Kevin Sorbo's Hercules, a character and show famous for camp.Â  I get that they wanted to show off how well muscled he is, but unfortunately "body building" competitions have focused on the well defined muscles and easy to see muscles.Â  So, this has conditioned viewers to not equate Hafthor's bulk with immense strength.Â  Instead, he should have worn some kind of armor or other costume that denotes intimidation.Â 
Â 
I also think the show wanted an "over-the-top" re-introduction to the Mountain and in doing so... went over the top in a bad way.Â  His first scene is him screaming while holding his sword above his head with another man impaled upon it.Â  That isn't violent, that is "video-game"y.Â  Plus, without any context all we saw saw a man other men who had literally just picked their weapons from a pile on the ground.Â  He might as well have been practicing killing goats.Â  In season 1, watching the Mountain butcher a horse had a lot more impact because we know it was his own horse that had just failed him.
2138	ballajam	2014-05-23	He doesnt have that scary face. It is too round. He obvioulsy is not one of the better actors but he did his job which was to look huge and make the audience go "wow, how the hell is tyrion going to find someone to kill that guy!".Â 
Â 
But the dude is a tank. If you get a chance look him up on wikipedia, 2nd place in worlds strongest man, he can lift massive amounts of weight and he actually performed most of his stunts (according to an interview with him) and he looks good in full suit for the episode so I dont mind it at all.Â
2139	Sun	2014-05-23	Cuddly is exactly the word I would use to describe him. And that's not even the biggest problem with his scene.
2140	Mighthearmeroar	2014-05-28	I thought the peasant killing scene was just odd, and unnecessary. The Mountain doesn't need an introduction. He has been talked of and recognized as THE big bad guy for three seasons. It would have been much cooler if we never saw him before the actual fight. Just hearing about him and how everyone fears him would cause suspension enough. Everyone thinks he's invincible, Brann refuses to fight him, his old sins recapitulated, Sandor talks about his wound....and then, when the fight if about to commence, Oberyn stands ready, we see him enter in all his towering glory. What isn't shown is sometimes more terrifying than what is.Â

2144	OnlyOne	2014-06-08	Never mind his baby face, what about his VOICE, sounded like some weird Jamaican pastiche 'oooa mah fightin?'
Â 
The dialogue during the fight is going to be really jarring if he speaks like that. I guess he doesn't speak much English...couldn't they have dubbed him?

Agreed. Ugh. Truly terrible casting.
2145	The Old Tongue	2014-05-18	First of all, a major goof by depicting Mel without her ruby. I'm wondering if this was an oversight by the director or if mayhaps the producers are of the knowledge that the ruby is a trick like those at her shelf.
I'm also a little ticked off at how blatant the show is at suggesting the fate of Stannis' daughter. I don't remember it being so obvious in the book.

I personally don't think that this proves one way or another what the ultimate fate of Shireen will be in the books. It has always been known that Melisandre was out for King's blood, and that Stanis loves his daughter enough to not sacrifice her.

No, it was no where near that obvious. I cringe when the show does that because even though I really enjoy the show, I want to read it first. The show is going to bypass the books & I'm just not sure how I feel about that...

Oh I think the show made it pretty clear. Mel is going to burn Shireen. How else could you take that scene? It's only been theorized by book readers until now.

Imo no. And also, it could be a red herring as I doubt they'd just give such a major spoiler away and ruin it. It just implied Shireen is instrumental going forward.
2155	Howdyphillip	2014-05-18	Oh I think the show made it pretty clear. Mel is going to burn Shireen. How else could you take that scene? It's only been theorized by book readers until now.


I think what was made clear is that Melisandre wants to burn Shireen as part of her plan... I took the same interpretation from the books as she has kings blood. I don't think that Stanis will allow that in either book or show.
2156	The Old Tongue	2014-05-18	Â 
Imo no. And also, it could be a red herring as I doubt they'd just give such a major spoiler away and ruin it. It just implied Shireen is instrumental going forward.

She told her to look into the fire, told her about sacrificing people, told her to do what's necessary (that there are no sins in service to The Lord), and told her to bring Shireen. How is that not clear? 
Whether it happens it not remains to be seen but she definitely wants to burn her.

Well Mel said something to Selyse like you are strong enough to see the truth no matter how harsh & that the lord of light will need Shireen. With the whole power in Kings blood thing it seems pretty obvious to me. Could be a red herring though, hope it is. I think they would most definitely give away a major spoiler but I hope they didn't.
2158	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-18	Ill seriously bawl my eyes out if Shireen gets burned. Im not even joking.Â 
Â 
I did like the scene and i actually didnt notice the ruby was missing. Oh well. The scene was interesting because Selyse is both enraptured and envious of Mel. The scene with the two women was very cool and had Mel explaining her tricks. Selyse was like "i wish i was her. I wish...then Stannis would want me..." Its oddly emotional and Mel was trying to comfort Selyse in her...weird way. Mel is kinda detached from human emotions. Its a cool scene. But im so afraid for Shireen.

Yes, that's what I meant. It might be her intention, but isn't a spoiler per se as it's to be seen whether it happens or not.
2161	The Old Tongue	2014-05-18	I think what was made clear is that Melisandre wants to burn Shireen as part of her plan... I took the same interpretation from the books as she has kings blood. I don't think that Stanis will allow that in either book or show.

What if Stannis does? That could be his turning point. He's following the prophecy like its a checklist instead of forging his own path.

I haven't read them in awhile but I don't remember it being so in your face in the book. Like it was something I caught on my 2nd read or after thinking about it a bit. Here it was like Oh Mel wants to burn Shireen.
I think you are correct though: Stannis won't allow her to do it.  if  he is around to stop it. We know that there is a point where Stannis isn't around & poor Shireen is left with Crazy Mel & crazier Selyse
2163	northernmonkey	2014-05-18	Oh I think the show made it pretty clear. Mel is going to burn Shireen. How else could you take that scene? It's only been theorized by book readers until now.

2165	Dain Storm	2014-05-18	What if Stannis does? That could be his turning point. He's following the prophecy like its a checklist instead of forging his own path.

I'm not sure about that. The show kind of set up his love for Shireen as his only redeemable quality. I think it's more likely he'll go beserker if he returns to the wall and finds out his daughter has been burned.

 that's what I mean. In the books you think "Oh man what if Mel wants to burn Shireen?!" "I think Mel might end up burning Shireen" the show just made it "Mel wants to burn Shireen" 
Whether it ends up happening or not is another story.

On the contrary if Stannis actually does let Shireen get burnt then I will completely give up on show Stannis and join in on the character assasination chants on these boards.
2178	juanml82	2014-05-18	Killing her is too obvious. It's possible, of course, as the show isn't renown for subtlety. Other death option is that Shireen is the real Nissa Nissa, whom Stannis will need to kill to forge a real Lightbringer.
Â 
Or, someone else said, Melissandre saw Stannis' death and Shireen is needed as his heir. Then again, if Melissandre believes Stannis is Azor Ahai Reborn and saw his death

2180	DaveyJoe	2014-05-18	People are using book insight and assuming that the show has spoiled something.

Â 
Per the story.
Â 
AA had to drive the sword through the heart of the woman he loved most, his wife, in order to make light bringer.

However, as i think mel is following the wrong course from what the flame says, Shireen will be alright in the end.

Â It's not confirmation of anything except that she's important to the story, but it's interesting to see everybody treat this as validation for fan theories that the books haven't confirmed yet.Apparently that's pretty common around here. The "Night's King" turned a baby into an Other/White Walker. "OMG! They just spoiled TWOW!" Uh, no they didn't. They invented a scene to keep the threat of the WW present on the show. They pretty much said exactly that in the "Inside the Episode" with the showrunners. We have no idea if that's a book spoiler or not. Conspiracy theories are more fun, though.It's a bit irksome because the show's canon is intentionally different. Just because the show does something it doesn't mean it'll happen in the books. Shireen may become important in the books. Or she may not. It's entirely possible they'll be using Shireen in place of another character that hasn't been introduced on the show. Or they simply made a big deal about bringing Shireen to explain why Stannis would bring his daughter to war with him, something that doesn't need explaining in the books but might need clarifying on the show.How did that scene disprove any theories? Â I thought that scene had some very interesting lines about what seems plain and obvious is anything but.The lack of a ruby supposedly "disproves" that Melisandre is glamored all the time. But that's assuming that 1) glamors require a ruby in the show and 2) they're even going that route at all. Even if Melisandre is always glamored in the books, there's no reason they need to do that in the show at all.

I agree. Also, remember her speech to Shireen about how there is only one hell? And her speech about how none of the lambs she slaughtered ever saw the blade? Poor Shireen... I am expecting the worst and hoping for the best.

Â 
This. Selyse is one of those characters who greatly profits from having a POV in the show (I find her infinitely more fascinating than book Selyse). And the actress playing her is amazing. I love the dynamic between Selyse and Mel in the show. Absolutely gorgeous.
Â 


IÂ think you are correct though: Stannis won't allow her to do it.Â  if  he is around to stop it. We know that there is a point where Stannis isn't around & poor Shireen is left with Crazy Mel & crazier Selyse


Â 
Agreed. Stannis has made it very clear that he loves his family, even if they are nowhere near perfect (crazy wife, grey-scaled daughter). He would never burn Shireen, but it won't be his choice. Here's how I think it will go down (in broad strokes):
1) Stannis + Co. go to the Wall.
2) Stannis leaves for Winterfell.
3) pink letter
4) Mel convinces Selyse to offer Shireen to the red god.
5) Stannis reaction (will be heartbreaking)

Â 
If Shireen burns in the show, it's bound to feel like the character assassination of Mel was taken up to 11.
Â 
But it would also almost have to happen before TWOW is published. In which case, we might see it happen in the book. I wouldn't know how to feel then.
Â 
Probably come down to nuances...
2190	TheReal_Rebel	2014-05-19	Davos is also going to the Wall with Stamnis & company, does anyone really think after freeing Gendry he'd let Mel burn Shireen?
Personally, I can't believe Selyse  or Stannis would allow the sacrifice of their only child. It would likely be the very thing to make them doubt her.  As already said by others, in the books Shireen is Stannis's heir.  So there's no way they're killing her.  Much of what Stannis is doing is for her, in his mind at least.
My guess is I think this is a set up for Shireen to go with Davos to Manderly's at White Harbor and on to Skagos to look for RS in S5.

I was thinking about that. Perhaps it was nothing, just an act. She tells selyse right after that most of her potions and powders are merely tricks. 
It seems they still may go the undead route with her. Mel may have Selyse so entranced that glamours aren't necessary and that little reaction in the bath was to test/play with the control she has over her.
Exploring the theory of Mel as some sort of Other: there was a face to face shot of  Mel and selyse where Mel's face was a cold blue. Wonder if that was deliberate.
2192	The King Of Cooked Steak	2014-05-19	Remember that potion she told Selyse to bring her, and dropped it in her bath? That was probably glamour.
Â 
Also, I was surprised to hear Mel wanting to sacrifice Shireen. I didn't assume it at all in the books. I mean, I do remember Val saying something about the child being cursed by death, but nothing that Mel would do. And I don't think she would do it without Stannis' permission (unless she has seen in her fires that Stannis will die, and do it afterwards). He would certainly not allow it.
2193	Colonel Green	2014-05-19	Davos is also going to the Wall with Stamnis & company, does anyone really think after freeing Gendry he'd let Mel burn Shireen?


Davos and Stannis leave, though, at a certain point.
2194	Widows_Blood	2014-05-19	Guys I think that whole bit is about needing Shireen to crown in case Stannis bites the dust. Of course it may turn out that some kingsblood is needed to revive a certain bastard, but I don't think that is what Mel is referring to here.Â

Â 
That could be too.
Â 
I mean, I'm also worried about Shireen and probably they wanted to hint us to believe she's in danger, but then, why bothering to crown Stannis if he won't have more heirs? R'hllor won't make him immortal.
2197	HouseHarrison	2014-05-19	I was too distracted by Mel's ass to notice.

2199	King of the Road	2014-05-19	They're planning on burning Shireen I think. A sacrifice, perhaps to make Stannis immortal, or some other power that The Red God can grant him. That'll be a true test of character for Stannis, though I think they've set up his refusal for such an incident earlier this season. Perhaps he'll conspire with Jon to send Shireen with Sam and Gilly?
2200	Envie	2014-05-19	I think the show writers are really good at trolling us. Really good. They've done it before - they know the large percentage of their audience who are devout book followers - they're always pushing the limits.
Â 
Troll: "Lets make them think we're going to sacrifice Shireen but not come right out and say so, that will drive 'em crazy!"
Â 

Â 
And no, I don't think Shireen is on George's short list and not on the show's either.
2201	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-19	Yes and I said that I think in the HBO version Davos takes Shireen with him.  I think Davos persuades Stannis she is not safe with Mel & Selyse.

Selyse has her concerns about, well... Stannis and Mel laying together ... but she allows it for the greater good of Rhillor, etc.
Â 
However, some of the looks Selyse was giving naked Melisandre that Selyse is a lesbian (or bi at least), and really in enraptured in that way by Melisandre.

Â 
Stannis allowing Shireen to be burned would go far beyond character assasination. That would be full on character apocalypse -- the most absurd change from the books the show would ever have done. Can't fathom it would happen. Especially given his insistence in the dinner table scene that Selyse isn't even to strike her.
2204	SeventySeven	2014-05-19	Guys, they change stuff around, but not the main plot. They've proved it times and times again, eventually the main story always stays unaltered. Shireen will stay with Selyse and Mel once Davos and Stannis leave, and the show wants the audience to believe she might be in danger... Whether that's the case, a red herring or whether anything bad happens to Shireen or doesn't, is a different matter. But they never dramatically change plots, neither the show is its own canon.

Â 
Nah, you can look at it that way if you want to be titillated by it, but tbh it was all about Stannis. Selyse was squaring up Melisandre because Stannis wants her, and she was wondering what is that Mel has that she doesn't. That's why she immediately asks whether she used a potion on him, and is hurt when she says she did not. It was a bit of jealousy, not lesbian undertones.
2205	Petyr Patter	2014-05-19	Oh I think the show made it pretty clear. Mel is going to burn Shireen. How else could you take that scene? It's only been theorized by book readers until now.


Â 
There is another "challenging truth," Stannis dies.
Â 
And this is something that has happened in the books, or was at least reported in the books which is enough for Melisandre to misinterpret her vision.Â  At that point, Shireen becomes their Queen making her important.
Â 
On the otherhand, Melissandre had King's blood at the Wall with Mance Rayder.Â  Stannis was well prepared to burn him for his oath breaking, but Melisandre intervened and he's still alive.Â  Shireen is safe... probably.Â  I think the show runners wanted the strike some fear for her into the audience, but sacrificing her doesn't make sense: http://asoiaf.wester...ydog/?p=5066544
2206	ground_control	2014-05-19	Shireen had Greyscale, like the Stone Men.
Shireen is a true born Baratheon, and thus an unsecret Targaryen.
Â 
Thus, Shireen will be a Stone Dragon at the Wall, and Mel wants King's Blood to waken a Stone Dragon.
Â 
Not saying that Mel won't try to burn Shireen, but it would not be out of line for her to try to do that while missing the big picture.

					
					
							Edited by ground_control, 19 May 2014 - 04:42 AM.
2207	Lord Varys	2014-05-19	My guess is that Mel is just feeding Selyse shit here, to keep her quiet because Stannis wants to take his daughter with him to the Wall.
Â 
The whole point of the scene was to tell the audience that Mel uses lies and tricks as well as true magic (and truth) to do R'hllor's will, and thus it makes entirely sense for her to tell Selyse that R'hllor wants Shireen to come with them, if that's what she needs to hear to shut up.
Â 
And Mel cannot say to the audience that Dragonstone will be taken by the Lannisters after they leave, since they apparently want to keep it vague as to where they are going.
Â 
It's pretty clear that in the books Shireen cannot be sacrificed for any reason whatsoever:
Â 
1. Shireen is Stannis' heir. With Stannis supposed to be dead, his followers will have to crown Shireen or seize to continue the fight. This applies to Melisandre as well, but even more so to book Selyse, who is only important because she is the mother of Stannis' only child. By crowning Shireen, Selyse and Mel can effectively take over Stannis' followers and do whatever the hell they want (although they have no men to do all that much).
Â 
2. Shireen is Stannis' heir. If his followers or he himself would sacrifice her, it would pretty much kill his entire cause. No one follows a man who murders his own, innocent child. There way be reasons to kill traitorous brothers and sons, but not innocent children. Especially not if we are talking about the only child.
Â 
3. Shireen is Stannis' heir. Both Selyse and Melisandre will do anything in their power to keep her alive, not the other way around. If Shireen dies, then most likely because the wildlings turn against Selyse/Mel and kill her because she is 'unclean'. Or because her greyscale returns and she dies of sickness.
In fact, I expect Mel doing everything in her power to save Shireen's life should the greyscale return. We have seen what Moqorro did to save Victarion's life and arm. Mel could do something similar to save Shireen from greyscale, turning her into 'the stone beast breathing shadow fire' in the process (i.e. most likely into a hideously disfigured creature, half-burned girl, half dragon - due to her Targaryen blood).
2208	Jslay427	2014-05-19	Well we know that Selyse wouldn't object to Mel burning Shireen, but they both have to know that Stannis would crucify them both were they to.
2209	Lord Varys	2014-05-19	TV Selyse does not like her daughter. Book Selyse does like her daughter. She is the only thing she's got.
Â 
In fact, book Stannis is the one ignoring his only child. They have not once spoken to each other in any book chapter I know of, nor does Stannis seem to give any thought of preparing his daughter to rule. If she is supposed to follow him, one would expect him to have her attend him during council sessions and stuff like that. It makes sense that he does not take her with when he rides into war, but she should have been with him at Castle Black.
Â 
Even if Stannis survives his alleged death - with such an untrained successor in the charge of 'smart guys' like Axell Florent and Selyse, Stannis' cause will die soon if he does not send word to the Wall soon that he is still alive.
Â 
For Mel there can't really be a reason to sacrifice Shireen after Stannis is supposed to be that. Killing Shireen will not bring Stannis back, nor should Mel technically continue to fight for Shireen after Stannis' death since her fight is something completely different. But I'm pretty sure Mel is not going to believe that Stannis is dead, because she is convinced he is Azor Ahai. But for the people in doubt she will throw her support behind Queen Shireen since they'll have to give anyone a show who may start to doubt that Stannis is dead.
Â 
She is all about 'the trappings of power', and for that she really needs Queen Shireen.
2210	Sub_Zero94	2014-05-19	without Stannis or Jon around to defend the princess........... it does make me nervous, i'm not gonna lie Â Â 
Â 
I mean, how many Kings Men are left at Castle Black, if any ?
2211	Lord Varys	2014-05-19	Mel should see to it that Selyse and Shireen remain unharmed. That black powder that can kill a man instantly was not mentioned to be never heard of again, I assume. Mel should make short work out of Bowen Marsh and his cabal. And Tormund and his wildlings should not really want to kill Shireen. Wildlings may not let greyscale children live, but they are south of the Wall now. They will wait and see what happens. But if Shireen gets sick again, things may get ugly...
2212	Bronn Urgundy	2014-05-19	TV Selyse does not like her daughter. Book Selyse does like her daughter. She is the only thing she's got.
Â 
In fact, book Stannis is the one ignoring his only child. They have not once spoken to each other in any book chapter I know of, nor does Stannis seem to give any thought of preparing his daughter to rule. If she is supposed to follow him, one would expect him to have her attend him during council sessions and stuff like that. It makes sense that he does not take her with when he rides into war, but she should have been with him at Castle Black.
Â 
Even if Stannis survives his alleged death - with such an untrained successor in the charge of 'smart guys' like Axell Florent and Selyse, Stannis' cause will die soon if he does not send word to the Wall soon that he is still alive.
Â 
For Mel there can't really be a reason to sacrifice Shireen after Stannis is supposed to be that. Killing Shireen will not bring Stannis back, nor should Mel technically continue to fight for Shireen after Stannis' death since her fight is something completely different. But I'm pretty sure Mel is not going to believe that Stannis is dead, because she is convinced he is Azor Ahai. But for the people in doubt she will throw her support behind Queen Shireen since they'll have to give anyone a show who may start to doubt that Stannis is dead.
Â 
She is all about 'the trappings of power', and for that she really needs Queen Shireen.


Â 
To be fair book Stannis barely actually appears and is more of a mentioned looming shadow in the background of even quite a lot of Davos' chapters, its only later at the Wall (where he keeps his child in a safer place on the Wall) does he appear more frequently. Shireen is getting a proper noble borns education however, Stannis might just think she's a bit young for the kind of council meetings that discuss whether they should sacrifice her cousin for the greater good or not.
2213	OnlyOne	2014-05-19	Â 
Yes, that's what I meant. It might be her intention, but isn't a spoiler per se as it's to be seen whether it happens or not.

Mel isn't going to get everything she wants...
2214	Morbanth	2014-05-19	I see two possibilities:
Â 
1) Melisandre saw Loras Tyrell taking Dragonstone in her fires. She knows it is important to take the heir with them.
Â 
or
Â 
2) Melisandre saw that she needs to sacrifice Shireen, perhaps to revive a certain bastard, as others have pointed out. She does this after realizing the reason Rhollor keeps showing her Snow when she asks to see Azor Ahai. Melisandre burns Shireen and revives Jon because she believes she was wrong about Stannis and thinks him dead. Stannis comes back, loses his mind over what they did to his daughter, and kills Melisandre with the fake Lightbringer... turning it into the real thing through the sacrifice of his "beloved", Shireen, but indirectly.

2215	Bear Island	2014-05-19	It's hard to know what to make of the scene but it can't be called a spoiler.
Maybe Mel just meant Shireen is important and is needed as Stannis' heir but the talk about sacrifice and nothing being a sin if it's in service of god sure makes it SEEM like Mel is intending on burning her. The thing is, as everyone has mentioned, Stannis would never allow that. Maybe it happens behind his back, but I can't see him ever allowing it or being okay with it if it were done behind his back.
I agree with SeventySeven. That scene, to me, felt like Selyse was sizing up Mel, and was jealous/envious of the qualities Mel possesses that Stannis apparently finds attractive. I didn't for a minute see any desire there.
2216	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-19	Are there any stills of Mel naked in this scene? For... Research obviously

2219	Morbanth	2014-05-19	She's Dutch, I think she's naked in every movie I've seen her in. Just google it my friend.
2220	Gendels Children	2014-05-19	IMO the whole "we need to keep your daughter with us because she is important for the future" thing is quite vague, yet... unsettling-ly clear that she wishes to burn her.that is why it wont happen. unsullied and book readers alike can easily pick up on the idea of burning her for her kings blood in order to serve some higher purpose. which is exactly why i think it wont happen, its too obvious, and right now D&D are getting into a subject that has not been dictated clearly by the books yet, its in essences a project all their own, they are going to want to do this the best way possible (though i know not everyone will/has agreed with their methods) i think they are really going to try avoid 'spoilers' or overly clear hints unless they are leading you into the wrong direction. i think this little statement about about Shireens upcoming necessary role she has to play will have more to do with (like others have said) her greyscale. its built up rather big in the 5th book, the wildlings know a lot about greyscale and they know to steer clear of anyone inflicted with it, they distrust and fear it to the point of killing children who have been cursed with it. i very much doubt this has just been brought to our(and jons) attention at such a crucial time for no reason at all. that being said ANYTHING can just be a great big red herring in this particular realm.Â
2221	Damon_Tor	2014-05-19	She told her to look into the fire, told her about sacrificing people, told her to do what's necessary (that there are no sins in service to The Lord), and told her to bring Shireen. How is that not clear?
Whether it happens it not remains to be seen but she definitely wants to burn her.


The "sin" might be totally different.Â  Maybe she's going to use Shireen's womb to breed more shadow monsters.
2222	Rooseman	2014-05-19	It's all vague enaugh and as long as it hasn't happened, anybody can interpret it as they like.
Â 
I've long been buying into the theory that she will be sacrificed. It's just a very fitting thing to happen both in the universe itself, as well as from a storytelling perspective. So when Selyse started talking about wether they would leave Shireen behind or not, I immediately knew where this was going. For me, this only further strengthens the theory, I find that the scene was even a bit on-the-nose if you already suspected something like this happening in the future.Â 
Â 
But again, if you're opposed to the theory, it's not difficult to find reasons why it might all happen differently.
2223	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-19	The whole "no matter how harsh it seems" and "the Lord needs her"Â does NOT sound like they are takingÂ her because she is the heir.

True, but he could have Shireen present during his meetings with Jon, though. She's about 10-11 years old by then. While she shouldn't intervene, listening could be good teaching.
2225	Batbob45	2014-05-19	Shireen might get burn because Mel is afraid thatÂ  Shireen is the one that convinced Stannis to turn his back on Mel.
2226	#Fire and Blood	2014-05-19	I think it is folly to not think that something negative is/was going to happen to Shireen all along.Â  I do not think it will be as simple as a sacrifice though.Â  In the books *Sorry!*

	Spoiler Shireen has a dream (I think more than once) that a dragon eats her. Something about the stone dragon prophecy at the wall, Shireen's greyscale, Shireens Targ blood that gives her dragon dreams, and the fact that her dragon dreams are not happy (not that they usually are) means to me that something negative will definitely happen to Shireen. Will it be as obvious as sacrificing her to a fire? No, nothing is ever that obvious in these books. 

Â 
Stannis certainly would not permit her to be sacrificed, but even before show Selyse came out, I always thought her commitment to the Red God would overtake her sense of family.Â  It was given to us a reminder when she burned her brother.Â  Whats to stop her from "sacrificing" her daughter in some way for the Red God?
2227	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-19	Â

 I shouldn't have said Mel is going to burn Shireen. I think the show made it pretty clear Mel  wants  to burn Shireen. I honestly hope she doesn't get her wish but I don't see what is going to stop her.
2229	Envie	2014-05-19	Guys, they change stuff around, but not the main plot. They've proved it times and times again, eventually the main story always stays unaltered. Shireen will stay with Selyse and Mel once Davos and Stannis leave, and the show wants the audience to believe she might be in danger... Whether that's the case, a red herring or whether anything bad happens to Shireen or doesn't, is a different matter. But they never dramatically change plots, neither the show is its own canon.
Â 
Â 
Nah, you can look at it that way if you want to be titillated by it, but tbh it was all about Stannis. Selyse was squaring up Melisandre because Stannis wants her, and she was wondering what is that Mel has that she doesn't. That's why she immediately asks whether she used a potion on him, and is hurt when she says she did not. It was a bit of jealousy, not lesbian undertones.


Â 
Good post.Â 
Â 
I'm not sure where the whole lesbian/bi suggestive thing came into the scene - that's somewhat crude assessment by some in any case considering how subtle the actors both were about it. Perhaps one needs to be a sexually open female to have understood that moment between the two women. 
Â 
Though I can see the sexual undertones to the scene (obvious distraction of her nudity and oozing sexuality in the bath) - the reactions by Selyse were definitely mixed between jealousy and fear / respect for Melisandre's powers - whether those powers are just trickery and sexuality or actual real magic ... which Mel explained she uses a little of both.
2230	Hanzo Hasashi	2014-05-19	I think what was made clear is that Melisandre wants to burn Shireen as part of her plan... I took the same interpretation from the books as she has kings blood. I don't think that Stanis will allow that in either book or show.


Â 
I agree, but given how crazy he Selyse is Shireen could very well be sacrificed without his permission- which could possibly serve as a breaking point for Stannis.Â 
Â 
Just sayin'

I don't deny that 'they mean her harm', but Mel will not get everything she wants. Not from Stannis.
2232	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-05-19	I don't deny that 'they mean her harm', but Mel will not get everything she wants. Not from Stannis.
How will he stop her though? 
The show made 2 things very clear:
1. Mel means Shireen harm
2. Selyse will go along with Mel 
We know Stannis will leave the wall. Shireen will be left with Mel & Selyse (unless the show changes this) They've also received a letter saying Stannis is dead. If Mel believes this there is no reason for her to fear repercussions from Stan when he returns. She won't care that Shireen is Stannis' heir other than what burning her king's blood will do. Why would she? All Mel is concerned with is AAR. If Stan is dead (in Mel's mind) he isn't it.
ETA: at least that's how they make it seem. It most definitely could be a red herring. But with the foreshadowing in the book I don't think so.

I'm not really clear on what happened in this scene. It seems like Mel was seducing Selyse in a way. Selyse was definitely feeling some suppressed attraction, she tried to avert her eyes but she couldn't look away and Mel was trying to work it without being obvious about it or offending her. Clearly Mel wants Shireen to come North, she gave Selyse her explanation and Selyse seems to have taken it at face value but I don't think that we should or assume that it means Mel intends to burn Shireen. Frankly I think Mel wants to get rid of Selyse and that Shireen will be the wedge she uses to accomplish this.Â

I didn't feel any sexual tension I felt like Selyse was feeling jealousy. 
Yes, Mel could be lying to Selyse & the truth could be any number of things but IMO it was made extremely clear that Mel is telling Selyse she intends to burn Shireen. I just don't see any other way to take it.

I took it to mean that Shireen is going to be important and that the lord of light needs her for for something.

She tells Selyse to look into the fire, that she is strong enough to see the truth no matter how harsh it may be, tells her about sacrificing people, that there are no sins to the lord of light or something like that, that they have to take Shireen with them because the lord of light will have need of her. What exactly do you think her importance could be other than burning her? I'm not being sarcastic, I'm willing to listen with an open mind if someone can give me an explanation that fits.

Â 
Well, if everything on that shelf had to do with mind alterations, then maybe Mel's appearance is a glamor and Auntie Mel's special bath salts are how she does it?
Â 


Personally, I can't believe Selyse or Stannis would allow the sacrifice of their only child. It would likely be the very thing to make them doubt her. As already said by others, in the books Shireen is Stannis's heir. So there's no way they're killing her. Much of what Stannis is doing is for her, in his mind at least.


Â 
On Stannis I agree, but I'm not so sure about Selyse (at least show Selyse). She has made it perfectly clear, that she is ashamed of / angry with Shireen, because of her greyscale. She may love her, still, but definitely not as much as Stannis.

There's literally endless reasons why she could be important other than being burnt.

Agreed. To me it seems like the obvious thing. I reckon her greyscale is more likely to be what it is. We've already established that the wildlings dont like it, Val doesnt think its completely gone, and wildlings superstitions often turn out to be the actual truth. Either the greyscale will return and spread from person to person, or it will play a role in antagonising the wildlings against the southerners. Or as you said, it could be anything else, we just dont know, its too vague, to say 'this character has a role to play' in the show isnt saying much, as D & D usually only keep a character if they have a role to play, so obvious she is going to have an important part to play later on

The thing I'm not even clear on is if Mel was manipulating what Selyse saw in the flames or if Selyse saw anything at all and just went along with it because she didn't want Mel to think she was a heathen.

It has something to do with the grey scale, as others have mentioned.

and the king's blood must come from daughter now that gendry is gone....of course she has to go to the wall....

Oh, I know.

I was referring to this >

LOL, what Rubies? Shirr-who?
Â 
I must confess that during the whole scene the only thing I could think of was that Melisandre (not Dany) is the most beautiful woman in Planetos.
2258	Mad Monkey	2014-05-19	The thing I'm not even clear on is if Mel was manipulating what Selyse saw in the flames or if Selyse saw anything at all and just went along with it because she didn't want Mel to think she was a heathen. Anyways it could just be that Mel didn't want Shireen staying because Dragonstone might be in peril of being taken, as it is in the books and it would be a bad place to leave Stannis's heir.Melisandre: "Can you see the truth of R'hllor in the flames? Look!"Selyse (thinking): I can feel her nipples through her robes!Melisandre: "Only someone with your strength can see true visions from our Lord."Selyse (thinking): She's not even touching me. How is that even possible?!?Melisandre: "Your Grace?"Selyse: "Erm... ah... yes, I see it now... totally, whatever you said is cool. R'hllor be praised, hallelujah!"

2259	Starry	2014-05-20	But Mel doesn't want to set Stannis or his heir on the Iron Throne. She wants to fight the others. And therefor she needs Azor Ahai. If she knew that Stannis would die, why should she take Shireen with her to replace him. She can't think that Shireen will replace Stannis as Azor Ahai. So there must be an onther reason.
Â 
I don't think that she wants to spread Greyscale at the wall. Who shall fight the Others then?
2260	Lord Varys	2014-05-20	I've already said it, that scene could just be in there to explain why/that Selyse and Shireen - who did not leave Dragonstone before, when Stannis fought his battles - will now accompany him. If Mel had said something like 'Dragonstone will soon fall after we have left' or 'Stannis fears that Shireen might end up in the hands of the Lannisters if she remains on the island' then the audience would know that Stannis is not going to try to attack the Lannisters. They gave the impression that this is his plan now, after he has learned that Joffrey was killed.
Â 
It's actually very likely that Mel has just told Selyse what she wanted to hear - or rather, made her accept a fact (that Shireen will come with them) by saying her what she needed to her: That R'hllor had a plan for Shireen, and that this was the reason why she is accompanying them. When in fact Stannis may just have decided that his daughter and heir will come with him, because he does not expect to return to Dragonstone at all/in the foreseeable future. It would actually be completely stupid to leave her there, but again - they could not mention that in the show, if they intended to keep the illusion alive, that they were fighting the Lannisters.
Â 
We know get the ominous feeling that Shireen may be used as sacrifice to do whatever Melisandre intended to do with Gendry to win Stannis' throne. But that really is not the case.
Â 
I'm pretty sure they are not foreshadowing anything from TWoW in the show here, nor is it very likely that the Selyse loathing her daughter is going to lead to anything. They seem to be using that thing - among others - to explain why Stannis grew estranged from his wife (he seemed to have cared for Selyse once, during the Siege of Storm's End), but in the books Selyse really loves and cares for her daughter. She will not allow that she as sacrificed. This thought does also never cross Melisandre's mind in her chapter - in fact, she is actually a much nicer person in her POV than people have imagined. She respects Davos and tries to protect his son Devan. I really don't see her trying to kill Stannis' only child.
2261	Tixu Oty	2014-05-20	I thought that conversation about Shireen was very interesting. I don't think it proves or disproves anything yet.
Â 
Even though it sounds a lot like bad things might happen to Shireen, the whole conversation is vague enough that a doubt remains on Mel's intentions. But if she's truly implying that she wants to burn Shireen, I don't think that's really more in your face than it was in the books. us bookreaders thought that because Mel and all the characters around her were always talking/thinking about power in King's blood and the fact that she's pretty much always looking to wake the stone dragon and all... Shireen has king's blood, we connected the dots. Same in the show. Viewers heard Mel say there was power in King's blood only once and they know she wanted to sacrifice Gendry. Then Mel has this ominous talk about Shireen. I think only the attentive viewers will connect the dots for now. To them it might sound like: omg, Davos saved Gendry and now Mel will to kill his little buddy instead! Which it could very well be in the show.
Â 
And even if Mel's intentions ARE to burn Shireen somewhere down the line (I got no sense of urgency there btw) viewers know Mel is a little out there and readers know she's at least partially wrong about stuff all the time. I think it won't end up as she expects.
Â 
I just took this scene as a set-up that yes, Shireen will be important, at least in the show, which is great news for us because we've been wondering about Shireen's potential importance all along. Yay!
Â 
I didn't even notice that the ruby was missing, duh! Good job OP! I wonder if it might mean anything for the books but I'm going to go out on a limb and say it doesn't. It's probably just the show toning down the magic as usual.

2262	The Dragon has three heads	2014-05-20	Oh I think the show made it pretty clear. Mel is going to burn Shireen. How else could you take that scene? It's only been theorized by book readers until now.

No, she said "The Lord has need of her". That's not a jump either way.
2263	SeventySeven	2014-05-20	Â 
She was sacrificed which is why Clytemnestra hates Agammenon still, all those years later. Â Supposedly, by the end, Iphigenia talks herself into becoming a willing sacrifice, but sacrificed she was.


Â 
She isn't sacrificed in the end. I did it in high school, and I specifically remember she's not sacrificed and she's replaced with some animal instead, and becomes a priestess of some kind. Check it out.

I agree with your post and it's likely they weren't foreshadowing or using spoilers really, but I do think it's setting up the dynamic between Mel/Selyse/Shireen and it implies Shireen has a bigger role to play.

BIB: that's how I took it as well. And again, they want the audience to think Shireen might be in some sort of danger but whether it happens and how it's all to be seen.
2264	Lord Varys	2014-05-20	If they are smart, we'll see Stannis showing up with Shireen as his official heir at the Wall. She could be an interesting companion for Jon in season 5, especially after Stannis starts his campaign, providing Jon with information about Mel and her faith. Especially if Val is not going to be in the show - which seems to be the case.
Â 
I guess Stannis will take his whole family - Shireen, Selyse, Melisandre, and Davos - to Castle Black, from where Davos and Salla will then eventually leave for White Harbor (most likely at the very beginning of season 5).
Â 
But I must say I find the show's interpretation of Selyse really stupid. She seems to such a timid and insecure person, whereas the real Selyse is actually haughty and domineering, while being a subservient follower of Melisandre. Show Selyse is much more like Alannys Greyjoy - hanging around in a tower, ignoring everything around her - than book Selyse.
Â 
And hating her only child doesn't make a lot of sense, anyway, especially since Stannis no longer sleeps with her. She has one child, and Shireen is her only chance to remain an important person in her husband's life. If Shireen would die - or Selyse arrange her death - Stannis would more or less be free to set his marriage aside and marry anew (Mel, for instance). Thus it's extremely irrational - even politically suicidal - for Selyse to act against her daughter.
2265	Mordos_Kull	2014-05-20	Did anyone catch Carice's interview the other day?
Â 
When asked about her relationship to Shireen, she said she believed that Mel see's Shireen as a threat, as she doesn't embrace her religion.
Â 
It seems more of a personal vendetta than a prophecy.

2269	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-20	Didn't like the missing ruby but was interesting to explore the Selyse and Mel dynamic, and I liked the hints at tricks and Mel's little alchemy get up.

She's also a bit crazy.  They are showing her vulnerable side (which she would invariably have after so many miscarriages).  I would say that she was so broken by them and her daughter's condition that she has become evangelical in her beliefs and completely irrational.
She has no reason to be haughty around a woman she worships nearly as much as her god, but I think they've done a great job of showing why she is the way she is.
2271	missingm	2014-05-20	First of all, a major goof by depicting Mel without her ruby. I'm wondering if this was an oversight by the director or if mayhaps the producers are of the knowledge that the ruby is a trick like those at her shelf.
I'm also a little ticked off at how blatant the show is at suggesting the fate of Stannis' daughter. I don't remember it being so obvious in the book.


Â 
Thank you for giving me an excuse to go back and watch that seen (for the ruby).Â  
Â 
As for Shireen, Mel may try to burn her, but could she survive it? She does have the whole dragon scale thing going on. I can picture her stepping out of the flames like Dany.Â
2272	sj4iy	2014-05-20	I personally don't see how it's a 'goof' when we don't really know for sure that she has any kind of glamour on herself at all.  People have guesses, but those are disproved all the time.

2274	Mrs.Grumpy	2014-05-20	It's clear that Melisandre is wearing a glamor.
For a glamor, as far as we know the one needs a ruby or a moonstone. -Melisandre always wear that hugeass ruby. (Personally, I believe that her ruby is multipurpose, it also protects her from poison)
Glamor radiates heat, sometimes it burns. -Melisandre radiates heat, even so she can melt the snow.
She looks young but she said in her PoV that she practiced magic "years beyond count".

Â 
She's jealous of Shireen and the psuedo-affection that Stannis gives to her. Â Selyse clearly loves Stannis but it's unrequited. Â Stannis tolerates Selyse but loves Shireen, in his Stannis sort of way.
2276	moraga1	2014-05-20	No one is going to "sacrifice" Shireen. I am amazed how people of little minds get all caught up in the latest "small talk." Â You are talking about someone much more powerful than all around her (including the Red Priestess Melisandre). Â The first Ruling Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Lady of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm will be Princess Shireen Baratheon - First of her Name. Â Bank it.
2277	The Old Tongue	2014-05-20	Interesting idea...I saw a similar post atÂ http://asoiaf.wester...-4#entry5799850
If that theory has anything to do with Shireen it'll be Mel sacrificing her to The Lord to resurrect a certain Stark family member.

Actors aren't always clued into where a series is going. Directors will often suggest motivation to get a certain approach to a character but that doesn't necessarily mean an actor knows the true intention of his or her characters. They're not authorities of the material. Watch Talking Dead and you'll know what I mean.
2282	The Old Tongue	2014-05-20	^^ Agree to this
If it was unintentional then it's a good. That necklace is never off her body in the books and GRRM makes the reader very aware I it in almost all her scenes.
If it was intentional to leave the ruby off, then it's significance may not be that proposed by certain readers who adhere to certain theories about the character. If the necklace isn't important then that is a spoiler.

Â 
i was thinking the same thing...D&D have had several conversations with GRRM about where he wants to take several important characters....very unlikely that Mel wouldn't have come up and if the ruby was extremely significant to her character or the main plot, D&D wouldn't have made such a silly mistake...
Â 
its likely one of those things where GRRM was just toying with us, making us think that her necklace is something magical/mystical about her abilities like the whole poison not working on her from ACoK until you find out that she regularly carries around antidotes in her nifty kit
2285	TheReal_Rebel	2014-05-20	The fact that we are all worried about Shireen's fate obviously is why the scriptwriter (B.Cogman?) planted it there.  In episode 9, (I'm guessing), we should see Stannis's rescue of the NW.  In ep. 10 we should see how things stand. We know Davos is sent to Manderlay's court by Stannis and that's when I think things become clear to Davos as to Mel's intent towards Shireen.  It may also become clear to Stannis. 
Re: Shireen being eaten by Dragons dream.  It might or might not be literal,  but I'm betting it's not. Why?  There's no evidence yet to support it will happen. Also I don't think it was mentioned by Shireen in the series.
In terms of just good television, Shireen & Davos are great characters together and compliment each other in filling in knowledge the other doesn't have. I think D&D want to keep that dynamic.
I could see Manderlay wanting to keep Shireen safe and offering to harbor her (sorry) but I think Shireen would want to stay with Davos and would escape to join him enroute to Skagos.

  I shouldn't have said Mel is going to burn Shireen. I think the show made it pretty clear Mel  wants  to burn Shireen. I honestly hope she doesn't get her wish but I don't see what is going to stop her.


maybe the scene from a couple weeks ago where stannis tells his wife not to punish her is some kind of foreshadowing... hopefully, but who knows
2287	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-20	i just rewatched the scene...Mel is DEFINITELY planning on burning Shireen and wants Selyse's help to convince Stannis...that much is overtly clear from the ep...if she has some hidden agenda, which could very well be given how shady she is...then it will be made clear later...
Â 
for now, its clear we are meant to think Mel planning on killing Shireen and wants Selyses help convincing Stannis
2288	ServantOnIce	2014-05-20	Â 
Unfortunately it feels like the burning of Shireen is imminent now. I hope that I'm wrong but now I'm actually expecting it rather than simply thinking there is an outside possibility.Â

2296	FNF	2014-05-22	Maybe it suggests that Shireen is actually Azor Ahai?
2297	Stannisneverlikedcats	2014-05-22	What if mel's reasoning was the opposite of what people suspect? What if she's actually concerned about Shireen's safety and brings her along because she knew Dragonstone would eventually fall to the Tyrells. Them taking his daughter as a hostage would distract Stannis from his mission in the north, wouldn't it? I don't see any of team Stannis returning to Dragonstone in the future books at this point, and maybe mel knows it.

Many readers remain incapable of shaking their first impression of her even after having read that chapter. Her concern for the safety of Davos' son, for example, is conceived in some quarters as an elaborate form of blackmail.Â

Oh well  Crackpots gotta crackpot.
2311	Lord Varys	2014-05-27	As anyone already suggested that Stannis may offer Shireen as wife to Jon Snow when he offers him to legitimize him as Jon Stark? In the book, he offers him to take Val as wife. She does not seem to be in the show, at least not this season, so Stannis' offer could be to legitimize Jon as Lord Stark and making him Prince Consort to his daughter and heir...
2312	SmartiesCereal	2014-05-28	I just wanted to chime in about something I noticed the show never fully mentions the need for "king's blood" without Melisande correcting Stannis with "your blood". (if it does please correct me) Â But I started thinking about that and now have this lingering notion that since there probably won't be any mention of Mance's son that it will switch to Sam and Gilly take Shireen with them? Perhaps that is out there, but is it impossible that D&D would make that change? Especially since they added the Melisandre bath scene to push for Shireen being taken to the wall.

2313	NoOneDire	2014-05-28	I don't know why but I think Mel is pulling a bait and switch with Shireen and Selyese. Mel knowsÂ Selyese is a crazy lady and it would be nice if Stanis had the option of re-marring a new house to help rebuild his kingdom. They seem to like marriage packs.Â Shireen could use aÂ kind mother that wont let her burnÂ and Stanis does love his daughter, I don't think he could burn her.Â  Far fetched but maybe.
Â 
Is Shireen the last of the Bratheons, other then Roberts bastards?

Is Shireen the last of the Bratheons, other then Roberts bastards?


Yes. If she dies, House Baratheon dies with her.
Â 
Well, Stannis could have other legitimate children, but I doubt he would.
2315	Talking Hodor	2014-06-04	Oh yeah, Melisandre is out for Shireen's heathen blood.Â  I, uh, didn't notice the missing ruby.Â  Must have been looking elsewhere the entire time.
2316	Talking Hodor	2014-06-04	Yes. If she dies, House Baratheon dies with her.
Â 
Well, Stannis could have other legitimate children, but I doubt he would.


He's a king. He could legitimize any number of "Baratheons."
2317	juanml82	2014-06-04	He's a king. He could legitimize any number of "Baratheons."


Ah, but if he legitimizes any of Robert's bastards and that bastard gets support independently of Stannis, that bastard will say his claim, as of Robert Baratheon, surpasses Stannis' claim as brother of Robert Baratheon.
2318	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-05-18	Arya showed what appeared to be genuine compassion towards Clegane this episode. It doesn't fit with her leaving him to die soon, instead of giving him a clean death. How do you think they will have this play out? Will he wrong her in some way again?
2319	north of the wall	2014-05-19	I kind of got the impression while reading that her "hating"him was an excuse she told herself for not giving him mercy but I felt as if the real reason was because she didn't want to actually lose another person she had grown close too. Just what I thought but I got have been making that up for myself because I like him. So not really sure

Â 
It's all part of the 'mockingbird' theme that played out between a lot of the characters this episode. Everyone was playing a 'part' despite their true feelings.
Â 
Arya has compassion as much as Sandor Clegane himself does - it's just buried under layers and layers of resentment and bitter desire for revenge.
2321	Kingpin	2014-05-19	Maybe Sandor will "force her" to do it, by reminding her what he did in the past and why is his name on her list. Â 
Â 
Because he doesn't want her pity and wants to die alone maybe.
2322	Zorn Gottes	2014-05-19	I hope so much they will hear the news about Sansa's marriage to the Imp before Sandor "dies"

He won't really die? That's great!
2324	A Man Is A Man	2014-05-19	Â I think the scene in this episode where The Hound does a mercy killing of that old wounded guy is a precursor for how they are going to handle the end of the Arya-Hound relationship. Yeah, in the books she just leaves him to die from his wounds but given that they seem closer in the tv show and the fact that she was helping him with his wounds in this episode, I think we are going to see Arya mercy-kill The Hound rather than walk away from him and leave him to die in anguish.
Â 
Â That's just my 2 cents.

She helps him with his wounds in the books too 
In the end their relationship was sort of "caring" in the books too, and she left him out of her list...
Â 
I agree with this:
Â 
I kind of got the impression while reading that her "hating"him was an excuse she told herself for not giving him mercy but I felt as if the real reason was because she didn't wan
Â 

she didn't want him to die
2326	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-19	I really, really love that they've expanded on their relationship in the show. Their scene where Sandor actually tells his story to Arya, then allows her to treat his wound, was so sweet. It's not just a grudging mutual respect anymore, there's a definite amount of empathy and sympathy there underneath all the "armour".
Â 
As mentioned, this mercy kill is definitely setting up for their parting. I think The Hound will tell Arya to kill him just like in the book, but she'll refuse because she wants him to live rather than out of spite. I think she'll treat his wound, and leave him out of frustration because he wants to roll over and die - and hopes that her goading will make him get up and follow her.
Â 
It'll be interesting, regardless.
2327	Roose Seal	2014-05-19	I think they're purposefully misleading the viewer to believe Arya will give the Hound the gift of mercy but they will have a spat and she will live him to die, for her own very complicated reasons.

My most lingering thought about their scenes was Biter's surprise cameo. And then there was Rorge...

2329	Chebyshov	2014-05-19	That would be just grand.

Â 
Agreed! I thought they'd pop in on Brienne and Pod, because Gwendoline Christie talked about how Brienne bites off someone's ear this episode. Who would even be left for her to do that to? No Bloody Mummers in the show, and now Biter and Rorge are dead.
2330	Mos	2014-05-19	Exactly! Who's gonna attack Brienne and Pod now? I guess it could be just a random group of bandits or something like that. If it wasn't for Gwendoline talking about biting someone's ear off, I would have suspected them just stumbling up on the Brotherhood.Â
2331	ache	2014-05-19	Any chance it could be Sandor? He did lose what was left of his ear in the books and after his talk about the Lannisters having a bounty on his head, I wonder if he will run into Brienne. With her looking for him, Arya and Sansa and her being a Lannister associate attended by Tyrions squire, I could see things getting ugly quickly if they did meet. I Â hope it doesn't happen that way, but the show does throw characters together who never met in the books.
2332	Bear Island	2014-05-19	The Hound-Arya relationship is so sweet and touching in the show. I can't see Arya giving him the gift of mercy because I firmly believe that Sandor is the Novice/Gravedigger. She'll leave him to die, but I don't know how it will play out.
To be honest, even if she killed him on the show I'd still believe in the Novice/Gravedigger theory. In the books he might play a minor part they decide to cut out because it's not important enough for the show, so he could die on the show but live in the books. I do not want to believe he's dead.
2333	yushkevitch	2014-05-19	I never liked Sandor's fate in the books or how the relationship between him and Arya ended. It seemed .. weak and almost lazy? For such a strong character he deserved something more powerful and/or dramatic.
Â 
In any case I have a feeling the writers feel the same way and this duo won't follow the same path as in the books. Not sure what they'll do but her leaving him to die isn't going to cut it.
2334	Mos	2014-05-19	If they wanna end the show after 7 season, they will need to cut some stuff out. And if The Hound doesn't play a big part in TWoW and ADoS, I could see them kill him off now instead of having him become the gravedigger. Brienne is likely to meet Lady Stoneheart this season, so she won't stumble upon the gravedigger either. Right now, I feel that there is a strong possibility we'll be seeing the last of The Hound this season.Â
2335	aussiegirl	2014-05-19	I wasn't really moved by the Hound's story about his brother. McCann played it well enough although personally I think Maisie was more effective in that scene, but I just thought 'So What!'.
Â 
I mean this is the show of hard luck stories. Maybe if he was having this conversation with a Bronn or someone, but to have it with a girl who has lost pretty much everything just felt like he was trying to one up her pain, a pain he has never once on the show acknowledged she even has.
Â 
If he honestly thinks a sword is a fair replacement for everything she lost, then Biter must have accidentally swallowed his brain when he bit him.
Â 
That said, I enjoyed the rest of the Arya/Hound scenes and I'm really not sure where they are going to leave them.
2336	Faceless Man Friday	2014-05-19	I kind of got the impression while reading that her "hating"him was an excuse she told herself for not giving him mercy but I felt as if the real reason was because she didn't want to actually lose another person she had grown close too.

I don't think it was about how much pain they've suffered, it was more like 'at least you had family who loved you'
2338	Tyrion_is_Omar	2014-05-19	I thought the same: that Arya will continueÂ crossing outÂ  names of her list. The bit will become infected and she will do a mercy killing. There was a rumour that a character that didn't die on the books would die this season, but that rumour is said every season.Â 
But, the hound dead would help them to reduce the excess of characters and he hasn't got a clear storyline in the books after Arya's kidnnaping either. So, he could be killed. Unless that in TWOW saves the day.Â

Â 
Well D&D went through the details of where every character ends up; if they think they won't need The Hound moving forward, I'm sure there's a reason for that. Still, my money's on Grenn. I think we need Arya refusing to administer the gift.
2340	Prince of the North	2014-05-19	I think the show will have Sandor's and Arya's parting be exactly the same as in the book.Â  Remember, even though they seemed to be getting along quite well this episode, in the book Sandor is angry/regretful about Sansa's marrying Tyrion, drunk, with an infected wound and, thus, says the most vile hurtful things to Arya to try to get her to give him the gift of mercy.Â  I think that would still work fine for the show.Â 
Â 
I always gotÂ the impression while reading that scene in the book that Arya knew he was trying to manipulate her into killing him so that's at least part of why she didn't do it.Â
2341	Tytus	2014-05-19	Exactly! Who's gonna attack Brienne and Pod now? I guess it could be just a random group of bandits or something like that. If it wasn't for Gwendoline talking about biting someone's ear off, I would have suspected them just stumbling up on the Brotherhood.Â 
Is Biter dead? I assumed Sandor broke his neck but the attack happened so quickly I couldn't tell for sure.

Â 
Yes, I got the same impression from the book reading - but perhaps I need to re-read it (I've been saying that a lot these past two weeks of episodes). I took it that Arya could have given him the gift of mercy and he was on her 'list' but because it was a greater insult and payback NOT to put him out of his misery she did that - to show how far down the 'don't give any fucks' path she's heading towards.
2343	idler	2014-05-19	Arya is obviously trying to kill The Hound right now. We all know of her poor sewing...
2344	'96Buck	2014-05-19	If they wanna end the show after 7 season, they will need to cut some stuff out.

I think you're right re: no gravedigger, or Crackclaw point or Hyle Hunt.Â  Notice Brienne is at the Inn at the Crossroads already, on the Kingsroad.Â  Not out in the east for Duskendale/Maidenpool/Quiet Isle.Â  She's in Frey territory already.Â  2 episodes to get caught by the BwB, then the reveal in 10.
Â 
Have to get Jaime out of King's Landing for a very abbreviated version of his "sorting things out" in the Riverlands so he's in the right place to meet Brienne again next season.
2345	'96Buck	2014-05-19	Is Biter dead? I assumed Sandor broke his neck but the attack happened so quickly I couldn't tell for sure.


yeah, he's dead.

We already don't have Rorge and Biter sacking saltpans wearing the Hound helmet, and it's been de-emphasized.Â  We don't appear to have Brienne near the Quiet Isle to see the gravedigger.Â  Whether Arya grants mercy or not, its pointing to the end of the Hound, and this season IMO.

Â 
I always thought they'd re-arrange Brienne's story line and have SH this year and then the QI/other events in S5 but I completely forgot about the Rorge taking the Hound's helmet and sacking Saltpans thing. The lack of that certainly points to the Hound 100% dying this year. I don't want that 
Â 
I really don't want that
2348	Newstar	2014-05-19	Mmm. I realized that the Saltpans atrocity seems to have been eliminated by Biter, er, biting it. Brienne also seems to be zipping through her AFFC arc. If the speculation that Brienne meets Lady Stoneheart in 4x10 is correct, and if Arya gets on a ship to Braavos in 4x10, then that pretty much leaves the Quiet Isle out. Doesn't mean that Sandor can't survive, but it makes me wonder.
On another note, I've bagged on Rory McCann's acting before, but I really liked his little speech in this episode. Nicely done.

I don't see us seeing the QI either way, but that doesn't mean that Sandor's death could be ambiguous. Maybe Brienne (post-LS on her way to Jaime or something) will find his helmet in a "grave," because it's not like Biter will need it? So she'll assume he's dead (as she does in the books) and then we're saved a good 10 minutes of QI screen-time, which did very little for Brienne's plot.
Â 
Just a thought. I don't see them completely offing The Hound, but they also like to thin out the cast where possible.

Well he did tell her all the horrible things he did and thought about doing before she left him to die. Like how he should have "raped her sister bloody" or something like that. I don't think that will be in the show but a quick Mycha reminder should do the trick.Â

Arya is the POV character, so it's quite possible she leaves the Hound and it's ambiguous.Â  But there appears to be no good mechanism for QI now.Â  IF they do it, the writers will have really gone around the long way.Â 
Â 
Brienne's arc is proceeding as I expected...Hunt and Tarly aren't established, Maidenpool isn't established, Duskendale isn't established...a ton of work for a trip that seemed pointless even in the book.Â  I like the little "hand tip" with Hot Pie and reminding us of the BwB that way.Â  She could find the helm, I suppose.Â  But it's not really that established a thing.Â  He wears it less, we don't see it hanging on the saddle prominently, etc.Â  It's just not as much of a talisman.Â  Might be an interested background tidbit for readers...she sees it but doesn't even stop.

I that's the case then they'll likely kill off his brother as well. The books hint towards a confrontation between the two for cersei's trial. I'd say we'll see the last of sandor for a couple seasons, if the actor is on board to come back I don't see what would keep d&d from reintroducing a fan favorite.
2355	I'm_Tim	2014-05-19	It's playing out perfectly. When she leaves him to die, it will illustrate her transition from troubled girl to cold killer.

Agree. Now we have four cents. Lol
2359	Blazfemur	2014-05-19	I was definitely surprised to see Rorge and Biter, considering theyre supposed to injure Brienne, and thats how she gets introduced to the brotherhood, as Thoros fixes her up.
Â 
With them dead, the only other speculation, Nimble Dick perhaps? And the jester-dude (his name escapes me at the moment), maybe she gets saved in that scene, by the Brotherhood.
Â 
As far as this mercy killing, setting up the parting Hound and Arya. I don't want to see Sandor receive the mercy killing, it closes the door of the Gravedigger conspiracy, then again, it doesnt look like, witht he pace Brienne and Pod are setting, that they'll even be confronting Quiet Isle, Elder Brother, and the Gravedigger. Im almost certain that whle scenario will be skipped completely, since Sandor and Arya's adventures are becoming mroe of a spotlight.
Â 
Primary difference between show and books in regards to Sandor/Arya? Their developing relationship, and "care," for one another. While Sandor's seems genuine, and believable, I can totally see Arya pulling a 180 and stabbing him, leaving him to die. However, they set it up perfectly, that perhaps the Hound "doesnt survive" the bite from Biter. Perhaps it festers, and eventually, i can see Sandor ordering Arya to leave him be to die.
Â 
Think Arya with Nymeria, as what Sandor would kind of do to Arya to get her to leave on her own. Arya may fight him at first, that she doesnt want to leave him, and then Sandor maybe says some vile things about Sansa, and purposely tries to piss off Arya, leading to her leaving (him only saying such things to get her to leave and not meaning a word of them).
Â 
Still, the timelines are off if he gets discovered by Elder Brother. I think Brienne has to do the nimble dick storyline first, but if theyre gonna include a Lady Stoneheart intro, they better get to that quick, as in, the next episode or two.

Yeah, in the books she just leaves him to die from his wounds but given that they seem closer in the tv show and the fact that she was helping him with his wounds in this episode, I think we are going to see Arya mercy-kill The Hound rather than walk away from him and leave him to die in anguish.
Â 
Â That's just my 2 cents.


Â 
I'd have mixed feelings about that. On the one hand, I always thought her refusal to mercy-kill him in the books was cold. On the other, if she mercy-kills him in the show it would confirm that he's dead in the books.

at first i agree. what the hell is he saying? however
Â 
if he's not dead in the books, and returns, he probably has an important role to play. if he dies on the show, they close that door forever. logically, i dont think d&d would do that, and i think George would steer them.
2363	Darryk	2014-05-19	Â

Â 
The theory that he's still alive surely depends on the fact that we don't see him die in the books. Arya rides away and leaves him.
Â 
If she mercy-kills him in the show, then we know for certain he's not coming back, as if he does feature in GRRM's future plans, the show runners surely would have been told.

Â 
Well, Bowen Marsh played a far bigger role in the books but he seems to have been cut, being as the actor who played him in season 1 is now playing Othell Yarwyck and Alliser Throne is acting as LC. I don't doubt what happens to Jon in aDwD is still going to happen in the show, but it looks like Bowen Marsh won't be involved with it. Same with Rorge being the 'Hound' that's changed and that played a pretty big role with Brienne meeting up with LS. So why don't you think the show won't change other ways events happen?

2366	Seneti	2014-05-19	Arya is obviously trying to kill The Hound right now. We all know of her poor sewing... 


Â 
You just made my dayÂ  
Â 


Â 
Well he did tell her all the horrible things he did and thought about doing before she left him to die. Like how he should have "raped her sister bloody" or something like that. I don't think that will be in the show but a quick Mycha reminder should do the trick.Â 


Â 
Agreed. I think Arya will hesitate to give him the gift, which will make Sandor tell her all those horrible things in the hope that she will rage-kill him, only for her to leave him there.
Â

Â 
The Quiet Isle chapter becomes irrelevant if Arya rams a sword through his heart.
Â 
Look, it's possible he could still be alive in the books, working as a grave digger or however the theory goes, but I was hoping he'd actually return and play a an important role in the story. But if Arya kills him on-screen in the show, then he's playing no further role in the story, because GRRM would have told the show runners not to kill him if he was.
2368	Darryk	2014-05-19	Featuring in GRRM's future plans doesn't mean the producers necessarily adhere to them.


Â 
If GRRM has plans to bring Sandor Clegane back into the story you can damn well bet that the producers will adhere to them. I'm sure they'd loving nothing more than to bring the character back at a later point.
2369	Kingpin	2014-05-19	If the hound isn't supposed to be seen anymore, they could change the book ending and let him live and in good terms. Maybe even make a comeback, why not?Â 
Â 
And to balance this, they can kill someone who is supposed to live, but again has no impact to the rest of the story.Â
2370	Nutbean	2014-05-19	Can I just say that Rory did a great job this episode in showing the Hound's growing despair and hopelessness?Â 
Â 
"You think you're on your own?" It really hit home for me at that moment. Then him sitting on the rock with his head hanging down. He gives a meek nod of consent when Arya offers to wash and sew his wound. The look on his face as she does so....GAH!

He lost quite a few badass points.Â

I still like him, but I feel he's a lot more vulnerable.Â

GRRM has no say but he does advise them, we know this. It's been stressed many times that he advises them, and that sometimes they choose to take his advice and sometimes not.Â 
Â 
Pretty sure that if he told the show runners that he planned to reintroduce the Hound at a later point, they'd be elated. Just don't see them killing the Hound off (on-screen) unless GRRM has made it categorically clear he has no plans to reintroduce the character.
Â 
Very much doubt Arya is going to mercy-kill the Hound in the show anyway so not sure why this discussion has gone on so long.

Â 
I get the argument going back and forth here. On one hand - some of you are saying the show has been given liberty to do what they choose with interpreting the story ... but on the other hand the point others are trying to make is that IF they show Arya giving The Hound the mercy killing instead of just walking away like in the books then we know for a fact he's not coming back later in the story unless there's another "UnClegane" besides Gregor and that would just be - weird.
Â 
However.
Â 
Another example to illustrate this argument's point:
Â 
In the show - they chose to make Jayne Westerling an entirely different character in Robb Stark's story arc - even with a different name and plot line in that she follows him to the Frey's for the wedding where Jayne did not do so in the books. There was wild speculation that having "Talisa" be pregnant meant that Jayne Westerling in the books must also be pregnant because it's created a whole new plot for the Starks. Wrong. They still killed her. BUT - George hasn't killed Jayne Westerling in the books - not that we know of - and so by killing "Talisa" they seem to have closed that plot line and possible theory of a future for Jayne Westerling in the books. George can't very well write Jayne Westerling as alive and kicking with a baby in her belly if the show writers killed off her counterpart - can they?
Â 
Well correlate that to Sandor Clegane.Â IFÂ there's any (even remote) chance that he didn't actually die in the book - and we have no idea where the last book left off - then they can't possibly have Arya give him a Mercy killing on the show ... it would cause an instant disparity between the show and the book that can't be resolved down the road. Right?
Â 
While yes - the showÂ doesÂ take different storyline paths (ie Jon Snow's trip to Craster's to kill the mutineers) ... theyÂ doÂ seem to always circle back around to the same ending anyways. They don't veer so far off the story in the books that it's un-recoverable next season...Â 
Â 
So my point will go to the team that thinks they'll keep it ambiguous like it was in the book and have Arya walk away from the Hound without giving him the mercy.
2376	Frumpus	2014-05-19	I kind of got the impression while reading that her "hating"him was an excuse she told herself for not giving him mercy but I felt as if the real reason was because she didn't want to actually lose another person she had grown close too. Just what I thought but I got have been making that up for myself because I like him. So not really sure
ETA: coz I'm on my phone and pressed reply to early. lol


Â 
This. She loved (in a non sexual way) the Hound and couldn't bring herself to kill him.
2377	Brav	2014-05-19	I know the foreshadowing in the episode is most likely to do with Arya and Sandor's parting but it could be hinting more at what happens to Arya's story next in the books. They could still have the mysterious ending for the Hound and the foreshadowing would still work. It would be a shame if the Hound is just cut out because if he becomes the gravedigger his story then becomes about peace and recovery and it's a change from the live by the sword die by the sword fate you'd expect for a character like the Hound.
2378	Ser Oromus Locke	2014-05-19	If they wanna end the show after 7 season, they will need to cut some stuff out. And if The Hound doesn't play a big part in TWoW and ADoS, I could see them kill him off now instead of having him become the gravedigger. Brienne is likely to meet Lady Stoneheart this season, so she won't stumble upon the gravedigger either. Right now, I feel that there is a strong possibility we'll be seeing the last of The Hound this season.Â 


Â 
There's definitely that chance, but with the current season wrapping up.. There's just so many actors/characters leaving (temporarily)! 
- Joffrey: Dies
- Olenna: Leaves KL, never to return..
- Tywin: Is going to leave a huge gap, unless Kevan returns to the show immediately.
- Shae: Thank god she will be gone.
- Bronn: Hasn't returned to the fold, but might become Cersei's Kettleblack.. Which would be awesome for reasons below..
- Varys: Until he returns at the end of season 5/beginning of season6.
- Lysa: Lol, almost forgotten her already..
- Rorge/Biter: Not really missed, but I anticipated him and Biter tackling Brienne, so I'm a bit upset.
- Polliver: Who am I kidding? xD
- Sandor: ?
- Grenn: ?
Â 
I'm sure I'm missing quite a few..
Â 
Bronn. As we know, the Kettleblacks are hired by Bronn to spy on Cersei for Tyrion. Little does Tyrion know that the Kettleblacks are actually Littefingers men. So we have Tyrion having men in his employ of which he isn't aware that they're actually loyal to Littlefinger. Both book and show Bronn have gone to Cersei and have married with Lollys. There's really no reason why Cersei can't say to Bronn: Can you kill the High Septon for me? It even makes sense for the books, because she wants Bronn dead as well.
Â 
But to the point I wanted to make, the Kettleblacks are in Littlefinger's service in order to spy on Cersei, and Tyrion. Where do we meet Bronn for the very first time? Exactly at the time where Cat and Tyrion meet and the beginnings of the war start. Bronn as a Littlefinger employee would require a lot of work and belief, but it could be the case..Littlefinger sticking a man that close to Tyrion for the entirety of his chaos-plan? Simply removing him when he effectively does not need Tyrion anymore? Sure, you can call it Bronn's own agency, but you can see where Littlefinger gains from having Bronn switch sides between Tyrion and Cersei. Bronn would effectively be a fourth Kettleblack, not counting the old one.
Â 
Cersei could also send him to.. uhh.. seduce/incriminate Margaery's loyalty/virginity/fidelity? I don't see Bronn actively confessing his "sins" of bedding Margaery to the faith - because he's Bronn and not an idiot -, but I guess the show can spin this to the point where somebody just bargess into the room when he's making a move or something..
Â 
Now the reason why the High Septon needs to be killed is not necessarily the same as in the books.. Cersei doesn't get loans apparently in the show. The crown has a big debt to both the IB and the faith. Cersei's reasoning: If I kill the High Septon, they'll bugger off on their loans for some time. Then the High Sparrow comes, Cersei will say something brash like: "I don't owe you anything, we gave you a diamond crown and you sold it", to which the High Sparrow will daftly reply with: "Screw you, I'm calling mah banners..", then Bronn comes in and says like: "oh, did you know that she had sex with me, ordered me to kill your predecessor and try to screw with Margaery? Yeah.. She did.." And boom, she's captured by the faith.. And why would Bronn suddenly be there? On Littlefingers orders, though Littlefinger does say that he did not expect for Cersei to go to the shifter that fast, so the Bronn/Littlefinger-theory is pretty much out of the window for book Bronn, but not necessarily for Show!Bronn.
Â 


Brienne's arc is proceeding as I expected...Hunt and Tarly aren't established, Maidenpool isn't established, Duskendale isn't established...a ton of work for a trip that seemed pointless even in the book.Â  I like the little "hand tip" with Hot Pie and reminding us of the BwB that way.Â  She could find the helm, I suppose.Â  But it's not really that established a thing.Â  He wears it less, we don't see it hanging on the saddle prominently, etc.Â  It's just not as much of a talisman.Â  Might be an interested background tidbit for readers...she sees it but doesn't even stop.


Â 
Hot Pie really was able to condense that storyline effectively.. At first I was almost standing up from my seat with regards if he'll spill the beans or not. Just another great scene in a great episode that I'll love to rewatch over and over.
Â 
As for that storyline, Brienne and Pod are now heading for the Eyrie - eliminating the most annoying plot in the books -, just like Arya and Sandor.. I really think that Sandor can get pushed into a river or something like that during perhaps a clash between Brienne and him, while Arya is somewhere else, practicing for example.. Changes the story pretty much, but hey.. It leaves that lovely ambiguity..
Â 


I that's the case then they'll likely kill off his brother as well. The books hint towards a confrontation between the two for cersei's trial. I'd say we'll see the last of sandor for a couple seasons, if the actor is on board to come back I don't see what would keep d&d from reintroducing a fan favorite.


Â 
That means a one year absence for Rory McCann: Season 5 is the remainder Feast/Dance, Season 6 would include Cersei's trial. Lysa had a two year absence. There might not even be an absence if they rush through the KL-plot.
Â 
I'm still not sold on the Hound fighting UnGregor in the trial though. It still feels like there should be a Warriors Son fighting for the Faith. And killing off a Lannister regardless of the outcome is just something a certain Sandsnake would propose once she has infiltrated Baelor's Sept. That's right: Ser Lancel Lannister vs. Ser Bobby Strong
Â 
Tyene's reasoning:
- Ser Bobby wins: Yay, a Lannister is dead! Nym will take care off Cersei..
- Ser Lancel wins: Yay, Cersei is deadmeat, and Nym will have her way with the small counsel men.

Could be horribly wrong though.. But why else send Tyene to KL if she's not going to have influence on something where the faith is directly involved in being a player for the Dorne endgame?
Â 


Â 
I get the argument going back and forth here. On one hand - some of you are saying the show has been given liberty to do what they choose with interpreting the story ... but on the other hand the point others are trying to make is that IF they show Arya giving The Hound the mercy killing instead of just walking away like in the books then we know for a fact he's not coming back later in the BOOKstory unless there's another "UnClegane" besides Gregor and that would just be - weird.

Â 
So my point will go to the team that thinks they'll keep it ambiguous like it was in the book and have Arya walk away from the Hound without giving him the mercy.


Â 
Of course George can.. He's going to do whatever he wants with his books. The show killed off XXD, while George still used him in Dance.. Is the show in trouble for this, for they're approaching that storyline? Not really, they'll work around it. The show can kill off Sandor, even if George uses him in Winds.
Â 
The showrunners are taking steps to make sure that the show runs smoothly and thus they can cut storylines. GRRM can still give Jeane her baby, it wouldn't likely add much to the current storyline and would likely just give the Starks another heir for the future - which may not be important to D&D for them to tell the current story.
Â 
As for circling storylines, they've added another new one: Hizdahr going to negotiate with Yunkai, along with Daario and the 2ndSons. Obviously this is just to stretch out the plot for Dany's Meereen arc as peace won't be achieved here obviously (while it does give the oppurtunity for the showrunners to imply that Hizdahr is working with Yunkai. That's the circle they can show, whereas the books this is left out, but heavily implied. As for Daario, he's being morphed into Brown Ben apparently also going over to Yunkai (making the "I took the Meereenese navy for you" a circle jerk as well: Dany had ships, and could've gone to Westeros, but she didn't, she got betrayed and now she's stuck in a siege without a navy. That's a great way to end this season for her.

Â 
Wait, what? You've got this reversed in order. George wrote Xaro Xhoan Daxos in the books and then HBO decided to kill him off earlier not the other way around. Nothing they do on the show is going to influence George to write different outcomes if they kill off a character he didn't like that.Â 
Â 
But since you used that as your example, tell me what outcome is changed by killing off XXD before George did in the book? He gave her a few ships (13 I think?) which she kept but it's not enough to take her and her armies across the narrow sea to invade Westeros. Because they killed him off on the show, does that mean George will kill him off? No. More than likely it just means his part in her story goes nowhere and therefore he's an expendable character.
Â 
My point still stands and your argument really didn't change anything.Â 
Â 
IF they kill off the Hound directly without leaving it vague the way George did in the book then it more than likely means there's no future for him in the books final endgame. Even if he's not really dead, he's still not part of the story or else they'd keep him in the show as he's a central character in many episodes across the past 4 seasons.Â 
Â 
The debate is whether or not Arya will give The Hound the mercy killing or walk away from him to leave him die slowly the way it was left in the book. I pointed out both sides of the argument for and against it and why the show can kill off certain characters that are still living in the books and not others. Killing off a main character like Cersei, Jaime, Tyrion, etc would be much different. The gray area exists with secondary characters who may or may not have future roles in the epic story's end game. Xaros, Jayne Westerling and yes even The Hound all fit into those categories.

Â 
If Sandor Clegane has a role to play in TWOW/ADOS, and it's stemmed from him being the gravedigger then coming back, they will not kill off Sandor openly on the show.
Â 
IF, Sandor IS The Gravedigger, however, andÂ the determination is made in the books he's to live out his years in repentence and he serves as a living easter egg, to disappear into obscurity (which, i feel, would be his true redemption, burying his hatred for his brother and leaving that nest of vipers that is kings landing), then they wont have any trouble killing him off on the show and keeping out Quiet Isle in it's entirety.
Â 
If, Sandor is not the Gravedigger, he will die this season.

In the book he actually cries. Several times I believe.
2382	yushkevitch	2014-05-19	I started a separate thread speculating on where Arya's story goes from here but looks like it wasn't approved.
Â 
Basically, I suggested the show may cut out Arya's training in Braavos. Here's why:
Â 
1) She's clearly getting on-the-job experience with the Hound. She's already coldly killed two men and is well on her way to being a full-time killer. Of course she won't learn the "faceless" part of her training her but ..
Â 
2) The writers know where her story is going so it's quite possible they've seen a way to make it work without her learning the secrets of the Faceless Men. She can still be an assassin but if anything she does down the road is not critical to the main plot it can be re-worked.
Â 
3) The show seems to be speeding up several storylines and it's clear they've done so by condensing time in some cases. Let's face it, Arya's time in Braavos was quite possibly a result of Martin needing to find a way to occupy her time - she couldn't wander around Westeros with the Hound forever.
Â 
4) While her time in Braavos makes for mostly great reading I think a lot of it won't translate very well into television - and it's clear from her chapter in TWoW she's still has at least a small way to go before she's a full FM. Do we really need to see her chasing cats, insisting she's no one, disrobing corpses and serving food for a couple of seasons?
Â 
5) Maisie is growing fast. In the books she's still young when she gets to Braavos and it's possible Martin felt she had to stay there for a few years in part so she'll be old enough to be a credible assassin. In the TV series Williams' Arya is already killing men and we're not snickering - she's not a fully grown woman yet but far closer than book Arya was when she was with the Hound.
Â 
Yes, I know, what I suggest is blasphemy! How could they cut out her entire time in Braavos when so many readers love that part of the series so much? By coming up with an alternative - like the Hound sticking around for awhile perhaps - that we love just as much?

2383	lostinwesteros	2014-05-19	Yeah, Sandor is one of my favorite characters. Â I'm anxious to see how they handle Arya's leaving him. Â She's got to, of course, so she can set sail for Bravos, but I hope they don't kill him off even if they're not ever going to use them again in the show. Â We readers can then just know that he lives and makes it to the Quiet Isle, which is what I believe happens in the book.
2384	Newstar	2014-05-19	I started a separate thread speculating on where Arya's story goes from here but looks like it wasn't approved.
Â 
Basically, I suggested the show may cut out Arya's training in Braavos. Here's why:
Â 
1) She's clearly getting on-the-job experience with the Hound. She's already coldly killed two men and is well on her way to being a full-time killer. Of course she won't learn the "faceless" part of her training her but ..

Â 
The 4x10 IMDB page lists a "Braavosi captain"...around the same time Arya should be getting on a ship.
Â 
I think the reason that the Hound is being given so much screentime in Season 4 is that it's the last time we'll be seeing the character for a while at least. It's sending off the character--even if temporarily--in style.

Â 


I don't think it's possible to omit Arya's arc in Bravos, even if it's greatly abbreviated, simply because I think it's crucial to the role she'll play in Westeros in TWOW (viz. the Mercy chapter we've recently been given). Â

2386	LionsAndTitsAndWineOhMy	2014-05-19	I'm guessing Arya and Sandor's parting will be similar to the books, the big difference being the bite wound will bring him down. Sandor will probably still basically turn nasty and bring up lots of bad stuff to get Arya to give him a quick death, which she won't give.
Â 
The bigger thing I wonder about is: Â are we going to get the Quiet Isle, and if so, how? Â It looks like they're speeding Brienne's arc up (evidenced by the early demise of Biter and Rorge amongst other signs), and I'm guessing this season ends with Brienne and Pod meeting up with the BwB and the reveal of LS. Â With only 3 episodes left, it definitely doesn't seem likely the Quiet Isle scene is going to play out like the books.
Â 
Perhaps next season Jamie will pay a visit to the Quiet Isle and notice a large gravedigging novice with a scarf?
2387	Seneti	2014-05-20	Â 
If Sandor Clegane has a role to play in TWOW/ADOS, and it's stemmed from him being the gravedigger then coming back, they will not kill off Sandor openly on the show.
Â 
IF, Sandor IS The Gravedigger, however, andÂ the determination is made in the books he's to live out his years in repentence and he serves as a living easter egg, to disappear into obscurity (which, i feel, would be his true redemption, burying his hatred for his brother and leaving that nest of vipers that is kings landing), then they wont have any trouble killing him off on the show and keeping out Quiet Isle in it's entirety.
Â 
If, Sandor is not the Gravedigger, he will die this season.


Â 
Agreed. The series has enough characters as it is (comes with the medium - large casts are always harder to remember on screen than on paper), so unless Sandor will have a part in TWOW/ADOS for which he is singularly qualified, it would make sense for D&D to kill him off. Emphasis on "singularly qualified" because some roles are interchangeable. Example: XXD getting killed. His only part in ADWD is to come to Dany as a representative of Quarth who tries to threaten/bribe her. Any representative of Quarth can do that.
Â 
Roles for which I can see Sandor being singularly qualified:
- fighting against Ser Strong in Cersei's trial (as it has repeatedly been made clear that very few people in Westeros would stand a chance against him, Sandor being one of those few)
- anything related to Sansa/Arya and their previous, specific interactions with him
2388	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-20	Even if Sandor doesn't have an important role in WoW they could still keep him alive and show him in a Hotpie-style cameo in the future. The non-readers would lose their shit, him being a fan-favorite and all.
Â 
I don't know if they're doing Quiet Isle, though, but they could come up with some way to have that cameo. It would be a relatively happy ending for the character, showing he maybe found peace and redemption in the end
2389	CersiGoesCrazy	2014-05-20	The Hound-Arya relationship is so sweet and touching in the show. I can't see Arya giving him the gift of mercy because I firmly believe that Sandor is the Novice/Gravedigger. She'll leave him to die, but I don't know how it will play out.
To be honest, even if she killed him on the show I'd still believe in the Novice/Gravedigger theory. In the books he might play a minor part they decide to cut out because it's not important enough for the show, so he could die on the show but live in the books. I do not want to believe he's dead.
2390	CersiGoesCrazy	2014-05-20	Yes!  Feast of Crows p 661.  Grave digger is bigger than Brienne and he's lame.  Why else mention those two thing?
2391	CersiGoesCrazy	2014-05-20	Yes!  Feast of Crows p 661.  Grave digger is bigger than Brienne and he's lame.  Why else mention those two thing?
2392	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-20	A girl has sworn to put her sword through a man's eye and out the back of his skull.
Â 
A man has a bite wound, and has scorned proper medical care.
Â 
A girl shall get a chance to take a name off her list, one way or another.
2393	Rapsie	2014-05-20	The bite wound makes sense as it could still affect his fighting ability if left to fester and infects the muscles round his shoulder and back. Also if the Hound does come back, well god love him but Rory is not the greatest actor in the world and a limp may not be the easiest to pull off without being comical. A reduced reach and sword swinging ability is much easier to pull off.
2394	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-20	This assumes the results are permanent.
Â 
The trouble with an infected neck wound is it would be difficult to survive. If it necrotizes, it is hitting vital things pretty much right away. Not like you can amputate your head.
(Well, not that I expect the show to get all medical about it.)
2395	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-20	Anyway, my one other BIG comlpaint about the Arya portrayal:
Â 
No Nymeria, no wolf dreams, no "rise and run with us". (At least not yet.)Â

2396	Domonju	2014-05-20	Â 
If GRRM has plans to bring Sandor Clegane back into the story you can damn well bet that the producers will adhere to them. I'm sure they'd loving nothing more than to bring the character back at a later point.


Â 
Not necessarily true. D&D kill off plenty of characters that are still alive in he books. Mago, Irri, etc. It all depends on the story THEY want to tell, not exactly what GRRM wants. If they think Sandor's story in any upcoming novels isn't important enough, expect the gift of mercy. if it is important, then expect no gift.
I guess it will also depend on what they decide to do with the mountain. Will he become a armor wearing zombie.Â
2397	Le Cygne	2014-05-20	Yeah, I'm hoping it's not the bite wound that does him in, but the wound in the upcoming fight. There's going to be a big one ahead, Rory said it goes on forever. He wouldn't last very long if he was weakened, I don't think. I don't think they'll kill him off, and I don't think he's going to stay a gravedigger, he's got a role to play, so he'll be back on the show, too. They'll likely leave it ambiguous as in the books. Mostly going by the books here, but we have some spoilers.And also Blackwater, Bronn said, "It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women. And good brown ale. Plenty for everyone And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground." I think it's been established he wants a woman and ale on the show (some references this season, "Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?" and what did he do just before he left, and then "How can a man not keep ale in his home"), so what's to come is a little gravedigging duty, perhaps.

2398	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-20	The parting between these two (I don't believe for one second that Arya will give him the gift of mercy) has high potential for tears.
2399	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-20	I love their dynamic in the show, I really, really do. I believe that she'll refuse to just kill him and it will be left ambiguous like in the books whether or not he's dead, because I strongly believe the gravedigger theory and I DO NOT WANT HIM TO DIE.Â
2400	Roose Seal	2014-05-20	I love their dynamic in the show, I really, really do. I believe that she'll refuse to just kill him and it will be left ambiguous like in the books whether or not he's dead, because I strongly believe the gravedigger theory and I DO NOT WANT HIM TO DIE.Â 


While I love the Gravedigger theory too.. is the show even going to do the Quiet Isle?Â 
Â 
I have no idea what they're going to do with Brienne's arc right now... because as much as I love her chapters in FFC for their ample descriptions of the effects of war on the common folk,.. I think it's going to make for some pretty dull TV if they film it as it is.

I really have no idea where they're going with Brienne to be honest with you, it doesn't actually look like we'll see the Quiet Isle, but i'm still hoping.Â
2402	Chebyshov	2014-05-20	I just don't see the QI really adding anything to the show, other than maybe showing Sandor alive. But if they're going that route, it'd be more streamlined to just give him an ambiguous ending and then he pops up later. Maybe Brienne has kickass TWOW content? Also does this mean Jaime's story is likely to be truncated?
2403	'96Buck	2014-05-20	Â 
If Sandor Clegane has a role to play in TWOW/ADOS, and it's stemmed from him being the gravedigger then coming back, they will not kill off Sandor openly on the show.

Â 
If, Sandor is not the Gravedigger, he will die this season.


Good encapsulation, BUT...if GRRM doesn't want Readers to infer from an obvious death that it's one of the latter two scenarios, they could still leave it open on the show also.
2404	Roose Seal	2014-05-20	I just don't see the QI really adding anything to the show, other than maybe showing Sandor alive.

Also does this mean Jaime's story is likely to be truncated?


I dunno, I think the Quiet Isle would make for a very pretty location (they could film in Mont St Michel?) and there's some great dialogue in that chapter and those leading to it. It could serve as a nice "calm before the storm" sequence before Brienne gets her face eaten and encounters the BWB.
2405	'96Buck	2014-05-20	I just don't see the QI really adding anything to the show, other than maybe showing Sandor alive.

Also does this mean Jaime's story is likely to be truncated?


Jaime's story was always going to be truncated.Â  With 1-2 dozen new speaking characters, extended horse-travel,Â  several new castles, multiple armies encamped @ Riverrun, etc the cost of producing it is too much for the storytelling return.Â 
Â 
Part of why Jaime came back to KL "early" IMO was so that his development arc that GRRM shows through the Riverlands campaign will be "shortcut" with his scenes with Tywin and Cersei and Bronn on the show.
2406	'96Buck	2014-05-20	I really have no idea where they're going with Brienne to be honest with you, it doesn't actually look like we'll see the Quiet Isle, but i'm still hoping.Â 


She and Pod are going to encounter BwB, and now she knows they had Arya since Hot Pie told her, so she's going to go into "Knight mode" and boldly declare her quest, being sworn to Lady Stark, etc.Â Â  They will either escort or capture her for the trip to their cave, and Ep10 reveals LS.

This seems likely to me, though I'm still having problems figuring out when she's going to bite of someone's ear. I guess it could be right before this if it's like a surprise attack?

BWB will probably not introduce themselves genially.Â  Some level of fighting.Â  She's more likely a prisoner, IMO, than guest for LS.Â  Wouldn't surprise me if she has to surrender b/c they grab up Pod.

Gendry saves her in the scene in which she gets injured. I haven't heard anything about Joe Dempsie filming, but Show!Gendry went off to KL by boat, didn't he? Wonder where he'd even pop up.
2413	Newstar	2014-05-20	Joe Dempsie is not back for Season 4, but I doubt TV Gendry would want anything to do with the BWB after they sold him to Melisandre in any event.
Apparently the actor for Anguy tweeted something about filming for Season 4 before deleting it.
2414	Nick_Scryer	2014-05-20	Hearing Rory McCann talk about an upcoming battle has me worried/excited for what's to come in episode 8.

Â 
It's possible he was talking about the battle at the wall (that he won't be apart of) but I'm going to believe its a big battle at the gates of the moon.
Â 
I wonder what happens? Is it possible that they ask to see Lysa and are told she's dead, the Hound gets agitated and angry and a brawl breaks out. The Hound takes out a lot of the knights and is about to make an escape when Brienne and Pod come upon the brawl at the gate. Brienne joins in the fight to protect Arya. Then the BWB arrive and it's all out carnage. Brienne bites off someones ear, Hound gets stabbed (even though he already has his death bite) and lots of people die, blood guts everywhere.
Â 
Somehow Arya and the Hound escape in the mess, Brienne and Pod are captured and are to be taken to the BWB HQ for ep10. Cue Stoneheart. The lords in the Vale (along with Sansa) hear of the brawl at the gate and Sansa wonders what if the Hound had come to rescue her and who the girl with him was.
Â 
Speculation no matter how crazy is awesome

Â 
If, Sandor is not the Gravedigger, he will die this season.


Â 
These are all reasonable outcomes.
Â 
I think if they do have Arya kill him openly then that probably means they intend to leave out the Gravedigger bits even if they do show Pod and Brienne on the Quiet Isle.Â 
Â 
As much as I liked that story arc, I can see them leaving it out entirely. If the Gravedigger theories are true, it still doesn't change the end story and Sandor Clegane plays no real part in the outcome so they will likely cut that.
2420	Faceless Man Friday	2014-05-20	They could leave all the suspense out of whether the Hound is dead or alive but to do so would detract from the story. Â It is so much better that we do not really know and I think with the way the characters have developed through the acting of Rory and Maisie I believe it would make a much more dramatic conclusion if she refuses him the gift of mercy for very mixed but highly emotional reasons and leaves him to.... die???? Â I do not think D&D will miss an opportunity like that.

true. i would think those are the three logical ways to interpret the turnabout, yes.
2425	Chebyshov	2014-05-20	Regardless of Sandor's part to play in TWOW/ADOS, I think there's no way Arya kills him. It's a dark moment for her character and it needs to be in there. I'm betting on an ambiguous death, like in the books.

Â 
this is what im hopinh for. im thinking Sandor's neck wound festers, he falls to the ground, leans against a tree, and arya attempts to help him. Sandor refuses her help, and wants her to leave, to genuinely get to The Vale, and thats when he starts talking shit to get her to leave (again, much like the Arya-Nymeria connection). This is when he may talk shit about Sansa to Arya, and Arya eventually gets pissed off and leaves him to "die."
2427	yushkevitch	2014-05-20	When a bad-guy-turned-sort-of-good-guy opens up emotionally in a show or movie it's a sure sign he's about to die.
Â 
Secondly, he was wounded for a reason, I'd guess for more than just a segue to his sentimental moment. The safe bet is he'll get an infection that will either kill him outright (quickly) or he'll suffer a slow death.
Â 
Third, I didn't like how the the Hound just faded out of the story in the books and I'd bet the writers agree. If he does die this season he should go out in a blaze of glory. So a possible infection may just slow him down enough for a mere mortal man (or woman ...) to strike him down.

Not likely.As many people have already mentioned Arya's denial to give him the gift of mercy is a highlight of her character's story and thus far they don't seem to change these kind of moments.They may alter the story that leads there but the result is still the same.
Anyway as far i see most people agree that Sandor could die or live in the show without really changing anything and i believe only those who hope for some great appearance in the forthcoming books think differently.
Now the only thing that i'm curious though is how Brienne's story will turn out since they seem to have shorten it.AFFTC didn't have many great moments and if you drop some of them at the 4th season which was already full of big events what the hell are you gonna show at the next season?
Also i'm curious about the "Maybe Sansa is there (at the Vale) too.Could this be a forshadowing of some Brienne-Sansa interaction?

That's pretty much what i'm predicting and quite sure will happen...im just concerned a clear death will have all the purists screaming and calling for D&D's heads and claiming it's a huge spoiler and so forth...
2439	Newstar	2014-05-20	My one hope is based on my observation that D&D seem to love to tie up loose ends and have been really unsubtle in Season 4 when it comes to show mysteries and ambiguities. Look at how swiftly and how clearly they established who killed Joffrey. One writer even came out and said not long ago that Syrio is dead, which was not so subtly hinted at by the Hound's dialogue. They are not fucking around this season when it comes to loose ends, and I hope that will be reflected in the way they deal with the Hound's fate.

hell with LSH in the mix, even if they clearly show Hound's death, no saying he cant come back and pillage like the mountain...grave robber theory can stay a mystery for the purists
2441	Girlicious	2014-05-20	Hi everyone.
Well I was thinking about the very pious farmer the Hound stole silver from. It is just an opinion of course, I am not saying this will happen or anything... but somehow, I think this guy would make a nice subtitute for the Elder Brother.
I am saying that because when they met him the first time, he greeted them with "seven blessings" and I immediatly thought "Elder Brother!"
Â 
Even though I love my Hound and I'm dreading to see him go, I think his most coherent fate is death. Whether a clean "on screen" oneÂ  (noooo!) or an ambigous one like in the book (pleeeease!). And then found and cured by the forgiving farmer once more, who he would protect, help with his farm work and live in peace with once he learned the Mountain is dead. The farmer seems to be living in an area sscluded to allow such a scenario to me. No one would know where the Hound is and whoever come across the farm would meet the Hound' sword anyway.
I don't think we will have any Quite Isle at all, tbh. Cause there is no leg injury, no reason for the Hound to set his sword down.
A Brienne/Sandor interaction? Why not.
But a Brienne/farmer interaction? I am quite positive about this one.
Of course, an infection in the neck area would be impossible to cure normally but well... this is a show, set in a fantastic world. It's ok if it's not "realistic".

2442	Girlicious	2014-05-20	Sorry for the double post.
I also think that Arya is going to remove the Hound from her list next time we see them.
Their last scene together was too sweet and compassionate.
Like... next time she will recite all the names before going to sleep (while the Hound's wound is festering), she will leave his name out and he will look at her like "what the hell...?".
2443	Seneti	2014-05-20	Â 
Not necessarily true. D&D kill off plenty of characters that are still alive in he books. Mago, Irri, etc. It all depends on the story THEY want to tell, not exactly what GRRM wants. If they think Sandor's story in any upcoming novels isn't important enough, expect the gift of mercy. if it is important, then expect no gift.
I guess it will also depend on what they decide to do with the mountain. Will he become a armor wearing zombie.Â 


Â 
To be fair though, for everything we know about the future books they have not yet killed off any characters whose roles can't be taken by other characters in the future.
Â 


Wherever helmets go...

This is gold!Â

Â 
I'd like to see the ambiguous death along with goading Arya to kill him by saying he didn't do enough for Sansa. The scenes they showed in Season 2 with the Hound and Sansa seemed ambiguous themselves. Why have him say he would protect her from Joffrey? Why have him offer to take her to Winterfell and then leave on saying he wouldn't hurt her, seeming to sense her fear of him? They need to tie that up with his dialogue at the end.
2445	Girlicious	2014-05-21	They need to tie that up with his dialogue at the end.
Â 
I am hoping for that too. That would be nice
2446	Le Cygne	2014-05-21	And he was the one who really did want to take her home.   The others lied and wanted to steal her home.
The guy who protected her over and over again and risked his life to save hers, actually meant it, and is trying to do the same for her sister, get her back to her family (and of course, be a part of that family, too, which is the subtext, and why he was so bummed now that he's seeing it's not likely to happen.
2447	Newstar	2014-05-21	Â 
I am hoping for that too. That would be nice


Â 
I guess the problem is that TV Sandor was far more gentlemanly towards Sansa than Book Sandor, so he has relatively little to "confess," apart from failing to intervene when Ser Meryn was beating her. Nor can I see TV Sandor, even if the show is about to kill him off for real, telling Arya that he should have raped Sansa and ripped her heart out rather than leave her for Tyrion (assuming he learns at some point that Sansa married Tyrion), even if it's only done to goad Arya into killing him. I guess TV Sandor could always make some shit up about Sansa, since thanks to the TV show (and the lack of potentially unreliable POV filters) we would know that he was lying.
Â 
Question: is TV Sandor going to find out about Sansa marrying Tyrion? The bit with "The king's dead" and explaining about Joffrey being poisoned seemed like the perfect place to include it. I guess Sandor could learn that information at the Bloody Gate. Seems like a weird omission.

As for Arya's hit-list, what was really powerful for me in the books was not knowing that the Hound was dead, and then having Arya leave his name off anyways. It is a huge step forward in her story and character development. It adds another dimension, really. I hope they leave Sandor's death ambiguous, and that they have Arya leave his name off her list in the HoBaW. *fingers crossed*

Call me a pessimist, but I thought she left his name off because she assumed he was dead.
2450	DaveyJoe	2014-05-21	I got the impression she took if off because her time with him allowed her to see him as a human, who is also suffering a lot, not just an evil name to be crossed off her list. Â Alive or dead, I think she would have crossed him off her list.
2451	Facelesss Fan	2014-05-21	I kind of got the impression while reading that her "hating"him was an excuse she told herself for not giving him mercy but I felt as if the real reason was because she didn't want to actually lose another person she had grown close too. Just what I thought but I got have been making that up for myself because I like him. So not really sure
ETA: coz I'm on my phone and pressed reply to early. lol


  totally.
2452	Newstar	2014-05-21	Maybe it's splitting hairs, but I tend to associate Arya "crossing off" names on her list with them dying, and removing a name from her list as meaning she no longer intends to kill the person, regardless of whether they're alive or dead.
Maisie Williams did say that Arya would be crossing names off her list this season, but that could refer to Joffrey and Polliver.
2453	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-21	Arya is obviously trying to kill The Hound right now. We all know of her poor sewing... 


Â 
Â 
OMG!!!Â  Best laugh of the day so far.Â
2454	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-21	Even if Sandor doesn't have an important role in WoW they could still keep him alive and show him in a Hotpie-style cameo in the future. The non-readers would lose their shit, him being a fan-favorite and all.
Â 
I don't know if they're doing Quiet Isle, though, but they could come up with some way to have that cameo. It would be a relatively happy ending for the character, showing he maybe found peace and redemption in the end

You are spot on with the Hot Pie analysis.Â  Sandor could be seen at any old Sept somewhere if they aren't doing Quiet Isle.Â  I do suspect an ending for Arya and the Hound similar to the books with all the complicated reasons of their respect and dislike for each other, all rolled into one.Â  Sandor/Rory not only seems to be a favorite of the showrunners and more and more with the tvshow fans, but they've given him alot of screen time, and I don't think it was just for Arya and her story that they did this.Â  I suspect that both GRRM and the show have plans to revisit Sandor after Arya and him part and after the QI scenes.Â  I'm more and more of the mind that he must reemerge from the QI eventually.Â  I've always been of the mind that Sandor's penance will be complete once he has dug enough graves to equal the amount of bodies left in his wake as The Hound.Â 
Â 
ETA:Â  This is in answer to Jon of the (Evil) Dead and the post about Sandor at least having the Hot Pie type cameo and all, but the site went down for me a minute and at least some of my typing was saved by the auto save.Â  Sorry the reply quote was lost.Â

Â 
Aye, he was a bleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeder.Â  I love that line, can't help it.Â  I suppose Sandor could confess all those feelings about why he went to Sansa's room in the first place, regarldess of what was actually shown and said on the show in S2.Â  I'm starting to wonder if there really will be an encounter between The Hound and Arya and Brienne and Pod, rife with misunderstandings about intentions, a fight, and the word that Sansa did marry the Imp and fled after Joffrey's death.Â  I am thinking we will need The Hound to have that information about Sansa to facilitate his last pain and rage induced outburst to Arya.Â  I think all he said was just to get Arya to kill him and put him out of all his misery, along with subconsciously wanting Arya to do the exact opposite or at least point out that she had him all wrong, then give him the gift of Mercy.Â

I have to tell you I thought the very same thing. It may only be wishful thinking, but I could see Arya taking him back, with the money he stole, and reminding the farmer about "her father" and the troubles he "suffered". After all, it's not like Arya has anything to do before Ep. 10 anyway, where the cast hints at a Bravosi Captain. 
The Hound can then be seen in the fields by Brienne and Pod on the way to the Eyrie. And later, he can come out to save the day, most likely Sansa, just when all seems lost for her.
Far-fetched, I admit, but could be pulled off IF Martin has the Hound in future books still alive.

You meant "area" of things, right?  Anyways if you know what happens, please don't spoiler me. That wouldn't be nice.  But I just don't think Area will do it!
2467	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-22	Ok I think the names are a bit confusing, I guess I will just have to live with the fact that I do not always know who is who right away? Thanks Chebyshov for clearing that up.

The show does seem to have problems with keeping the names on the lips of those who are only tv viewers and not readers of the books, too.Â  Hell, the show has even neglected to give out names to the dragons, and if I recall correctly, I'm not sure the show ever made clear that Robb's direwolf was named Grey Wind.
Â 
Considering we are on our third actor playing The Mountain, and the other two weren't shown that frequently, it's understandable that there is confusion.Â  I think with The Hound (Sandor) being so popular a character MIGHT help some actually keep it straight that he is the brother of the Mountain.Â  Sandor and Gregor of House Clegane, built on dead children...as said by Thoros of Myr, dead Targ children who happen to be Oberyn's niece and nephew.Â  It is a shame that the show hasn't done better at making a lot of these connections clear, much less just their proper names.Â 
Â 
But, not to be mean....if you are looking for help with names and characters, you must realize by now....that you are not spelling Arya correctly?Â  Arya not Area, LOLÂ

A good way to avoid being spoiled is to not look at threads with the disclaimer "book spoilers" in its title. You guys should feel more than free to start a (non-spoiler) thread in this sub-forum about Ayra & and The Hound's fates.
2469	AreaStark	2014-05-22	Lady Fevre Dream: Are you saying Area's name is spelled Arya? That looks odd, though, are you sure? I don't know, Area looks prettier to me and I am used as thinking of it as Area, though! I think I will just keep saying Area, I mean who cares anyway, right?
Â

Â 
No, I'm saying that this thread is specifically for people with book knowledge to use what we know of the plot to speculate on what is coming up with Ayra and Sandor's storyline. So there's a very high probability someone will say something that spoils it for you. You could open a thread titled "Non-spoiler speculation on Ayra & The Hound," which hopefully wouldn't be awkward.

Yeah, I'm feeling twitchy, too, but was trying to go with the benefit of the doubt.
Â 
I did mean to also point out that there ar'e many 'spoiler free' threads on this section of the forum, this is specifically marked for 'book spoilers.'Â  Starting a spoiler free Arya and The Hound thread would work for those who would like it (if it gets approved, not totally sure how that works on this forum).Â  There is also the general discussion thread that is labelled 'no spoilers.'Â  I'm not sure how much action in posting it gets, though?

Yes, Arya is spelled Arya.Â  You can brave the book thread, as this is a book thread, but if you don't want the spoilers, probably best not to read it at all, or skim quickly, LOL
2473	hendo colpatis	2014-05-22	in my books it is written as 'arya' but i bought my books in a strange arya of town so you might be right .the mixed feelings she has towards the hound now make sense but she still seethes at the evil he represents which i feel is a good thing. too often the characters do great evil and are treated as if there is nothing to it.
2474	AreaStark	2014-05-22	Geee, you guys are making a big deal out of nothing.

Hound of The Spoilerville?Â  Sorry, couldn't resist.Â  I always suspected that The Gravedigger's time on The Quiet Isle will be over once he has buried the amount of bodies that equal his previous kills, then......time's his, as Andy Reid would say, and he's outta there.Â

I can't say as I'm sure why Sandor would leave the Quiet Isle, but I suspect he may already have left, offscreen, offpage, as it were.Â  I'm thinking he will somehow wind up tied into the Brienne and Jaime and Lady Stonehart situation.Â  It's a little pet wish of mine, that somehow....the search for Arya and Sansa and Brienne's quest will have already pulled him Off Island, as it were, Lost Like.

He's such a complex character, and already exhibiting signs of "changing" pre-QI. But that's a good dichotomy you bring up: is he going to be more after revenge/"justice" against his brother or more concerned with safety for the Stark girls. I have a sinking feeling that if he and Robert Strong face off, neither will make it out alive, so it's like he'd be pulled in one direction or the other.

Okay, to get back on topic, I'd miss Sandor more, TV show and book version.Â  D&D seem really taken with both Rory and The Hound, I wonder how long they can let us go without seeing any Gravedigging.Â  I highly doubt they will absolutely kill him off, as some think might happen, if Sandor is doomed to the Quiet Isle forever.Â  I really believe the grave for a grave idea of mine.Â  Once he's buried the right amount of bodies, he's free to go.Â

I wonder alot about the Ser Robert thing, in relation to Sandor.Â  While I can see the symmetry in them facing each other, I'm thinking it might just be the living he needs to be more concerned with, instead of vengeance on his UnDead Bro, or his fate will be sealed.Â  I think IF and most likely, when he faces Ser Strong it would have to be for the realm in general, not just himself and his anger, to make it out of there alive.Â  I need that Frankenstein buried, though, ya know.Â  I am curious what's up under the helm.

I don't think it's about compatability for Sandor and LS, I think, moreso, The Hound will/may be a wildcard in getting Jaime and Brienne out of that messy situation.Â  I'm thinking more along those lines.Â  I'm all for dead Freys, but I do think LS has to go, in the long run.Â  I'm just hoping she learns most of her Cat's children are alive before she does.Â

I've always had a hard time with some of those Bran visions and the wording. Â It's obvious lots of it was about the present time, but....at that specific time, The Mountain was not in the area, LOL Â Maybe it is some type of foreshadowing that all three will wind up in the same place, which would imply KL. Â I'm not sure I see Cersei sending her Quiet Giant far from her side. Â Batshit Crazy she may be, but at least she seems to understand that most of the realm wants her dead. Â Why have an obedient monster made for you, if not to keep him by your side? Â 
Â

No one saw the Mountain die, and no one saw his head removed. That troubles me, I confess, but what could the bitch queen hope to accomplish by deceiving us? If Gregor Clegane is alive, soon or late the truth will out. The man was eight feet tall, there is not another like him in all of Westeros. If any such appears again, Cersei Lannister will be exposed as a liar before all the Seven Kingdoms. She would be an utter fool to risk that. What could she hope to gain?

So, you do think it's Gregor's face/head under there?Â  I've always been up in the air about it, GRRM is just somewhat sneaky sometimes.Â  I know the spec is that one of the overly large heads from one of the dead dwarves was sent to Dorne, but sneaky George left it that it could go either way.Â  Maybe he hasn't decided that for himself yet.Â  Doesn't Kevan wonder IF there is even anything under there himself in his epilogue?Â  That speaks volumes to me, sensible Kevan wondering about all these kind of things, LOLÂ

Oh no, I think it's nothing there, or like some gross black-blood kind of stuff. Nymeria would be like "hey, we have a big ass skull to someone that no one saw die, and here's a big ass guy with no head."

Though good point about the dwarves. They've made a point to continually mention dead dwarves being sent to Cersei. Mayhaps.

â<U+0080><U+009C>The silent giant.â<U+0080><U+009D> Lord Randyll grimaced. â<U+0080><U+009C>Tell me, ser, where did this man come from?â<U+0080><U+009D>
demanded Mace Tyrell. â<U+0080><U+009C>Why have we never heard his name before? He does not speak, he will not
show his face, he is never seen without his armor. Do we know for a certainty that he is even a knight?â<U+0080><U+009D>
We do not even know if heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s alive. Meryn Trant claimed that Strong took neither food nor drink,
and Boros Blount went so far as to say he had never seen the man use the privy. Why should he? Dead
men do not shit. Kevan Lannister had a strong suspicion of just who this Ser Robert really was beneath
that gleaming white armor. A suspicion that Mace Tyrell and Randyll Tarly no doubt shared. Whatever
the face hidden behind Strongâ<U+0080><U+0099>s helm, it must remain hidden for now. The silent giant was his nieceâ<U+0080><U+0099>s
only hope. And pray that he is as formidable as he appears.

Oh no, I think it's nothing there, or like some gross black-blood kind of stuff. Nymeria would be like "hey, we have a big ass skull to someone that no one saw die, and here's a big ass guy with no head."
Â 
Though good point about the dwarves. They've made a point to continually mention dead dwarves being sent to Cersei. Mayhaps.
Â 
Here's the epilogue stuff:
Â 


Â 
Ah, okay, just trying to keep it straight.Â  I do wonder if George himself is still deciding.Â  Thanks for the passage, too.Â  It's amazing to me that a sensible man like Kevan had to wade through those type of thoughts.Â  It may be a world of magic and all, but Kevan, like Tywin and most of the Lannister family in general, seem not to extend the idea of magic beyond the idea of magical creatures like dragons.Â  Poor Kevan, I miss him, too.Â  I was so interested to read his POV and so upset that he died during it.........that most of the time I forgetÂ that Pycelle was killed, too, and I forget to celebrate.Â 
Â 
I'm wondering (and trying to get back a bit more OT), is Gregor's face necessary for any emotional payoff in a confrontation with him and Sandor?Â  The above dream/vision of Bran's that seemed to star Sandor, Jaime, and Gregor (or what's left of him, black blood) bespeaks of the possiblity of all three coming together, but if the thing is faceless........will Sandor consider it to be any semblance of his brother, living or undead?Â  Thoughts like this are why I more lean toward any reunion between Sandor and what's left of Gregor will beÂ somewhat incidental to Sandor's involvement in the Jaime, Brienne, LS and Stark Girls situation/storylines, or somewhat incidental.Â  How does one fulfill vengeance, or justice, against a brother without a face?Â  Hmmm......and LOL.Â

OMG!!Â  Half of this stuff started out serious but with a comedy bent to it for me, but NOW......I'm picturing that little alien guy driving the big alien guy inside the big guys head, Men in Black style.Â  And, I'm LMAO inspite of the fact that the little guy dying was played up with a touch of sadness.Â 
Â 
I think there better be something under the helm, as I'm not liable to get these silly notions out of my head now, book or show wise.Â 


Â Yeah, or maybe he's really like a Russian Matryoshka doll, where every time you take a helmet off, there's a smaller helmet underneath! Until eventually there's a teeny tiny helmet about the size of a marble, and when you take that one off, its a tiny Danny DeVito, and he yells "I would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids!!"

I'd agree with that; Sandor fighting Frankengreg just doesn't seem like it would have the same emotional stakes. Also he's on the QI to repent for all his violence. Is he really going to get off and take up a quest to kill?
Â 
Overall, I'm kind of starting to want a Dark Helmet thing for RS:Â https://www.youtube....h?v=jTJq8co38Pk

I don't think it's about compatability for Sandor and LS, I think, moreso, The Hound will/may be a wildcard in getting Jaime and Brienne out of that messy situation.Â  I'm thinking more along those lines.Â  I'm all for dead Freys, but I do think LS has to go, in the long run.Â  I'm just hoping she learns most of her Cat's children are alive before she does.Â 


I like the way you think, m'lady.
2517	Seneti	2014-05-22	Wow, those last two pages of the thread were just... not sure if trolling or just WTF...
Â 


Also, more on RS, but keep in mind the quote "There were shadows all around them. One shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful. Over them both loomed aÂ giantÂ in armor made ofÂ stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick Â black blood."
Â 
Is Jaime going to be getting in involved somehow also? Or is it just like, because he's LC of the Kingsguard he'll have to deal with him (but not in battle).


Â 
I think it's more or less a demonstration of varying degrees of danger. We know that there are several shadows around the Starks in that vision, but we don't know if it's just those three or if there are more. Either way, all of those shadows are or were at one point instruments/allies of the crown and the Lannisters and thus a danger to the Starks. However, Jaime (at the end of ADWD) is no longer a sister-fucking, children-murdering bastard and the Hound is no longer working for the Lannisters, so compared to the Mountain, who remains a complete monster loyal to the crown, both Jaime and Sandor are minor threats. Hence the third shadow looming over the other two. At least that's my interpretation of that prophecy.
2518	Le Cygne	2014-05-22	This thread is cracking me up!But no, I don't think Sandor will fight Gregor, I think the point was, he never really wanted to kill him.(Sorry, make that UnGregor, which makes it even less likely, he's not even his brother anymore.)

Thrice Ned saw Ser Gregor aim savage blows at the hound's-head helmet, yet not once did Sandor send a cut at his brother's unprotected face.

2522	Le Cygne	2014-05-22	I stepped through that last chapter, what stands out is Arya had so many chances to leave him and so many chances to kill him, but never did. Instead, she followed him into danger, defended him, saved his life, took care of him, ... called him Sandor.They approach the inn. She says let's not go in, she senses danger is ahead, but he wants to go in anyway. She thinks she should leave, but instead, she follows him into danger:Â Arya would never have a better chance to escape... Then she led the horses to the stables, and went in after him.Inside, she knows there's danger, and again thinks they should leave, but she stays with him:Â We should go too, Arya knew.The Hound finds out what happened to Sansa and gets sloshed. Arya doesn't realize he's playing them, and thinks he's one of them, but still doesn't leave. A fight breaks out. She worries about him:Â He's drunk, Arya realized with dismay. He drank too much too fast, with no food in his belly.She doesn't run away, she defends him. A lot.Â They're killing him. Arya had no more cups, but there was something better to throw.She tries to kill the Tickler. She fatally wounds the squire. The Hound is badly injured. He kills Polliver. Then she kills the Tickler.The Hound is weak and she thinks she could just ride off, but she doesn't:Â ... I'll just leave him and ride off.She takes care of him. He passes out. Again she doesn't leave him. She finishes cleaning and dressing his wounds.She says the names on her list, but not the Hound. Then she calls him Sandor, and wonders why she left him off her list. Immediately after, she answers her own question - she's come to know him.Â Sandor moaned, and she rolled onto her side to look at him. She had left his name out too, she realized. Why had she done that? She tried to think of Mycah, but it was hard to remember what he'd looked like. She hadn't known him long.She thinks he should go back on her list, but she doesn't kill him. She stays with him. She takes care of him some more. And then she spells it out, she doesn't want to kill him. I wouldn't have to = not something she wants to do.Â I wouldn't have to kill him. If I just rode off and left him, he'd die all by himself.Then she thinks about Mycah, so she thinks maybe she should kill him. She pulls out Needle. He tells her to kill him. She doesn't. He tells her she's chicken and he tells her to kill him again. She still doesn't.Â His eyes opened. "You remember where the heart is?" he asked in a hoarse whisper.As still as stone she stood. "I ... I was only ...""Don't lie," he growled. "I hate liars. I hate gutless frauds even worse. Go on, do it." When Arya did not move, he said...Then he tries to goad her into killing him.And in the middle of it, he starts crying about Sansa. This is what he's been worried about the whole time, he brought it up with Sansa ("No one would hurt you again or I'd kill them") and then with Arya twice before ("I watched them beat your sister" and "I never beat your sister") and now this:Â He made a queer sound, and it took her a moment to realize he was sobbing. "And the little bird, your pretty sister, I stood there in my white cloak and let them beat her."Does she realize he loves her sister, maybe not, but something has to have gotten through, because she doesn't say a word about it.He tells her to kill him once again. She says he doesn't deserve mercy, but look at the reasons she gives for leaving:Â "You shouldn't have hit me with an axe," she said. "You should have saved my mother."He should have saved her life better after he risked his own life riding into a massacre for her (and he'd already saved her life another time, just before that), and he should have saved her mother's life, when there was nothing he could have done.

I'm not one to swear 100% to any theory, be it my own or someone else's, but the more I've just thrown out the wild speculation over the months, theorized on the fly, the more I think that Sandor not only will be involved somehow in the LS mess with Brienne and Jaime, the more I think it's a distinct possiblity that Sandor has already left the Quiet Isle, offpage. Â I don't subscribe to any theories 100%, not even R+L=J (only because I'd LMAO if GRRM changes his mind and doesn't do it), especially my own. Â But, I do think there is lots of logic in the idea.

I went with the benefit of the doubt, LOL, but I wonder. Â As far as the Brothers' Clegane, I do think that IF Sandor encounters Gregor again, dispatching him will be more about what is right in the end (and getting rid of an unholy monster is RIGHT) and a gift to all the realm, not something personal for himself.

Great analysis! I forgot what a heavy scene this was, and that Arya ultimately has no good reason for leaving/not giving him the gift. Is it because it's too hard for her to kill him? Or because she's so full of anger? Just fantastic, and I hope they do it justice.

Even if they've changed Sandor's character (a whole lot), I think they are fond of him, hence Arya/The Hound getting all of Brienne and Pod's good moments. So they'll probably want to do his "death" (or at least semi-permanent departure) justice. Maybe I'm just being optimistic, though.

I'm with you, I have a hard time figuring out the plotting of a Hound vs UnGreg, not to mention.........getting any type of payoff even IF it meant as much to Sandor to settle accounts with him as it once did.

2532	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-22	All this future spec on Sandor and Brienne as allies, though, does lead me back to the worry that D&D could mess it up with something on the show right now, LOL Â Maybe GRRM has already trolled them?

Â 
Â 
The more I think about it, the more certain I become of seeing Sandor again for both the books and show. Â I do think both Stark girls could be a trigger for him, granted Sansa being the bigger of the two. Â I have to wonder if the fact that we are lacking claims of a dead Sansa, still, will be enough to trigger Sandor's exit from the Isle. Â The fact that Lady Brienne may be the truest knight out there and has come so close to his path in itself seems important to me, something that will be further explored. Â That, along with even UnCat. Â If Sandor should suspect LS's identity (just from info that hits the Quiet Isle), I can see him hearing Arya's voice full of recrimmination.......you should have saved my mother, etc. Â I wonder what Sandor would think is the right thing to do for Arya's mother? Â All of these scenarios are just ripe with possibilties.
Â 
Here's a query, though, about the show. Â Do you, or anyone else reading this, think that D&D might do the Sandor send off without him learning about Sansa's marriage and flight?

Â 
Hmmmmmmmmm., I guess time will tell. Â
2535	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-22	Honestly I think it's a very plausible theory. It would be a pretty big coincidence that Brienne stops by the place Sandor's hiding while on a quest to look for none else than Sansa Stark. There's a fair chance he's overheard/somehow learned about it and decided to follow her.
Â 
Also, Brienne/Jaime/Sandor are what dreams are made of.
Â 
And GRRM trolling everyone about R+L=J would be the most delightful thing in the world.


Â 
Yeah, I can't help it, that's my touch of evil showing through. Â  
Â 
The dream team possiblities of Brienne, Jaime, and Sandor do tend to just help give my theorizing on the fly life of it's own. Â It's not even difficult......there are just tons of possibilities between the three and all the people and issues they have in common. Â

2536	Chebyshov	2014-05-22	He kept insisting she kill him, and she didn't want to, and she was a sitting duck staying there, she had to leave. But I love the excuses she came up with.


Â 
Yup, it's fantastic, even when he was essentially goading her into doing it (your little Michael). And her forcing herself to say his name again...
Â 


Also, Brienne/Jaime/Sandor are what dreams are made of.


Â 
Which is why the show has to keep Sandor's death ambiguous. If this is a possible encounter later in the series, they will jump at that. You know how fond they are of odd pairings.
Â 
Â 


The more I think about it, the more certain I become of seeing Sandor again for both the books and show. Â I do think both Stark girls could be a trigger for him, granted Sansa being the bigger of the two. Â I have to wonder if the fact that we are lacking claims of a dead Sansa, still, will be enough to trigger Sandor's exit from the Isle. Â The fact that Lady Brienne may be the truest knight out there and has come so close to his path in itself seems important to me, something that will be further explored. Â 


Â 
Love that; never even thought about it before.
2537	Petyr Patter	2014-05-22	The more I think about it, the more certain I become of seeing Sandor again for both the books and show.

I'm the opposite, the more I think about it, the more certain I become that Sandor has been written out of the narrative.Â  True, Martin does leave numerous deaths ambiguous only to later reveal the character still alive.Â  Davos comes to mind, as does Theon.Â  However, there is not a lot of ambiguity when it comes to Sandor.Â  He asked Arya to kill him because his wound was "unhealable."Â  Later, we have an eye witness to his 'death' say he tried to help the man, but he died anyways.Â  He then proceeded to bury him.Â  At this point, letting Sandor live is the equivalent of lying to ones readers to shock them later, an amateur writing trick that Martin tries to avoid.Â 
Â 
Then, there is the entire theme of Feast of Crows.Â  This book is almost a morality tale about the horrors of war, regardless of the nobility of its cause.Â  Sandor embraced a philosophy he learned cruelly from his brother, that strength and violence are the only truths.Â  He made himself the strongest and one of the most feared killers in Westeros.Â  Yet, on the Blackwater he became a broken man.
Â 
Like an alcohol addict, there really is no way to go back to the happy times when the vice didn't destroy one's ability to function in society.Â  Martin, with his emphasis on unavoidable consequences, might just have written Sandor one of the few "happy" endings possible for somebody whose killed his share of innocents, including a good portion of the Stark household.Â 
Â 

Here's a query, though, about the show. Â Do you, or anyone else reading this, think that D&D might do the Sandor send off without him learning about Sansa's marriage and flight? Â Rorge just happened to mention that Joffrey was dead, nothing else. Â I'm not sure I can see a way for him and Arya to find out about these things without running into Brienne and Pod.

Hard to say. I think with the Sandor and Sansa relationship framed as "non-romantic" in the show, because otherwise that would be creepy, knowing Sansa's fate doesn't warrant a mention in the limited time the show has. For example, there was never a scene where Sansa is told what happened to Bran and Rickon. She mourns Robb and Catelyn's death, but not her other brothers.
On the otherhand, knowing Sansa's fate would definitely be a HUGE moment for Arya, as it leads her to believe she is the last Stark. So I think they will include it for that character if not the other.
2538	RavenKing23	2014-05-22	Umm, I hate to be the debby downer but why would the Hound work with Jaime and Brienne? He could just as easily (and far more likely) believe Jaime is full of shit and try to kill the pair if he hears that they are looking for Sansa.
As for Robert Strong, that is a fight he has to do on his own. The Elder Brother was wrong, there is no way Sandor can let go decades of fear and hatred, even if he lived to be a hundred. 
I hope the gravedigger is true and Sandor still has a part to play, but I don't think he's long for this (that?) world. His peace will be his death
2539	Newstar	2014-05-22	The thrilling thing about the Hound this season is that if he doesn't clearly die, that will be a spoiler as to his future role in the books, and if he does die, then that will be a spoiler as well (that he never returns in the books to do anything of significance). Either way, we're getting spoiled.
The end of Season 4 is going to be a bloodbath, in between Lysa, Oberyn, Tywin, Ygritte, Shae, maybe some named characters dying at the Wall who don't in the book, etc. It would be ballsy of the writers to tack on yet another death to that if the Hound actually dies.

Â 
I'm not looking at Jaime as the main motivation for moving Sandor in that storylines direction. Â As I've already said, I'm not a person who thinks they have all the answers to the story, but I can see many angles that would fit Sandor into this part of the narrative. Â , I'm looking at Brienne and her quest in relation to the Stark girls, and the fact that the quest may not be as hopeless as Sandor may have thought previously, just as his health may not have been as hopeless as Arya might have thought. Â It's more so the women, the right thing, and KNIGHTHOOD and the meaning such things hold for Sandor that make me wonder about it

Â 
I'd be happy to answer further in a bit (RL and all creeps in it's petty pace), but I'm not one who thinks that all of Sandor's feelings have to be about romance, more importantly, any actions done or tried on Sansa's behalf don't have to be performed with the expectation of anything other than........doing something for someone he deeply cares about. Â 
Â 
That's all I got for now, LOL Â
2542	Blazfemur	2014-05-22	Sandor will NOT be returning for the fight of Ser Robert Strong vs Margaery's champion. If he returns, it wont be so soon. Hardly enought ime to rehabilitate. Hardly enough time to heal, both physically, and mentally. If he returns, it'll be in A Dream Of Spring in a more triumphant stature. He sure as hell wont be the "holy paladin" everyone hopes he becomes, he'll have to same attitude, the same anger, but it'll be more focused and better placed.
Â 
ETA: IF he returns, it'll be a sudden shock return. It'll be under a new helmet that covers all his face, and it'll be in a Sansa chapter, saving her from something, probably soemthing Petyr Baelish created. He'll remove his new helmet, and it'll be him.

The return of The Hound, no, Sandor Clegane, is one of the most anticipated moments for me to come in the last two books. I dont think it'll happen in TWOW, because not enough time has passed. So i wont be too distraught if we dont get him there.
Â 
...but he HAS to return. I'll boycott GRRM for the remainder of his years, if Sandor doesnt achieve the high point of his character arc.

2547	Nick_Scryer	2014-05-22	I hope you guys are all correct about Sandor ^

The thing I REALLY want from ASOIAF at this point is for Sandor to be alive and for:
Â 
Jaime, Brienne and Sandor somehow to join up for some epic scenes.Â 
Sandor Clegane overcoming his fear of fire, either using a flaming sword to kill unGregor, rescuing Sansa from a wildfire burning King's Landing or killing a Dragon.

Though, D&D, and inevitably GRRM, are TOTALLY fucking trolling us! The scene with the chickens in the inn, he lives unscathed, Arya attempts to IMPALE him with needle, watching it for the first time i was like  , but no, unscathed.

I hope they didn't mean SandorÂ but the suspect had crossed my mind... He will be out of the events for 2 (or more) books, if his future role is not THAT big andÂ irreplaceable, they could prefer to cut him outÂ

Could be Grenn. Someone apart from the wildlings has to die to give that episode the oomph it needs, one would think.
2552	Blazfemur	2014-05-22	think of it though, it'd be brilliant, and it would showcase sandor MORE, if they killed him ont he show, but he returns IN the books in ADOS. It'd be that much more of a "HOLY FUCK HES BAAAAAAAACK!!!! HAHAHA"

2554	Newstar	2014-05-22	Another reason why it's unlikely to be the Hound is that the Hound is not clearly still alive in the books, so I doubt they'd spoil that in an interview.

His name was mentioned by various characters throughout ADWD, and their names were mentioned together, too.Also what would be the point of all of these scenes, they included a lot of the book story.Future volumes thing I was speculating about:You will see, in A STORM OF SWORDS and later volumes, that Sansa remembers the Hound kissing her the night he came to her bedroom... but if you look at the scene, he never does. That will eventually mean something, but just now it's a subtle touch, something most of the readers may not even pick up on.http://www.westeros....rtells_and_More

Â 
I have to say, I haven't a clue, biased or otherwise, about any romantic future for Sansa and Sandor, but I think there are so many story angles for him, Sansa included. Â He can still have story that interacts with Sansa regardless of the outcome on that point. Â 
Â 
Some of the ideas I threw out here on this thread are probably the result of too many rereads, but all of those rereads have helped me delve deeper into the story, and even without any bias, I see so many places where Sandor could reemerge on the scene and fit in perfectly. Â 
Â 
I have many favorites in characters, families, and factions.....I don't speculate based on my biases (or try not to do so), until it comes to Roose Bolton. Â I want him to live, not win......just live, the bonus would be with Fat Walda and the coming baby. Â I do understand though, some will base speculation on narrow biases. Â If I ever feel like I'm doing that, I'd say so.

I dont know if this was the thread, or another one, where i included my predictions for the "perfect ending." actually no, i just found it. this is in fact complete fan fiction, but this would be it for me:
Â 
They looked off into the horizon, the sun rising in the distance over the snow-capped mountains. The wind howled through them, breathing through their clothes and tugging at their cloaks.
Â 
"Gettin' a bit chilly, little bird" he said.
"Oh, I don't think it's that bad," she replied.
Â 
He twisted his gnarled, burned face, scoffing her insolence, draping an arm across her shoulders. She gazed back at him, with glowing, icy blue eyes.
Â 
"Winter has finally come" he said.
"And it's here to stay" she replied, her pale lips finally touching his.
Â 
Â 
Now, there's your Ice, there's your Fire. There's your balance. Winter overcomes, and Spring is just a dream.

Â
2558	~No One~	2014-05-22	I'm with you, I have a hard time figuring out the plotting of a Hound vs UnGreg, not to mention.........getting any type of payoff even IF it meant as much to Sandor to settle accounts with him as it once did. Â It's just.....weird. Â I think you hit the important part of any Sandor equation and that is either of the Stark girls, and I suspect he would have interest in Brienne's quest. Â Not to mention, I find it ironic that Lady Brienne may be the truest representation of a knight, and with Sandor's knightly issues I think it'd be really something for them to meet as allies.

Oh, nice! I thought I was on my own thinking he was at the end of his Gregor-hatred arc.
I do think there's nice symmetry that both brothers "die", but only one finds peace. In many ways, their lives have been mirrored, until Sandor finds his Stark "triggers".
To the poster who mentioned a Jamie/Brienne/Sandor reunion? Um, yes, I would like to subscribe!
2559	Le Cygne	2014-05-22	I do understand though, some will base speculation on narrow biases. Â If I ever feel like I'm doing that, I'd say so.

Â Â geographically, right now. Â  No worries about biases, you always seem to think in terms of the text. I am the same way, I want the story he's telling, but if it's there, and I like it, I am going to enjoy it.I have a feeling nothing will end well for anyone. For Sansa and Sandor, I figure it's safe to think a kiss will happen, so much buildup and there's so much more.There's too much romantic stuff in their story, layers upon layers, plus it's following Beauty and the Beast faithfully. It's just so much there, that's why people see it.Still laughing about the geographic area stuff.

Â

On the otherhand, knowing Sansa's fate would definitely be a HUGE moment for Arya, as it leads her to believe she is the last Stark. So I think they will include it for that character if not the other.


Â 
Being as I said I'd try and address this post when I had more time, here goes. Â I've done my big typing for the day, I think, but here goes.
Â 
I can't disagree with some of your points about AFFC, but as far as Sandor goes, I do. Â He may have broke on the Blackwater, but I think he saw getting Arya to her mother and brother as a chance at a new life for himself, if possible. Â That trip was as much for him as it was for Arya. Â The Blackwater and his fear of fire broke his dishonorable ties to the Lannsiters, I think he was looking for honor with Robb Stark. Â I don't see him as an alcoholic who can't go back thanks to his brother's death.....I see him as a man learning to move past it, whatever happens in the future with UnGregor. Â IF he should be the one to rid the world of Frankengreg, it'll be because it has to be done, it'll be symmetry. Â It may also be his way to repay the Faith for taking him in and nursing him back to health, inside and out. Â 
Â 
I think Sandor saw his chance at being a good man to be tied to that chance to swear his sword to Robb. Â It was Sansa and Arya and his time with each of them that made it seem possible. Â Brienne being the one to come to the Quiet Isle looking for answers about them and Sandor being there and the knighthood issues they have in common could be as important as the Stark sisters themselves to Sandor's story.
Â 
I'm not saying he'll live happily ever after, with or without Sansa or anyone else for that matter, I'm saying I see lots of places he can fit into the storyline, and I don't think GRRM is done with him. Â Not for nothing does it seem that there's lots going on in Sandor's latitude now, and if Dany's visions meant anything.........the final battle may wind up in the Riverlands, too. Â There are many places and points for Sandor to still play a part, a big part, in the story.
Â 
As far as Sandor and Sansa and the show........and whether or not it's important that he find out about Sansa's marriage, I don't think it matters how much of a romantic or sexual slant their characters had or didn't have together on the show, what matters in those circumstances are the deep feelings between the two. Â The show doesn't HAVE to do it exactly the same as in the book, but it's still important, even to Show Sandor, to know and react to what he thinks was Sansa's fate with Tyrion and flight from him and KL.

2562	Blazfemur	2014-05-22	Wow, that's nice! And I thought I was the romantic one. What do you see for Arya's future?


Â 
unfortunately, i see Jon's foreshadowing coming to pass =/
Â 
"sooner or later, theyre gonna find you when spring comes, with a needle frozen in your hand" or something to that effect. its when he gives her needle, and she's sewing in the first book.
Â 
i think arya dies, her being has no purpose but revenge. she doesnt contribute much to the story other than losing herself, and becoming no one. her entire life is defined by her want for revenge.
Â 
think about it, let's just say her storyline does do her good, and she ends up killing the last one on her list.....ok. then what?
Â 
i dont get a good vibe from her storyline, to be honest.
2563	Blazfemur	2014-05-22	im going to go out on a limb, and say, she's going to be the one, to put Lady Stoneheart, to rest. Lady Stoneheart's very existence, is based around revenge, with the idea that all her children are dead.
Â 
Let's say lady stoneheart meets arya, would arya even be wearing her own face?
Â 
lady stoneheart's character arc NEEDS to be put to rest, and to do that, she needs to let go of the past. seeing arya alive, may do that. arya gets the mercy kill, killing her own "mother" mercifully as the lady allows it.
Â 
thats how i see her storyline going eventually.
Â 
ETA: theoretically, if you think about it, there's your fookin Azor Ahai shoe-in as well. the lady's life force is a supernatural determination of R'hllor, is it not? The magic that keeps her alive, and her spirit, transfers into needle, making it catch flame. BAM, Arya Ahai!

2564	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-22	Could be Grenn. Someone apart from the wildlings has to die to give that episode the oomph it needs, one would think.


Â 
I've seen and heard this spec., too, about someone extra dying this season, and have seen the spec on it being Grenn. Â I like both characters, both mediums, and I'm really worried about Grenn. Â Maybe it is Baby Boy Clegane I should be worried about in relation to the show, I just think D&D have put too much into him this season for it just to be the extra death. Â We'll see soon. Â I don't want to lose Grenn either, but he is the one I suspect is probably going. Â I might laugh if it's neither of them that bites it, but I can't easily pick out another possiblity. Â

2566	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-22	Oh, nice! I thought I was on my own thinking he was at the end of his Gregor-hatred arc.
I do think there's nice symmetry that both brothers "die", but only one finds peace. In many ways, their lives have been mirrored, until Sandor finds his Stark "triggers".
To the poster who mentioned a Jamie/Brienne/Sandor reunion? Um, yes, I would like to subscribe!


Â 
I do think there could still be something with the brothers, but it might be with Sandor just putting his brother's body parts to rest.Â  It'd be interesting to see what Sandor's feelings would be should he learn that his brother continues in some form.Â  I'm also thinking that he may consider it a debt to the Seven to put UnGregor down, or at least, a debt to the Elder Brother.Â  This alone shows how there could be more to address with Sandor.Â  Interesting observation about both being thought to be dead, but each surviving in different ways.
2567	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-22	Nice post, agreed, it's important he finds out about it.

Â 
Thanks for the first part, if I think I hit on any of my biases, I will try and notice and admit it, LOL
Â 
I have to put out a little hope for my girl Arya.Â  I find hope in the rehabilitation of child soldiers and that parallel for her story, but I also think that her saving of Needle was important, and all her thoughts when she did so.Â  Interesting thought, considering we are at the point in the show now where it's only recently that she has recovered Needle.Â  It will be OH SO INTERESTING for Arya's story if and when more news of any of her siblings reach her.Â  I'm wondering about her reaction to any news about Jon, assassination attempts and survival and all, and more importantly, where she might be if such news should reach her.Â  LS's need for........closure could figure into changing Arya and her views and actions on The Gift of Death.Â  Although, The Kindly Man has a point about there not being a people who live forever, nor should there be.Â  That could be a catalyst for Arya.Â 
Â 
Not sure if this should be spoilered for MERCY, but here goes:
Â 

	Spoiler  While I did get a kick out of Arya dragging Raff hand in hand, gleefully, to his own death, I can't say it didn't make me a bit scared for her.

Â 
My main bias problem is I have faith that many characters can survive, and I look for ways for many to survive, that could be my biggest bias.Â  I can see with Arya, it might be a stretch, but I'm not out of hope yet.Â  She doesn't know how much family she has left, and went to Braavos because of the hole in her heart, I try to remember that.Â

The reason(s) for this is that her arc is not anywhere near finished...she won't die without at least crossing off - or out-living - several (all?) of the names on her list. 
There's also been such heavy foreshadowing of a reunion with both Jon and Sansa. Not so for Rickon or Bran, coincidentally.
ETA: also with Nymeria. As long as Nym's got a pack, Arya's got a pack.

Â 
From what I understand, we may have GRRM's wife on our side?Â  I hope that's a bonus on our part.Â  My above post about the Mercy chapter just sent me to reread it.Â  I've been meaning to do that the past few days.Â  I miss that girl.Â  I think she has more chance and more options than some think.Â  I hadn't really thought about the lack of foreshadowing for her and her younger brothers and whether or not that has something to do with her own belief that they are dead.Â  I'm always trying to figure out the angle for Arya in relation to Nymeria and her pack.Â  Arya surrounded by other killers, or just.......others with commonality.Â  Does Nymeria's penchant for picking up so many wolf friends just equate with all the friends Arya makes as herself and as No One?Â  Does it mean Arya will lead a pack of......something?Â  I usually just get lost in the many possibilities and don't come up with just one answer.Â  Maybe that bodes well for Arya, too.Â
2570	Newstar	2014-05-22	The Mercy chapter convinced me that Arya will die, actually. Not soon, but before the end of the books. I'd sort of thought that Arya was heading in that direction no matter how many tried still tried to argue that she was an adorable little badass on a righteous mission of justice, but to see it actually realized was truly crushing in a way. I'd sort of gone back and forth before the Mercy chapter, but I remember that the death foreshadowing for Arya dying and dying young is laid on really thick in AGOT, which is where I think GRRM put most of the truly important foreshadowing. I believe she'll reunite with Jon--since the show spoiled that Melisandre and Arya will meet, suggesting a trip to the Wall for Arya--but her reunion with Jon, like all reunions in this book between characters who have or had any sort of love or esteem for each other (Jaime/Tyrion with their relationship irrevocably ruined within, like, 10 minutes, Catelyn/Brienne with Brienne swiftly hanged by a vengeful Stoneheart, Jaime/Brienne with Brienne lying to her beloved Jaime to lead his doom while Jaime trustingly trots along after her, Jon/Ygritte with Ygritte dying before Jon's eyes, Theon/Asha with Asha shocked by her brother's condition, Jaime/Cersei with their relationship deteriorating at a shocking speed after their reunion, etc.), will be unspeakably horrible. Count on it. The more supposedly loving or romantic the relationship, the more horrifyingly awful their reunion...which is why all you SanSan shippers better hope they stay the hell away from each other.
Â 
On another note, about Arya's survival prospects, I think GRRM will kill off one more Stark (for realsies), and that it will be either Sansa or Arya, as they're "expendable" in ways that Jon (possible saviour/endgame king of Westeros), Bran (demigod) and Rickon (male heir to inherit Winterfell and continue the Stark line) are not. I mean, Arya and Sansa are awesome special snowflakes and all, but if they dropped dead in their next chapter, it wouldn't be the downfall of Westeros or the effective extinction of House Stark in the male line. Their existence might be convenient--Arya can assassinate someone important, Sansa can funnel Vale supplies to the North--but it is not essential. At the same time, I doubt GRRM would kill off both girls while leaving the remaining male Starks alive, so if one dies, then the other will live, and vice versa. They won't survive together, and they won't die together, either. I'm reminded of Ned's "duality" imagery from AGOT: sun/moon, two sides of the same coin, etc. Either she or Sansa will make it out of this series alive. My money's on Sansa to survive, for the moment, which in my mind leaves Arya out (in addition to the Mercy chapter and the AGOT foreshadowing). (I doubt I'm the only one who thinks this might be the case, which might be one reason the "Sansa will die" and "Arya will die" discussions can get so heated. The fans might have sensed the truth: one of them's gotta go! Who's it going to be?)

Or Thorne, as a replacement for Noyle, since he doesn't seem to do much in the future books anyways.
2572	~No One~	2014-05-23	Newstar, that's a really great analysis. So, cheers.
I think the vast majority of people think Arya will kick the bucket before the end, despite being George's wife's favourite. I tend to agree that GRRM wouldn't compromise the story - even for his wife! 
However, I think there has been heavy foreshadowing since the beginning (agree that in AGOT it is extremely significant) at Arya and Sansa meeting again. They've each "forgiven" the other in their own way. I wouldn't be surprised to see them together, in some capacity, before the end. 
WRT Jon, I also think you are on to something with the fact that their reunion might not be all it's cracked up to be, but my money is on Jon dying, not Arya. Mostly because Arya is my favourite. Not a strong argument, I know. 
I do not see Arya meeting back up with the Hound, if he indeed features again. Their time together served its purpose for both. What Sandor needs to do is find Sansa. I hope this happens. And as much as I love Sansa (a lot!), I'd rather have her die than Arya. 
But I'm going to have to disagree that Rickon is indispensable...I think it would be trope-flip-worthy that Sansa becomes Lady of Winterfell. In fact, Rickon dying would be terrible news for the Manderlys, Davos, Stannis, and all the North. Seems just like what a certain sadistic writer we know would do 
ETA: grammar nitpicks

Â 
I don't place any weight on GRRM's wife's attachment to Arya in terms of enhancing her survival prospects. GRRM's very proud of writing a series where anyone can die and no one, not even Arya, is safe.
Â 
Â

Â 
GRRM has said Arya and Sansa have issues that they need to work out...which doesn't mean, of course, that they will wind up doing so. I do think that an Arya/Sansa reunion might fare better than some of the other horrible reunions I listed upthread, simply because they were never that wild about each other anyway compared to the way Jon and Arya desperately miss each other.
Â 
Jon and Arya, on the other hand, have one of the sweetest, warmest, most loving, most touching relationships in ASOIAF...so you can only imagine how fucked up shit is going to get when they reunite. 
Â 
Â 
WRT Jon, I also think you are on to something with the fact that their reunion might not be all it's cracked up to be, but my money is on Jon dying, not Arya. Mostly because Arya is my favourite. Not a strong argument, I know. 
Â 
Could be. If Jon is not intended to do anything else after he helps save Westeros or whatever, I could see him dying. His very dramatic "death" at the end of ADWD makes me think GRRM won't pull the same trick twice, though.
Â 
Â 
I do not see Arya meeting back up with the Hound, if he indeed features again. Their time together served its purpose for both. What Sandor needs to do is find Sansa. I hope this happens. And as much as I love Sansa (a lot!), I'd rather have her die than Arya.
Â 
Heh, me too. If I had to pick between Sansa and Arya a la Sophie's Choice, Sansa would get the axe without question.
Â 
Â 
But I'm going to have to disagree that Rickon is indispensable...I think it would be trope-flip-worthy that Sansa becomes Lady of Winterfell. In fact, Rickon dying would be terrible news for the Manderlys, Davos, Stannis, and all the North. Seems just like what a certain sadistic writer we know would do 
Â 
I don't think Sansa is going to wind up as anything of Winterfell: lady, regent, castellan, scullery maid, anything. That ship sailed the moment her wolf died and/or the moment Ned Stark died, as far as I'm concerned. GRRM has refused to absolve Sansa of bearing partial responsibility for Ned's demise, which means no Winterfell or any Stark goodies for her: it wouldn't do to have an endgame lord/lady of Winterfell who had had a hand in Ned Stark's death. Whatever shenanigans Rickon gets up to on Cannibal Island, he is innocent of any part in the death of Ned Stark and is therefore not permanently "tainted" as Sansa is. Furthermore, GRRM has also refused to absolve Sansa of bearing responsibility for Lady's death, and he has hinted at possibility of Sansa no longer being a Stark by virtue of losing her wolf. There must be a Stark in Winterfell, and if Sansa is no longer truly a Stark because of Lady's death, a death for which GRRM believes she bears responsibility, well...
Â 
As for Rickon, I think the only possible point of his existence is to be the "spare" male to carry on the Stark line. That pretty much every line in his tearful farewell to Bran in 3x09 of the show--insisting he needs to protect his older brother Bran (anxious to protect his family, even those who are supposedly supposed to protect him, check), stressing that he wasn't a southerner (proudly claims his northern identity and rejects any possibility of being a southerner, check), and telling Osha he knows how to use a sword (warrior badass in the making, check)--screamed "Future Lord of Winterfell in the house" sealed the deal in my mind, not to mention Bran being all "YOU HAVE TO SURVIVE, YOU ARE THE HEIR TO WINTERFELL (in case anything happens to me)." Add on that the fact that GRRM let Liam Cunningham (Davos) in on a "pretty cool" secret about TWOW that Cunningham seemed pretty pumped about--a secret I doubt is "Davos' mission to rescue Rickon is fruitless and/or Davos dies in the attempt"--and I think Book Rickon is going to come roaring back in a big way. One of GRRM's favourite themes is the forgotten underdog who was never in the hunt barreling out of nowhere to take it all: that's how TPATQ turned out, and GRRM has supposedly said that that's how the fight for the Iron Throne will end with someone "unexpected" on it (meaning in all likelihood Jon or one of the Baratheon bastards legitimized)...although even if he never said it, TPATQ suggests that that's what he's going to do. Sansa's been treated as the heir to Winterfell by various parties who have no idea Rickon's still alive and has believed herself to be the heir to Winterfell for a while now, meaning she'll never get her hands on it. Not to mention LF's elaborate plan--which like all elaborate plans in ASOIAF is doomed to fail--has at its heart Sansa reclaiming Winterfell, meaning it will never happen.

Â 
As I've said before, I'm not sure about much of anything, and I like it that way.Â  Sometimes, I think many of us are just too primed for the idea of mass characterÂ murder and just try to be ready for it.Â  Other than that, without more caffeine, I'm not that wordyÂ this morning yet.Â Â Every time I give thought to the musical chair game of which Stark must go.........I'm at a loss for it, usually.Â  When it comes to Winterfell, I'm still of the mind that Bran needs to NOT be a tree for the rest of his life (watching others live is not a life, even if Bran needs to be a tree for now), and I continually throw him back into the Lord of Winterfell equation in my mind.Â

Â 
I keep looking for a possible extra death that isn't Grenn or the Hound, and I can't come up with one easily.Â  Maybe you have a point about Thorne, maybe it doesn't have to be a sympathetic character.Â  The actor playing Thorne is fabulous, though, I'm of the mind he needs Edd's awesome block fetching skills, too.Â  I can't quite figure out where they are going with Thorne.Â  I suspect he's staying and grumbling and plotting through Jon's LC run, though.Â  Maybe he'll be pulling a lot of the Bowen Marsh duty?Â 
Â 
Still, can't figure out the extra death, which reminds me.......am I the only one who was surprised at how quickly, easily, and STUPIDLY that Locke lost his life?Â  LOL and WTF??
2576	Newstar	2014-05-23	When it comes to Winterfell, I'm still of the mind that Bran needs to NOT be a tree for the rest of his life (watching others live is not a life, even if Bran needs to be a tree for now)
Â 
Maybe not for other people, but remember why Bran loved to climb? So he could get up high enough to survey everyone and everything from a distance. Being a tree, as awful as it may seem to us, might be giving something to Bran that he's always desperately wanted. That does seem to be part of ASOIAF: your deepest desires fulfilled, in the most horrible way possible. If someone had come up to AGOT Bran and told him "You can acquire the power to see through trees and see all kinds of things from a distance you never could, but the price is your legs, your home, your family, and any kind of human society," he probably wouldn't have made the deal, but that's true of most characters in ASOIAF who had to make similar tradeoffs.
Â 
Also, Bran already had a stint, admittedly a brief one, as acting Lord of Winterfell. GRRM doesn't tend to go backwards with characters.
Â

The show is not a book, they aren't constrained by the POV structure. If they need to show/hint where Sandor is,  they don't Brienne for that.
He may not be on Quiet Isle in the show, D&D aren't fond of rrligion, maybe he's somewhere else in/around Vale.
They're clearly doing away with Saltpants,  but he's a wanted man anyway.

Â 
I've been giving thought to the Bran analysis and the idea that GRRM doesn't tend to go backwards with characters (you've thought it out brilliantly, but I don't think I need to tell you that, but will anyway), and it's lead me to an observation and question of my own.Â  As you've pointed out, Bran has already been the acting Lord of Winterfell, and now he is the detached tree, a parallel to his climbing days.Â  What if it's now time for a third choice?Â  Would death be the only choice for a third option?Â  What if Bran were to try and go forward by going back.......to Winterfell, be it as Lord or just as a Stark?Â  Now I'm wondering if Bran's odds as the next, or only, dead Stark have risen?
Â 
I'm more of an Arya person than a Sansa person, but I'm not sure if either or both will or have to go.Â  I don't trust foreshadowing, necessarily, I don't trust GRRM (nor do I REALLY put much faith in his wife's preferences) either, as well......I think he has troll tendancies.Â  I mean that in a good way, if I didn't.......I wouldn't reread and rewatch the show, for both enjoyment and to try and figure it all out.Â

Also, isn't the Quiet Isle considered a stepping stone for Sandor, to meet with the High Sparrow and end up as Gregor's opponent in Cersei and Margs trial?
The way the show goes, that could be quite easily solved with a delirious, left for dead Hound being found, identified and nursed back to health by the soon to be High Sparrow on his way to Kings Landing. That would skip the QI entirely, while still maintaining the speculated flow of the story.

That would skip the QI entirely, while still maintaining the speculated flow of the story.


Â 
I don't want that repressed, power hungry High Sparrow to have that much influence on Sandor.Â  The Quiet Isle and The Elder Brother may be of The Seven, but I think they are worlds apart from the High Sparrow.Â  The Elder Brother seems a good man for the sake of being a good man, the High Sparrow on the other hand..........seems to be using religious zealotry to further his own ends along with repression.Â

Oh I am not going to debate you on that. I don't like religious fanatics at all.
However, many people think Sandor will be the champion of the faith and will face Frankenstein-Gregor who will champion for Cersei once again (since there are not really that many candidates for the faith champion I am firmly in the "eh, why not" camp on this one). Going from there it would be only logical to assume the then de facto leader of the faith would gain "access" to Sandor through the brothers of the Quiet Isle. Who says he leaves them any choice in that matter?

Â 
I do suspect that the show, at first, will just have Sandor disappear.....maybe they'll give us a hint of him at the QI or any old Sept in the Riverlands.Â  I suspect that IF, book or show, Sandor winds up as a champion of the Faith, it will be because of a man like Elder Brother, not a man like the High Septon.Â  Time will tell, I'm still not sure that any reunion of the Clegane Brothers won't be only a sidebar, anyway, on a slightly larger journey or mission for The Hound.Â  I find it very meaningful that Stranger was not castrated.Â  I think Sandor will be out and about again, he just needs to help put enough of the dead to a proper rest as The Gravedigger.Â

Not seeing how Sandor, just because he's rescued by someone kind, is suddenly a holy roller. He says all a man needs is a woman while looking at Sansa's breasts, names his horse, who refuses to be gelded, Stranger, cusses up a storm, but he's going to be a Lancel in a hair shirt or one of the soldiers like this (as Jaime described the Holy Hundred, who didn't distinguish themselves in battle)?Â [They] made a lovely sight as they wheeled and pranced their tall grey geldings. Littlefinger had once quipped that Ser Bonifer must have gelded the riders too, so spotless was their repute.Also, this is another good clue, Stranger (= Sandor, who is also the Beast in the story with Sansa) is apart from the other animals:Â Way down at the far end, well away from the other animals, a huge black stallion trumpeted at the sound of their voices and kicked at the door of his stall..."We had hoped gelding might improve the beastâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ill temper, butÂ  ..."

2584	Newstar	2014-05-23	Someone once observed that Sandor could be like those dudes who find religion in prison. Devout, but not to be fucked with. I could see it. Sort of like the High Sparrow, whose religious leanings interfere in no way with how dangerous he is. If the High Sparrow is representative of the new direction of the Faith, Sandor would fit right in.
Naming his horse after one of the Seven shows a certain level of irreverence from pre-QI Hound, but depending on how things turn out, it could well foreshadow him finding religion.

I keep looking for a possible extra death that isn't Grenn or the Hound, and I can't come up with one easily.Â  Maybe you have a point about Thorne, maybe it doesn't have to be a sympathetic character.Â  The actor playing Thorne is fabulous, though, I'm of the mind he needs Edd's awesome block fetching skills, too.Â  I can't quite figure out where they are going with Thorne.Â  I suspect he's staying and grumbling and plotting through Jon's LC run, though.Â  Maybe he'll be pulling a lot of the Bowen Marsh duty?Â 
Â 
Still, can't figure out the extra death, which reminds me.......am I the only one who was surprised at how quickly, easily, and STUPIDLY that Locke lost his life?Â  LOL and WTF??


Â 
I think Thorne dying would also make a lot of sense from a dramatic point of view. He has been at Jon's throat throughout the entire series, but Mance's attack is the moment when he is forced to admit that Jon was right. Having him die in that battle and handing command over to Jon (even if only temporarily, until proper elections can be held) would be a great way to finish his character arc.
2586	~No One~	2014-05-23	That's interesting. I never thought much about Stranger. 
I suppose in this story, that Arya isn't the only character to wear many faces. Sansa=Alayne, Theon=Reek (and vice versa, really), Wyman=Bolton-loyal, Jon=Wildling, fAegon=Aegon, Varys in general etc etc. the list goes on. It wouldn't be strange for Sandor to put on a face and become a devout sparrow. I'm skeptical of his involvement thusly, but it would fit thematically.

And actually I would love to read about it, written by an agnostic like Martin (and me) who has an outsider and yet very intense onlook on religion. It is indeed interesting that two of the most cynical dark or grey characters like Sandor and Tyrion are positioned with some link to religion, Sandor on the QI and Tyrion with the alias of Hugor Hill, quoting the Seven Pointed Star and having wanted to be a septon. These two for sure will - if Sandor is still present in the story - present quite a bit of the author's own approach to religion. Let's not forget that many religions do not include any monotheistic belief in a supernatural somewhat ominiscient powerful being but are more of a philosophical mindset, only to be demeaned by self appointed true religions as invalid. And a similiar approach would be far more fitting for those two cynics as failed romantics.
So I think Sandor on the QI might be a hugely interesting exercise in literature, and for that he can tend his lame leg, refrain from using weapons again and does not even need the karmic fight against his brother in order to have a satisfying ending.

Otherwise, what's the point of all the story time devoted to a horsey. And he loves Stranger. The priority order in the riot was, 1) Sansa, 2) Stranger, 3) Joffrey.Sandor = gravedigger. That's enough. That goes with his characterization to date.And I hate that I'm starting to appreciate the show more (damn) but I noticed after Arya got it right this time with Rorge (and all the same touches he did), they walked off side by side.

Â 
LOL, gotta try and appreciate the bits we can.Â  For me, Stranger not submitting himself to the Biggest Pair of Scissors EVAH should have meaning in regards to Sandor's true depth and immersion in religion.Â  Good points about the order of things during the riot.Â 
Â 
Sidenote:Â  I was so traumatized by the possiblity of Stranger losing his bits, it took awhile for the words to sink in and realize that he had successfully avoided the shears.Â  Then again, I may have been so busy agreeing with Hyle Hunt's take on the situation and his humor about it, that I was distracted momentarily.Â  Hunt did grow on me.Â
2590	Le Cygne	2014-05-23	I love Hyle Hunt, he grew on me, too. He championed Brienne to Randyll Tarly, what more can I say.

Â 
I did like how, for the most part and for himself, he tried to explain that he himself, and maybe some of the other men, were just young, dumb assholes when it came to the cruelty that hurt Brienne so much.Â  Granted, I'm paraphrasing and giving the words a modern twist, but that is what I felt he was trying to tell her.Â  I think he realizes how wrong it was, what they did to her, and I don't think he was as awful as some of the other men in the "Brienne Maidenhead Pool," and I appreciate both his realization and the fact that he wasn't one of the more awful ones to begin with.Â 
Â 
ETA:Â  To bring it around to the OT of Sandor and/or Arya, LOL, this would be a good place to point out, I don't hold out MUCH hope for Hyle Hunt showing up at all on my screen, but it would be nice......if he were around for some of the Quiet Isle action/show substitution and we could somehow have him encounter Sandor and Stranger, whether On Island, so to speak, or after.Â

2596	north of the wall	2014-05-24	Oh yay. I thought I was weird for liking Hyle Hunt! I would love to see him next season, however if Brienne meets LS ep 10 then I don't imagine him being introduced. There are so many more important characters being added I just can't see the justification budget wise to add Hunt which is a shame because I do love him.
2597	Elba the Intoner	2014-05-24	I don't think Arya has to die physically. There's been a few characters who have died in the metaphorical sense, including the Hound (he is dead while Sandor is "at rest.") GRRM is fond of doing this sort of "death."

I think Brienne was more disappointed in him than the others, she thought he was better than that. He made up for it, though, with Randyll Tarly, and ended up getting fired, basically, because he had enough of him. I would have loved to see Brienne's story in AFFC play out on screen, she's a great character...I hope Arya doesn't die, but I have never had much hope for a happy ending for anyone. I figure they get a moment with someone they love, then lose them, that's his definition of bittersweet. I think she'll go back for Needle one day, and head back to Westeros soon after. She's wants to be part of a pack at heart, she's killing those who wronged the ones she loved.
2599	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-25	^Even if Arya doesn't die, I don't see her getting an happy ending. I feel she's been through too much, is too scarred emotionally. That could be bittersweet, she reunites with (at least some) members of her family, but is unable to to reconnect with anyone (or something along those lines).
2600	Le Cygne	2014-05-25	Is there anyone you do see getting a happy ending?I'm at a loss to come up with anyone. I was more optimistic before the show. Has Jon Snow ever thought of Arya? I don't think so. Everyone who mattered to various characters in the books don't matter to them on the show, I can't even picture some little things happening for some.Then if I just think about the books, it all makes sense again. I would recommend to anyone to just do one or the other, watch the show or read the books, but don't do both.
2601	lostinasia	2014-05-25	Is there anyone you do see getting a happy ending?


I wouldn't be surprised if Walder Frey dies happy in his bed, at a ripe old age, content at a life well-lived and his goals fully realized. Martin could do that just to rub yet more salt in the wound.
Â 
I can see Sandor Clegane having a "happy" ending, living the rest of his days in the monastery in quiet repentance. Again, it'd be like Martin to play with the expectations here, Â and it would fit with tradition anyway - living the rest of their days quietly in a monastery wasn't an uncommon fate for knights in the medieval romances.Â If the "Clegane Bowl" does happen I'll be half gleeful and half cringing at the plot contrivances leading to such an event.
Â 
I'll be mildly surprised if Arya doesn't kill at least one Stark.
Â 
And I continue to be surprised at how well I remember the events of the first three books, and how poorly I remember Feast/Dance - I read them all in the space of a few months, three years ago I guess, but apparently my brain did not consider Feast/Dance memorable in the least. Hyle Hunt?! Even when I read the Wiki about him, it only rang the most muted of bells. Sandor's presence at the monastery seems to be the only thing I DO remember about all of Brienne's journeys.
2602	Le Cygne	2014-05-25	That's not happy for Sandor. Chatty guy, said all a man needs is a woman, cusses up a storm, and he spends the rest of his life mute, celibate, and saying prayers all day? That's hell.Who would want that? But the way he was characterized, he sure doesn't. There are people in the story who have done worse than him, and don't live out their days like that.And it doesn't go with the story, Stranger is raising hell for a reason...

"heroically In Sansa's arms" would indeed be a little cheesy but maybe for her and she may never know.
But I simply like the idea, as I wrote elsewhere, to see an approach by a less hypocrite character towards religion, written by an agnostic like Martin. And I could just as well see Sandor making a 180 degree turn from Lannisters' tool of oppression to someone fighting for commonfolk, either with arms or with conviction.

Â 
I'm not saying that Sandor's service to the Lannisters was all guard duty, but I wouldn't call him the Lannisters' tool of oppression, eithr, that would be his brother.Â  I'm not one who would want Sandor to end on the Quiet Isle (at least, not without emerging one more time first) and I'm not one who really thinks that Sandor and Sansa have a chance for much of anything, in endgames, anyway.Â  Love and respect and longing for each other, yes, but I'm not sure what else we will get in that Area?, you remember Area, right?....but that doesn't rule out him being able to do something worthwhile OFF ISLAND, be it for Sansa or for the larger scheme of things, and in the end, for himself.Â  I really do think Brienne, the closest thing to One True Knight, crossing his path could prove to be important and a clue for his re-emergence.Â  Plus, there's always his brother, or what's left of him.
Â 
Now, will Sandor have to pay with his life for coming Off Island, he might, but there are quite a few things that I think he would find worth the chance and a lot of those things are happening right around him.Â  If Stranger's bits bite the dust soon, then I might worry that Sandor is stuck there.Â  Could you see HIM as Elder Brother, I think he'd prefer the mute duty, LOLÂ

2613	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-25	By the way, for some reason, I went on a pic and gif hunt for Sandor and Arya, episode one of this season, Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner and all that.Â  Damn, that was fun.Â  I can't believe that this season is already almost over.Â
2614	Le Cygne	2014-05-25	Or Cersei is the ultimate SanSan fan. She's the one who ultimately put them together. Lena Headey said "He loves you" to Sansa during the Blackwater scene with Sandor, after all. Rather fitting.
2615	Conchobar	2014-05-25	Any chance it could be Sandor? He did lose what was left of his ear in the books and after his talk about the Lannisters having a bounty on his head, I wonder if he will run into Brienne. With her looking for him, Arya and Sansa and her being a Lannister associate attended by Tyrions squire, I could see things getting ugly quickly if they did meet. I Â hope it doesn't happen that way, but the show does throw characters together who never met in the books.


Nah too many main characters are just "bumping into each other" on the show, Rorge and Biter last episode, the Mountain's men in the first episode and Bran and Jon as well, this is a big country, it is very unrealistic for that to be happening in the show all of the time.

I don't expect a happy ever after - a tragic romance is more likely in both these cases... Sandor is my favorite character and I am convinced he has an important role to play after all the foreshadowing, but I would be very surprised if he survives the ending of the saga... I would rather expect him to go out with a bang... and it would be nice if he and Sansa did kiss and bang before that.  Before anyone asks, yes, in a few years time when Sansa is all grown up and knows what she wants, and she would be the one to initiate it, he'd probably be really surprised and confused as to what's going on: what? She really wants me? Someone predicted that, in his "second life" as Sandor Clegane, he will get to experience what the Elder Brother said he never did: price in service, joy in victory, loving and being loved (and this second life should not be focused on hatred of/killing Gregor!)... I hope that this happens, but I fully expect him to have a big death. But as Ygritte said, "All men must die. But first we'll live".
Â 
In any case, "singing to the Stranger, begging him for a kiss" is such an obvious wink from GRRM, I shouted and laughed when I first read it! Karmani recently caught an interesting connection in AGOT quotes, in this thread http://asoiaf.wester...22#entry5818201, which may be seen as foreshadowing:

Thanks, Le Cygne. My impression is that Sansa will act upon her willfulness, as she mistakenly did with Joffrey, based on the third, fourth and fifth paragraphs of the first Sansa chapter in GoT:
Â 
Septa Mordane sniffed in disapproval. â<U+0080><U+009C>A noble lady does not feed dogs at her table,â<U+0080><U+009D> she said, breaking off another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto her bread.
â<U+0080><U+009C>Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not a dog, sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a direwolf,â<U+0080><U+009D> Sansa pointed out as Lady licked her fingers with a rough tongue. â<U+0080><U+009C>Anyway, Father said we could keep them with us if we want.â<U+0080><U+009D>
The septa was not appeased. â<U+0080><U+009C>Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re a good girl, Sansa, but I do vow, when it comes to that creature youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re as willful as your sister Arya.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
While according to the Lannister patriarch in the same novel:
Â 
Can anyone say the same of the Hound? You feed your dog bones under the table, you do not seat him beside you on the high bench.
Â 
The similarity appeals to me.


Â 
Whether Sandor survives the end of the saga (which would surprise me) or not, they aren't going to get married - a lowborn marriage like that would screw up things for Sansa politically. I hope for some progress in Westeros, but that much would be a bit unrealistic, not so fast, anyway. I think she will never marry, like queen Bess - because she is politically savvy but she hates the idea of being in a political loveless marriage, and having power on your own is always better than relying on the power of your husband, especially since you're always subjected to him in the patriarchal society (something Arianne is not aware of, because she lacks the experience that Sansa or Cersei or Dany or other women outside of Dorne have had), though she may pretend she could accept various political suitors (something Bess also did until late in life). So, I don't think she'll "seat [Sandor or anyone] beside her on the high bench" but she will enjoy "feeding him under the table".  Which, whatever Septa Mordane says, ladies do... just not officially and as openly as the lords do...
Â 
(And if he dies [since I suspect Sansa to survive] any other relationships she may have later in life will, I believe, also be with someone she likes and who loves her for herself and who she doesn't marry, probably also someone relatively lowborn [compared to her at least - no political marriage to any of the great houses].)
Â 
This is pretty much how I see Sansa's personal future; what I'm not sure is regarding children - I think Sansa would want to have them; and actually, I can see her having at least one bastard child (it's thematically relevant with her playing Alayne Stone, modelling her on Jon, being fascinated by Ellaria Sand and Mya Stone) - but how would she deal with it regarding her reputation and political/social standing? Would there be false official parentage involved, once again in the series? Or could the customs of Westeros change so much... again, I'm not sure if the latter would be realistic...
2617	Le Cygne	2014-05-25	I see the story a bit differently, I don't think it's all that complicated.Â 
Â 
One interesting thing, the show has Sansa wearing dragonflies, necklace, ring, even embroidered on her corset. I did a search throughout the books and apart from observing that boats on the water were like dragonflies, the story references were about Jenny of Oldstones and the Prince of Dragonflies. They married for love:
Â 
Prince Duncan Targaryen loved Jenny so much he gave up his crown for her and married her against his father's wishes.

I've seen that theory before, but I'm a bit skeptical about the show foreshadowing things in such subtle ways. If it were in the books, I'd be more inclined to believe it.
Â 
Speaking of which, I don't remember if the song of Jenny and the Prince of Dragonflies was ever mentioned as one of Sansa's favorites in the books? I know that Catelyn mentions it and that she role played it with LF, and Arya hears it from Tom Sevenstreams, but I'm trying to remember if Sansa mentions it, in addition to her established favorites - Dragonknight and Queen Naerys, and Florian and Jonquil. She also mentioned a song about the twin brothers who fought each other during the Dance of the Dragons.

2619	Le Cygne	2014-05-25	I don't care about the show.The example is from the books, Jenny and the Prince of Dragonflies. That's where they got it from. Also there's Sansa's aunt, Lyanna, who spurned an arranged marriage and (perhaps) married for love, but at any rate, ran off with Rhaegar (that's what I think). Moreover, there's no one telling Sansa what to do, apart from her captor, who hopefully she'll shake at some point.Just seeing your edit, she does mention the song, and at any rate, it's one of the love songs in the story. It's an example of someone in Westeros who married for love.

@Cellio - It is true for the show - "Worlds are colliding!"
I'm the one with the Elder Brother's hints for Sandor - pride in service, joy in victory, to love and be loved, glory. 
How it winds up with Sansa, for the novels, I think it will continue playing by the Beauty and the Beast play book, a la GRRM. But I also think that he wants to see what would happen after the kiss and will write that. 
I think society is shifting in Westeros. I've been wondering who are the 'slaves' Dany will 'free' in Westeros if that's the show's limited perception. 
Tragic, doomed love is a Martin pet theme, but so is the hard truth. I see The Hound as facing that in his 'demise', his love for Sansa and the hatred of 'fraud' he sees in himself.

You are absolutely right, I should pay attention more to the direct quotes from Elder Brother, pride in service, and all the rest. Â Those are the point and counterpoint in Sandor's story, but seldom are they spelled out so simply. Â I'm liking the idea of paying direct attention to those lines. As we know, Elder Brother was a soldier himself, and it is his.......Area of expertise. Â

2625	Le Cygne	2014-05-25	That was the quote, worlds are colliding. I really don't want to see Sandor and Arya and Brienne and Pod bump into each other, the show is confusing enough at this point.Arya and the Hound are in the next episode, there's a still of Arya on the HBO site.

I agree, I can't see Sansa in a loveless political marriage: Ned wanted to break her betrothal and find "someone brave and gentle and strong" for her, regardless the fact that she would have lost the opportunity to become Queen, I think this foreshadowing is too strong 
I'm optimistic that after she has lost so much (more than anyone else) in the end GRRM will have something positive for her, and I'm with you on Sandor finding "pride in service, joy in victory, to love and be loved, glory"

I can't see Sansa in a loveless political marriage either, but that doesn't necessarily mean she will marry for love. There is an option of not marrying at all. Sansa was somewhat fascinated with Ellaria, who is a bastard and was never Oberyn's official wife but his paramour, even though they were more husband and wife than most of the married couples in Westeros and had four children together. And judging by her reactions to Mya Stone, she is not judgmental of women who have romantic/sexual relationships without being married.
2630	Karmarni	2014-05-27	Sansa was not judgemental of Myranda either. I definitely think sex is the controversial element in the Sansa chapter cut from ADWD.

Maybe she won't marry at all and I'm totally ok with that, I really like the parallel with Ellaria and Oberyn.Â I guess I should expect something like that, considering that I can't see her with anyone else but Sandor, and he doesn't strike me like someone who's glad to say the marriage vows in front of a Septon
2632	Le Cygne	2014-05-27	There's a ton of marriage symbolism and repetition in her story, though.  And it's all coming from Sansa herself...
There's the 1,000 times she dreamed of a tall strong man kissing her as he gave her his cloak in marriage.  She thought of Sandor when she was forced to marry someone she didn't want, and she refused to kneel for his cloak (and calls that a mockery of a marriage).  But she put Sandor's cloak on herself, twice.  
First time, in the throne room, GRRM needed a reason for Sandor to give it to her,  so her dress is torn off, and she thinks no velvet felt so fine as she clutches it against her bare chest.  But she'd been observing his cloak all along, since the beginning, the color, the clasp, the way he wore it...
Second time he gives it to her, she chooses to put it on for no reason other than she wants to...  there were lots of other nicer options if she was cold than a stinky bloody cloak.  And she finds it, as though she was looking for it. Then she remembers again and again.  
His cloak comes up during the rescue, and then when she pretends they kissed, and she remembers it as bloody, red on white, consummation symbolism.  And she places him in the marriage bed, because of how he kissed her, or how she imagines he did...
She keeps his cloak in a cedar chest, with her summer dresses. GRRM is of the generation where hope chests lined with cedar were given to young women to keep things for when they were married.  One day, the long winter will pass, and that's hope.  Like when Arya hid Needle under a rock.  And it's the gesture that matters, she doesn't need Needle to remember Jon.
More marriage stuff, Sansa tries to read Sandor's face when he says he has no wife... he asks what wife when he hears she had to marry someone else...  dismay at the thought no one would marry her for love, etc.  I'm probably forgetting some, but lots of detail showing marriage matters to her.

yes I know, and that's why I'm 100% sure that she will end up with Sandor 
In my opinion though, they can be married even without being formally married, if he can be her true knight while he's "no Ser" 
Even though she was forced to marry the Imp, her vows meant nothing to her... So I don't think a ceremony counts much, it doesn't make true relationships, no more than it makes true knights 
(I must confess I would find it even more romantic and meaningful if Sandor became her actual husband without any ceremony)
Â 
ETA: As Annara Snow wrote
Ellaria, who is a bastard and was never Oberyn's official wife but his paramour, even though they were more husband and wife than most of the married couples in Westeros and had four children together
I find this very romantic... no need for ceremonies or a piece of paper, they were in love, and that's what truly counts and what truly makes a couple

2640	Woman of War	2014-05-28	Actually in the series the most important character around Sandor's story so far is Arya and Sansa was the sideline. Arya and Sandor are equals if not in physical but in mental power. She gets the important confessions, she gets his fear of fire, she sees him emotionally naked. Arya mirrors his character development as he mirrors hers. This is not the absurd buddy comedy anymore as it started out at KFC Inn, this turns into tragedy. And the tragedy happens with Arya and will maybe end with her.

Â 
I agree that alot of the all around character develop of Sandor, show wise, was given to the Arya road trip, still.....I do think, bookwise, Arya's impact and meaning on Sandor and his story gets lost in the shuffle of the fandom.Â  I suspect that both show and book, Sandor will be doing Gravedigging duty, and Arya, in both mediums, has almost as much chance of drawing Sandor off the Quiet Isle as Sansa does.Â  Or, should I say.....concern for or about Arya could draw Sandor out as much as the same for Sansa.Â  I suspect, if we stick to the books even somewhat for their parting, we may get some of the important dialogue about Sansa from him to Arya.Â

Their relationship will culminate this season I guess but even if Sandor survives their lives will develop in a different direction, they are not meant to be buddies forever, their connection will always be somewhat extreme.
 And if or how the show will return to Sansa with Sandor's dying or not-dying scene we can simply wait out since we will soon know. But I still think that Sansa had a far greater importance for Sandor than he had for her (apart from the fact that he may die saving her, this is a kind of impact), not repeating my own posts here since this is an Arya-Sandor Thread.

2656	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-19	What PilusmagnusÂ wrote under the spoiler tag.
Â 

	Spoiler  Having a soft spot for Ygrittes's killer (doesn't want to know which brother shot the arrow) will add drama to their relationship. The audience will probably know who shot Ygritte but Jon won't and it will be someone he is close too making it more dramatic. Also,Â Jon making him steward will anger some of his brothers, not because he is a whore like Satin butÂ because he is just a boy with hardly any experience or time with the NW as opposed to Bowen and his cronies.
Â 
Â 
They clearly are portraying Jon and the boy (what is his name?) toÂ have a soft spot and admiration for each other.Â We mightÂ get a "my father died too..." wisdom/comfort chat from Jon?

I don't think Not!Satin will get killed. Jon will make him his steward and that will cause some NW brothers to be upset because he's picking a kid who just joined them.

Well, Ygritte ought to die in Jon's arms, so I don't they'll have someone else die in his arms as well.
If that kid lives, maybe ends up being one of the guys who stabs him? The kid is not going to like Jon's plan to let the wildlings through.

MeÂ too. 
Â 
Jon being protective of Satin (not liking the gazes the Kings men give him) is so endearing andÂ not judging a person on theirÂ past (whore tolerant) really adds to his character. It really is a beautiful bond.
Â 
HBO denies us our favourite whore but adds in Olyvar.

I totally think this will happen. I don't believe for a moment Ygritte will be dying when Jon finds her like in the book.
I was so looking forward to seeing Jon gazing at Satin too, LOL. I fully expected him to be cut, though a small part of me was thinking they'd throw him in just to up the attractiveness quota of the Night's Watch.
2671	Alayne Stone	2014-05-19	SATIN. I had half a dozen quips lined up about wool vs. linen and the relative evilness of Joffery vs. Robin.  How mortifying to realize that it wasn't a typo. The internet has ruined me.

Ohh man, I hadn't thought about Dareon in a while! I truly hope they include him into the show.. Even if this Olly fella doesn't fill the 'Dareon' role.. Â I would still love to see all that go down on screen.Â

Leathers MUST be in the show. He's the 'lead by example' wildling. He shows that wildlings DO have a place in TNW....
And yes, someone has to be there who understands the old tongue and can communicate with Wun WunÂ
2679	protar	2014-05-20	From the recent Bryan Cogman interview, we know that originally Olly would just be in that one episode at the village but they realised it would have been a bit of a plot hole to have him vanish so they seeded him into the Wall scenes. So he wasn't originally intended to take Satin's role but I expect he'll end up in that role even if D+D didn't specifically plan it. Personally I'd prefer if D+D never made any invented characters again but there you have it.
2680	DaveyJoe	2014-05-20	Whatever, I'm just pissed that Locke isn't taking that role.
2681	boojam	2014-05-20	Do you remember that kid that join the night's watch after the wildling raid his village? Don't do you think that they're putting him very close to Jon? I mean, he would not be there if there's was not a strong reason. His role could have been shorter, but they're keeping him. Has anybody else noticed this?Was he there last episode?I don't remember seeing him.
2682	Chebyshov	2014-05-20	Was he there last episode?
I don't remember seeing him.

Jon puts a hand on his shoulder in the courtyard, I think.

Dareon was in season one. No good reason they can't bring him back, though maybe a different actor. I'm not sure why they'd cast an actor as Dareon at all if they weren't going to later use the character, though.Â
2684	RoamingRonin	2014-05-20	I'm in the minority that hopes Olyvar (Littlefingers boy whore) becomes the new Satin. I like the archer kid but I hope we get a gay recruit so we get the Satin scenes from the book in some capacity. Jon's protection of Satin won't be the same if he's just looking out for some kid. The whole boy whore stigma that Satin carries doesn't work with the kid.Â
2685	snowy	2014-05-21	I thought Satin was the individual asking Gilly questions when Sam took her and Little Sam to the brothel. No?

The thing is I'm not sure they have the time to concentrate on that sort of issue anyway. The time is limited, and Jon's adwd arc is going to be condensed into one season. The Wall is going to be crowded with characters in season 5, and there are lots of interactions happening. Jon trying to integrate the wildlings and telling Stannis and everyone that the NW doesn't take part while taking part all the same, is probably a lot of conflict for the show. I love Satin in the books, but it's the sort of storyline that could be easily left out.

Â 
I can understand how Olyvar could be a sub for Satin, especially since he already exists, but so far Olyvar seems to lack Satin's sweetness.Â  That's my main concern with switching out Satin for Olyvar.Â  I don't trust Olyvar, I don't like him......he seems shifty to me.Â  What was interesting about Satin is that he was born into the brothel, born pretty, and who knows not only what his sexual preference might really be but what his life would have been if he'd been born anywhere other than in an Oldtown brothel.Â  I think Oldtown figures into Satin's character as much as the brothel does.Â  Satin just seems like a nice guy.....whereas with Olyvar, I don't get that feeling at all.Â  I think the turn down Olyvar tried to do with Oberyn was more about power, not sex.Â  Granted, they could play up that Olyvar, too, was somehow born into the brothel without much choice, but it'd take some character development that I highly suspect D&D don't have the time or patience to do.Â

Well, they've been reducing the number of characters elsewhere. I suspect that Daeron's role in Sam's trip will be taken over by Pip. He used to be a singer, he's a friend of Sam, Jon probably trusts him more than a random Brother. 
	Spoiler And it would make for more of an emotional impact when he deserts and Arya kills him.

2694	Petyr Patter	2014-05-21	Satin is a pretty easy character to cut.Â  He is another one of Jon's brothers, who is far more often described by his former profession or his looks than his personality.Â  And I'm not talking about the books, I'm talking about fans talking about the books.Â  Ser Pounce is a far more important addition than Satin.

2699	Fevre River Warrior	2014-05-27	I don't think Sam will be going to Oldtown in the HBO series and I don't think there will be a trip to Braavos en route. Not enough time to fit everything in. I think Sam will learn what he needs to learn from the library at Castle Black. I am still not sure where GRRM is going with that arc in the book - although it appears to end with dragons. I don't think HBO will go there.
Â 
I think the village boy will end up being Jon's steward, and he will do what others have said. He saw Ygritte kill his parents - the camera showed that clearly. He knows who she is.
Â 
I don't think they will waste time on Satin, although I like him in the books.

2703	ovis alba	2014-05-19	Loved the scene. But my favorite part of it was Tyrions sigh of relieve with tears in the eyes.
With Jaime and Bronn both "letting him down" after he somewhats still counted on them in some way, he still played it very cool, like he doesn't bother much still pretending to joke around, but the moment when you finally see his relief that Oberyn will fight for him, you realise also how scared he actually is, because he fully loses the whole sarcasm and gallows humor mascarade for a moment there. Gave me a little bit shivers.

Oberyn / Tyrion scene blew me away... I cried like a baby.

The look of hope in Tyrion's eyes at that moment when Oberyn said he would be his champion. I cried for that lost hope.

Â 
If they would find any way for it to work, I'd be glad to keep Oberyn, but I can't see how they can then keep the rest of the story. Tyrion has to run away, Cersei has to get rid of every person that would stand up to her crap (which includes Tywin but also Oberyn) to mess up things as much as she does, Dorne has to suffer Oberyn dying to really get things roling again.
Unless they wanna give a Lady with a heart of stone a new husband, I can't think of any way, it would make sense, as much as I hate to admit it.

Â 
For me, it's far worse than the Red Wedding. Worse than Eddard, too. Oberyn is on of my top-3 characters, and in a series with so many great ones -- that's saying something. I wanted his revenge for him, for Doran, for Dorne. Oberyn is unlike any other character -- not only in his swagger, sexiness and all-around persona -- but he truly does have RIGHT on his side. Elia and her children being killed cannot be compared to RW deaths (where one can make the argument that Robb knowingly put himself/his men/Cat in that situation).
Â 
Elia and her children were truly innocents.Â 
Â 
It's killing me that Pascal will be gone soon -- he's nailed Oberyn from the 1st scene imo.Â

2725	Greywolf2375	2014-05-19	He's pretty much nailed every scene he has been in...and it's going to be even more painful than reading it (as long as they do it right) when he goes all righteous vengeance and gets his head squeezed like a pimple.
2726	OnlyOne	2014-05-19	Who cares? He'll lose anyway.Â 
Â 
Tyrion will never be the same again.Â 
Tyrion is evolving all the time. And technically, the Red Viper doesn't entirely lose and I cannot wait to see the Sand Snakes:-)
Â 
I hate how things change...
2727	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-19	How damn lucky are we that they got this guy as Oberyn. He has been pretty much pitch perfect with what they've given him so far...if the fight is even 50% as good as it is in the books...can you imagine how he's going to knock it out of the damn park? He's been really subdued so far...I can't wait to see his blood up shouting taunts at the Mountain.
2728	Arrowtic	2014-05-19	Whenever I think about the moment when he dies in that cruel way , I get immediately sadÂ  Â . Just imagine his destroyed face (
If I recall correctly , it was also said by one of the staff that one of this season's deaths is going to be super cruel , so much that HBO actually didn't let all of it be included in its episode(that would be Oberyn imo) .
Just one thing : Do you think that they'll change The Mountain's death manner ? Is it possible for him to die on the battlefield right after killing Oberyn ? because otherwise they'll either have to inform us of his death in the same episode(which is unlikely coz I think episode 8 will end with the duel) or make him die in episode 9(which is also unlikely because of all the stuff that are going to happen in that episode)
I JUST HOPE THAT THE MOUNTAIN DIES THERE SO EVERYONE SEES HIS DEATH AT THE HANDS OF PRINCE OBERYNÂ
2729	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-19	Â 
^This. So much this. Perfectly said what I was thinking.
Â 
Â 
Â 
For me, it's far worse than the Red Wedding. Worse than Eddard, too. Oberyn is on of my top-3 characters, and in a series with so many great ones -- that's saying something. I wanted his revenge for him, for Doran, for Dorne. Oberyn is unlike any other character -- not only in his swagger, sexiness and all-around persona -- but he truly does have RIGHT on his side. Elia and her children being killed cannot be compared to RW deaths (where one can make the argument that Robb knowingly put himself/his men/Cat in that situation).
Â 
Elia and her children were truly innocents.Â 
Â It's killing me that Pascal will be gone soon -- he's nailed Oberyn from the 1st scene imo.Â 

God I hope we get a good Dorne cast to follow this up. Arianne and Doran's revenge talk in AFFC is one of my favourite scenes
2730	Ingelheim	2014-05-19	Pedro Pascal has been brilliant since episode 4x01, but his scene yesterday...was just another level
2731	AZAXD	2014-05-19	Just AWESOME. All the Casterly Rock talk was so great to hear. Tyrion's expressions were perfect. Most emotionally impact full scene for me this season since his speech last week! I like how Jamie and Bronn visited earlier too, my Unsullied dad (as I'm sure most would've) thought either one of those would fight for him so it was clever to tie up those loose ends and I liked those scenes too.
2732	ipsuel	2014-05-19	God I hope we get a good Dorne cast to follow this up. Arianne and Doran's revenge talk in AFFC is one of my favourite scenes


You and me, both! I really love the Dorne stuff, most especially Doran. I love how different Doran is from Oberyn, in mannerism and in method.Â
2733	ipsuel	2014-05-19	Pedro Pascal has been brilliant since episode 4x01, but his scene yesterday...was just another level


The tears in his eyes were just... well, the whole scene he was just perfect.
2734	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-19	On the interactions from this season, I'm am buying the Oberyn poisoned Tywin story
2735	Rhaquentis	2014-05-19	Such an amazing and powerful scene! Well done to both actors, Tyrion has had the greatest scenes this season, as expected.
2736	ipsuel	2014-05-19	On the interactions from this season, I'm am buying the Oberyn poisoned Tywin story


I've always wanted this to be true. It's one of my fave theories although I'm not quite sure I'm on board -- but I love the thought of it!
2737	Bear Island	2014-05-19	Oh, man. That scene was amazing. The hardness in Tyrion's eyes as Oberyn tells the story, the veiled anger and misgiving when he's called a freak... then his expression when Oberyn says that he was just a baby. That was a beautiful piece of work and both actors were just perfect.
I am going to cry like a baby when Oberyn dies. He's always been in my top 5 list of favourite book characters but he's probably my favourite show character. He is such a fun character, but also so utterly tragic.
2738	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-05-19	I have a distinct feeling that we wont see Oberyn having his skull crushed in. I predict Clegane slicing him in half or decapitating him will be what we get. However, I feel that Oberyn is such an amazing character (especially brought to life on the screen by Pascal) that it would be an ultimate disservice if we did. Oberyn is badass.. He deserves to die in the most badass way ever!
2739	Carl Rhaego	2014-05-19	The actor is perfect, he nails the attitude and has so much charisma. With all the changes, I wouldn't mind if they kept him alive. His character was killed off way too soon without realising his potential when boring characters like Samwell and Brienne, who are well past their expiration date, are still alive in the books.
2740	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-19	I have a distinct feeling that we wont see Oberyn having his skull crushed in. I predict Clegane slicing him in half or decapitating him will be what we get.

I'm pretty certain it will be just like the books. They've teased it in a photoshoot with Pedro and Lena, and foreshadowed it during the tavern brawl in Two Swords.
2741	igrewupinKL	2014-05-19	Best part of the episode. So much emotion, so captivating. excellent.
2742	lostinasia	2014-05-19	For me, it's far worse than the Red Wedding.Â 


Me too. I was looking forward to seeing how they'd do the Red Wedding, and when watching "Rains of Castermere" I was somewhat surprised to feel a pit developing in my stomach at around the 40 minute mark of that episode - "Oh weird," I thought, "I guess I'm kind of nervous about seeing this."
Â 
But Oberyn? That pit has been in my stomach for a week or so already. In the jail scene with Tyrion, part of me was wishing Oberyn wouldn't volunteer. (And when you think about it, what would YOU find more fun to read? A bunch more chapters with Oberyn in them, or the post-Storm of Swords Tyrion chapters that we've got?)

Photoshoot, I don't know, Tavern brawl: Sandor wrestles with the guy on the ground, clenches his hand around the face, and stabs him a few times in the face. Or something like that. I don't recall clearly. Not too far off how Oberyn dies in the books.
2745	sati	2014-05-19	My favorite scene of the season. They were both amazing but Pedro is seriously MVP this season.

It was a great scene. It makes his coming death more significant and adds to Tyrion's madness.
2750	Ferrum Aeternum	2014-05-19	And to think his casting announcement was met with such outrage.


Â 
Yeah, this is proof that Nina Gold & co. get it right far more often than not.Â 
Â 
It was a powerful scene that couldÂ have been played a number of ways.Â  Pascal got it just exactly right.

Â 
Â 
I think Oberyn dies differently in the show. Remember in the books Ser Gregor smashes his head in like a sledge hammer to a melon. Â But Oberyn mentioned that Ser Gregor used his sword to cut his sister in half. I think that is how he finishes Oberyn on the show.
Â 
I like this Mountain more than the NBA looking guy from Season 2. Â Even though this guy is over a foot shorter than the book Ser Gregor he's just as fierce, still he Â 7'1" guy from season one would have been picture perfect.
Â 
I think Camera angles are going to play a big role in this scene.Â
2752	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-19	Nah, he won't cut Oberyn in half, would changes the dynamics of the duel. And be less of a hope-crusher. Oberyn coming so close to victory is what makes his death so crushing
2753	libertine	2014-05-19	That scene was just awesome. Pascal just nails every scene he is in. I will be truly sad when he dies next episode.
2754	Jasta11	2014-05-19	Honestly, Pascal is such an amazing Oberyn that I wouldn't complain one bit if they had him survive the duel. Hell, I always thought it was the one time where Martin killing a character was a mistake anyway. The Red Viper had too much potential, both in show and books, to be killed off like that.
Â 
Alas, there's no way for Tyrion's story to make any sense if he wins his trial. Unless they make up that Oberyn using poison disqualifies him or something, but that would be way too anticlimatic.

That would be too easy. A sword? No, the death is horrific and distinctive, changing that would be a mistake
2756	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-19	Getting cut in half is pretty horrific and distinctive I'd say, lol, but no I don't think it'll be changed.
Â 
Plus, there's this: http://img3.hungertv...opy-518x470.jpg
2757	Chebyshov	2014-05-19	That would be too easy. A sword? No, the death is horrific and distinctive, changing that would be a mistake


Â 
Agreed. Even though getting cut in half would be gross, nothing compares to how it's going to actually play out.
Â 
I think they had Oberyn say what they did about Elia being cut in half by his sword to remind us of who The Mountain was. This is their 3rd actor for him, so some clarity would help. In S1 we saw him cut his horse's head off in one blow, which was discussed as distinctive later (when Ned was sitting the IT hearing about the horrors in the Riverlands). It's just another way to remind everyone that we've heard of this guy before.
Â 
The Lena and Pedro pic proves he's going to be dying in a way that is likely quite similar to the books.
2758	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-19	I don't get why people keep saying that he gets cut in half because that's what he did to Elia...is he going to rape him first also like he did to Elia?
Â 
Just seems silly that people keep using this as a basis to justify it.
Â 
I'm sure its some type of head smash, eye gouge deal...the whole point is Oberyn getting to close thinking he's won. GRRM robs of of Oberyns win at the last second...they're not going to alter that beyond recognition.
2759	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-19	It's not far fetched. In the books Gregor's line is: "And then I smashed her fucking head in, LIKE THIS!" And then does the same to Oberyn.
Â 
Their deaths mirror one and other's, so if Ellia was cut in half...

					
					
							Edited by Blood Loss, 19 May 2014 - 09:16 AM.
2760	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-19	Far more likely they cut the line than let Gregor get into a position to cut Oberyn in two. He should have a fucking spear right through him!
2761	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-19	Yeah, because they never omit lines from the books...
2762	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-19	His death is going to hit me hard, you guys. Pedro has been absolutely fantastic.
Â 
That said, I want Gregor to smash his fucking head in (if he leaves him unrecognizable maybe Varys can switch him with some drunk and send him to Essos)
2763	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-19	Great idea for a thread. Â I NEVER thought anything or anyone could make me love Oberyn more, but Pedro Pascal has done it. Â Seven Save Us All, I am going to miss that man.
Â 
The Red Viper...Elia's champion, Tyrion's champion, and mine. Â I don't think the character would regret the outcome (well, once ALL of Gregor is finally dead and buried, LOL) but DAMN, don't do it!!!!!!!!!!! Â Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Â 
Okay, had to get that frustration out, I will miss him terribly. Â It may be a good thing it's a two week wait for the next epi. Â

My heart stopped, I think, reading Oberyn's death and seeing and feeling the crushing of that beautiful face. Â The teeth being smashed by the mailed fist really got me. Â Too many root canals on my part, I think. Â Plus, I loved the hell out of Oberyn and didn't think we'd lose such a great character we had just met soooooooooooooooooo fast. Â What an idiot I can be, huh??
Â 
I do recall how it seemed the tavern brawl had The Hound first trying to smash that guy's face with his hand, but he couldn't quite do it or quite get the right grip going, and he settled for the face to the blade, over and over. Â That did immediately make me think of The Mountain. Â I think I stubbornly refused to finish the scene in my head, though. Â
2770	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-19	I always wonder why they change tiny things like this.

I gotta admit, I do wonder on that. Â First, we lose a ruling woman, and a Princess of Dorne. Â But, I suspect, that while such things make me stop and wonder about why they take another strong woman from us.........I think it might mean we may never hear about the marriage scheme between the mothers. Â That would be crazy, come to think of it. Â The equation needs Cersei's bitterness about not getting Rhaegar and Oberyn's feelings on how that directly related to Elia's death. Â I could be wrong....I hope I'm wrong, hell......they gave Bronn to Lollys, LOL, maybe we will hear the Westerosi version of A Midsummer Night's Dream?? Â

It's just a bizarre change to make.Â 
I mean, at some point it means the writer was adapting the scene and he read "our mother took us to Casterly Rock" and he thought "hmmm no, should be their father" and then went through the effort of changing one word in a rather throwaway-ish line because he didn't like that a woman was ruling?Â 
It's such an insidious way to work your agenda into your script.
Â
2775	ebevan91	2014-05-19	Will be next week. Will hate to see Oberyn go and Ellaria become irregular.


Â 
I'm actually quite interested in where Ellaria will go from there. I don't quite remember what happened in the books. Did she stay in King's Landing or head back to Dorne?

Â 
Dorne. She made that speech about "when does it end" to Arianne, Doran, and the elder Sand Snakes.
2777	The_Lone_Direwolf	2014-05-19	Horrible thought but does anyone else think Oberyn's delivery in telling how Elia died hinted at a slight double meaning with the line about cutting Elia in half with his 'great sword'? Maybe hinting at the horror of the damage he caused by raping her?
He talked fondly about what a great mother she was and how much she loved children so maybe this is part of the rage behind the rape part of the famous'you raped her, you murdered her. You killed her children!' line.
Not a pleasant thought but one that would fuel such a rage.
2778	aFeastForDragons	2014-05-19	Best scene they've ever done in the show. Incerdible acting, great dialogue and it was the perfect length.

Tyrion crying and then Oberyn crying was just magnificent.

Hats off to these two actors. If only the rest of the show was as good.Â
2779	Har!!!	2014-05-19	On the interactions from this season, I'm am buying the Oberyn poisoned Tywin story


Â 
Agreed. The whole, "everyone I want to get revenge on (paraphrased)" line kind of clinches that theory for me.
2780	Envie	2014-05-19	Me too. I was looking forward to seeing how they'd do the Red Wedding, and when watching "Rains of Castermere" I was somewhat surprised to feel a pit developing in my stomach at around the 40 minute mark of that episode - "Oh weird," I thought, "I guess I'm kind of nervous about seeing this."

Â 
I definitely have this pit in my stomach phenomena building too. I watched the shocking Red Wedding scene without too much flinching other than the un-written addition of them stabbing "Talisa" in her stomach - that was just shock value gruesome ... but I honestly don't know if I'm going to be able to keep from turning away if they do in fact keep this scene true to the books and have Clegane crush his head.

Â 
Â 
Remember- in the books - this is a man who physically assaults some of the women he was with, then takes their children away from them. Â What a guy! Â He kills who he wants to, fucks who he wants to, mouths off to who he wants to, and lives- by-in-large- without any consequences whatsoever - because he's a "Prince of Dorne" and you can do that... and ... readers LOVE him for that. Â 
Â 
I know people love Obreyn and try to give him that nice "consolation prize" at the end (*sniffle*... *sniffle* ... "But... he ... the... the Mountain eventually dies at the end ...." *sniffle*,... *sniffle*) but at the end of the day, the plan was never to end that fight with a giant fist in your teeth and a hole where your brain used to be.

No need to be so snide to those of us who appreciate the character they've portrayed in the show. I honestly don't remember Oberyn being all that terrible in the books either based on the comments you made I believe I will have to go back and re-read some of the chapters with him in them.
Â 
But still - even if he was as 'terrible' a user / abuser as you put it (I tend to think you're exaggerating a tad) - the appreciation thread was for the powerful acting between the two in that scene. It was very moving and tragic because neither of them ultimately gets what they had hoped for - far from it.
2783	NightStark	2014-05-19	I can't wait for Â that big bag of wind gets his face plowed in. Â 
Â 
I know everyone loves the arrogant, loud mouth who is "doing this for his sister" (but, pray tell, what was all the other poisonings for?) and the actor on the show is doing a very good job ... playing an arrogant, hedonist who id seeking revenge for his sister,,, and its about as interesting for me as watching paint dry, Â The guy has had 15 years to get his vengeance... apparently he was waiting for juuuuuussst the right time. Â 
Â 
Remember- in the books - this is a man who physically assaults some of the women he was with, then takes their children away from them. Â What a guy! Â He kills who he wants to, fucks who he wants to, mouths off to who he wants to, and lives- by-in-large- without any consequences whatsoever - because he's a "Prince of Dorne" and you can do that... and ... readers LOVE him for that. Â 
Â 
I know people love Obreyn and try to give him that nice "consolation prize" at the end (*sniffle*... *sniffle* ... "But... he ... the... the Mountain eventually dies at the end ...." *sniffle*,... *sniffle*) but at the end of the day, the plan was never to end that fight with a giant fist in your teeth and a hole where your brain used to be.
Â 
Then again, it was an improvement ,....Â 


Â 
Wow.

Â 
Hmmmmmmmm, I've already done many rereads, and I think I'll just wait and see if this loooooooooooooong list of Oberyn's victims show up. Â  
Â 
The acting was beyond terrific, both of them. Â Personally, whether either version of Oberyn poisoned Tywin or not, I do think he'd call it quite worthwhile to go if he could take The Mountain with him. Â Why else do the fight> Â He knew he was risking his life and compared to all those he wanted vengeance against, The Red Viper is a damn saint. Â
2785	Labirints	2014-05-19	Loved that scene.Â
2786	ipsuel	2014-05-19	Me too. I was looking forward to seeing how they'd do the Red Wedding, and when watching "Rains of Castermere" I was somewhat surprised to feel a pit developing in my stomach at around the 40 minute mark of that episode - "Oh weird," I thought, "I guess I'm kind of nervous about seeing this."
Â 
But Oberyn? That pit has been in my stomach for a week or so already. In the jail scene with Tyrion, part of me was wishing Oberyn wouldn't volunteer. (And when you think about it, what would YOU find more fun to read? A bunch more chapters with Oberyn in them, or the post-Storm of Swords Tyrion chapters that we've got?)


I agree with you... he's one of the best characters GRRM created imo -- and he would've been great for several books to come! If only Jaime could've broken Tyrion out a little sooner Â 
I get why GRRM killed him, but I really think he missed the boat on this one particular death. He's so unique that no one (except maybe the Sand Snakes) can pick up where he left off. (Like Rob did for Eddard, Roose for Tywin, etc...).
2787	ipsuel	2014-05-19	Honestly, Pascal is such an amazing Oberyn that I wouldn't complain one bit if they had him survive the duel. Hell, I always thought it was the one time where Martin killing a character was a mistake anyway. The Red Viper had too much potential, both in show and books, to be killed off like that.
Â 
Alas, there's no way for Tyrion's story to make any sense if he wins his trial. Unless they make up that Oberyn using poison disqualifies him or something, but that would be way too anticlimatic.


Me, too - that's one change I would rally for :-).Â Day dreaming, but if Jaime/Varys got him before the duel -- Oberyn could live! 
*ugh*
2788	King Tyrion I	2014-05-19	What an amazing scene with two great actors!
Â 
Oberyn and Tyrion nail it. Every bit of it.
2789	MarieAntoinette	2014-05-19	Oberyn's actor is awesome and perfect for this role. I'll be sad after he is gone. He was one of the highlights of this season.
2790	ipsuel	2014-05-19	I really hope Pedro Pascal gets the credit he deserves for this episode/show... (as well as NCW and Jerome Flynn).
Â 
Everyone makes so much of Peter Dinklage (who was great, also) that some other great actors/performances seem to get lost amongst PD's praises. I love Dinklage but I don't think he's any better as an actor than the other guys who made the cell scenes so amazing.
2791	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-19	I agree with you... he's one of the best characters GRRM created imo -- and he would've been great for several books to come! If only Jaime could've broken Tyrion out a little sooner 
I get why GRRM killed him, but I really think he missed the boat on this one particular death. He's so unique that no one (except maybe the Sand Snakes) can pick up where he left off. (Like Rob did for Eddard, Roose for Tywin, etc...).


Â 
Agreed. I think Martin sacrificed a great character for shock value.Â 
Â 
Maybe he thought the rest of the Martells would make up for the loss, but not for me. The Sand Snakes, in particular, are so annoying and so far from Oberyn no matter how many times people say they're "Oberyn with teats"
2792	Clariana	2014-05-19	On the interactions from this season, I'm am buying the Oberyn poisoned Tywin story


Â 
Well I personally love that theory but unfortunately I haven't seen a hint of it... But, who knows?
2793	ipsuel	2014-05-19	Â 
Agreed. I think Martin sacrificed a great character for shock value.Â 
Â 
Maybe he thought the rest of the Martells would make up for the loss, but not for me. The Sand Snakes, in particular, are so annoying and so far from Oberyn no matter how many times people say they're "Oberyn with teats"


Absolutely for shock value. I don't mind main character deaths (Eddard, Robb, Catelyn)... I see the reason for them, pushing the story along, creating conflict, etc. But for Oberyn, there really is none of that.Â 
Â 
And I kinda feel that way too about the SS. But I'm forcing myself to give 'em a chance cuz I love the Dorne-storylines. I just hope the SS don't turn out cartoonish or typical. So far, it's not looking good -- but I'm going to reserve judgement til we the next book.Â
2794	zytz	2014-05-19	Â 
Agreed. I think Martin sacrificed a great character for shock value.Â 
Â 
Maybe he thought the rest of the Martells would make up for the loss, but not for me. The Sand Snakes, in particular, are so annoying and so far from Oberyn no matter how many times people say they're "Oberyn with teats"


Â 
Have to disagree - the fact that Oberyn is such a BAMF and favorite character of many is what makes the death such a tragedy. Â It keeps in line with some of the main things that I think set ASOIAF apart from other tales. Â The good guys don't always win... even the good guys that aren't good in the traditional sense. Â The most vicious and ruthless survive. Â It forces you to start looking for hope in characters that are flawed.
2795	I'm_Tim	2014-05-19	I think the show will fix Martin's mistake and make the Sand Snakes bad asses. 
At some point, the audience needs some redemption for all the good guys that die. Us book readers have stuck with it to see how it plays out despite the books growing worse and worse. The TV viewing audience is far more fical.
2796	GeorgeIAF	2014-05-19	One of the best scenes in the show ... shivers down my spine, i don't know how i will react when he will scream about Elia ...Â
2797	Raksha 2014	2014-05-19	Oh, man. That scene was amazing. The hardness in Tyrion's eyes as Oberyn tells the story, the veiled anger and misgiving when he's called a freak... then his expression when Oberyn says that he was just a baby. That was a beautiful piece of work and both actors were just perfect.
I am going to cry like a baby when Oberyn dies. He's always been in my top 5 list of favourite book characters but he's probably my favourite show character. He is such a fun character, but also so utterly tragic.


Â 
Â 
The dialogue, the understated interplay between Pascal and Dinklage, just wonderful. Â I think the only other time we've seen tears in his eyes was when he awoke after the Blackwater to find himself scarred and reduced to meager lodgings and Pycelle's scorn at his no longer being Hand, the tears coming when Shae comforts him and swears her love or whatever (and in that moment, TV-Shae did seem to love Tyrion). Â But this episode brought Tyrion to his lowest point, with both Jaime and Bronn refusing to champion him, and then Oberyn telling this story of how poor baby Tyrion was reviled as a freakish monster all over Westeros as well as by his sister, apparently. Â You get the sense that Tyrion is thinking even more deeply that he was damned and doomed from birth. Â And then Oberyn comes out with the incredible line "just a baby" - and Tyrion knows that this man saw him, and still does see him, as a human, not an Imp, not a "freak". Â 
Â 
And Pascal sells it soooo well, because Oberyn is not sentimental when it comes to Lannisters; and is a sophisticated man of the world, not a particularly innocent soul. Â But he was seeing Tyrion as a man, and Tyrion so needed to have just one of his "judges" do that; and that person willingly offer to champion him, lifted Tyrion out of his despair. Â It was a great scene.
Â 
I would have liked the bit from the book, Oberyn's mentioning how Elia responded to baby Tyrion (wanting to hold and cuddle him, feeling the same way about him that girls sometimes do for babies and puppies and kittens). Â It was not crucial to the ongoing narrative of ASoIaF, but it would have added some character to the young, nearly forgotten Elia, showing that she was a person capable of tenderness and kindness, not just Oberyn's beloved, horribly murdered sister. (and they could have spared 60 seconds for that and cut out Hot Pie's presentation of more wolf pastry) Â But the Oberyn/Tyrion scene was brilliant.
Â 
I am dreading the last few moments of the Oberyn/Mountain fight.
2798	Rockroi	2014-05-19	No need to be so snide to those of us who appreciate the character they've portrayed in the show.
Â 

Â 
Consider it a freebie.Â 
Â 
No, no, I know.Â  I was projecting a bit.Â  I will say that I actually like the actor playing Oberyn; I just never warmed to the character/
Â 
Â 
I honestly don't remember Oberyn being all that terrible in the books either based on the comments you made I believe I will have to go back and re-read some of the chapters with him in them.
Â 

Â 
Noâ<U+0080>¦ I actually remember reading and rereading the books; I have read them many, many times.Â  And I always just roll my eyes when I get to his chapters, until I remember that they end in a satisfying mannerâ<U+0080>¦ well, for me anyway.Â 
Â 
But still - even if he was as 'terrible' a user / abuser as you put it (I tend to think you're exaggerating a tad) - the appreciation thread was for the powerful acting between the two in that scene. It was very moving and tragic because neither of them ultimately gets what they had hoped for - far from it.
Â 

Â 
Now that I agree, but I thought it was touched up a bit much.Â  I think Tyrion is in a very vulnerable position and that showed; and I think the Viper is using the opportunity for his own ends.Â  However, I thought Tyrion crying t the story of Cersei pinching his cock was a bit much (it felt forced to me; like we all had to see evcery single torture Tyrion has ever been under, even ones that he was too young to remember- but now is crying over so we all know that he was â<U+0080><U+009C>impactedâ<U+0080><U+009D> by it).
Â 
As far as Oberyn being an â<U+0080><U+009C>abuserâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+0093> in the books its very clear:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>The day my father came to claim me, my mother did not wish for me to go. â<U+0080>She is a girl,â<U+0080><U+0099> she said, â<U+0080>and I do not think that she is yours. I had a thousand other men.â<U+0080><U+0099> He tossed his spear at my feet and gave my mother the back of his hand across the face, so she began to weep. â<U+0080>Girl or boy, we fight our battles,â<U+0080><U+0099> he said, â<U+0080>but the gods let us choose our weapons.â<U+0080><U+0099> He pointed to the spear, then to my motherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s tears, and I picked up the spear. â<U+0080>I told you she was mine,â<U+0080><U+0099> my father said, and took me. My mother drank herself to death within the year. They say that she was weeping as she died.â<U+0080><U+009D>

Â 
So, we have physical abuse, mental cruelty and then taking a daughter from her mother.Â  Classy!Â  When Robert did that to Cersei people said he was a monster.Â  Butâ<U+0080>¦ when somebody we LIKE does it â<U+0080>¦ that changes, miright?
Â 
Look, my issues with Oberyn are just that- mine.Â  Everyone else loves him and praises him. Â That's fine; people are entitled to their opinions. Â Here is all I see: an entitled bully who talks a big game, who hits women, who wants what he wants and never pays the consequencesâ<U+0080>¦.
Â 
Â 
â<U+0080>¦ until that one time. Â
2799	Milcov	2014-05-19	His list of known poisoning victims extends to Ormond Yronwood (correct Yronwood?). Nobles take their bastards all the time as well, and he hit one woman to prove a point. Obviously it's not acceptable but considering that on the whole Oberyn is very good with his treatment of his daughters, Ellaria, and his extended family (Arianne thinks very highly of him) he clearly isn't some horrendous drunk who beats all the women and children he can get his hands on. I'd actually say that as far as how men treat women in asoiaf Oberyn ranks pretty highly.
2800	OnlyOne	2014-05-19	The actor is perfect, he nails the attitude and has so much charisma. With all the changes, I wouldn't mind if they kept him alive. His character was killed off way too soon without realising his potential when boring characters like Samwell and Brienne, who are well past their expiration date, are still alive in the books.

I agree but his death will put other pieces into play.

Â 
As far as Oberyn being an abuser  in the books its very clear:
Â 
The day my father came to claim me, my mother did not wish for me to go. She is a girl, she said, and I do not think that she is yours. I had a thousand other men. He tossed his spear at my feet and gave my mother the back of his hand across the face, so she began to weep. Girl or boy, we fight our battles, he said, but the gods let us choose our weapons. He pointed to the spear, then to my mothers tears, and I picked up the spear. I told you she was mine, my father said, and took me. My mother drank herself to death within the year.

Â 
 until that one time. Â  

Well, if my loved one said that to me, I'd probably back hand them too. And his Sand Snakes love him. Sorry, I don't see him as a bully. A bit arrogant? Yes.
2802	The Monkey	2014-05-19	Yeah, seeing him go in the next episode will be gut-wrenching, maybe even more so than the RW.
2803	Ankou	2014-05-19	"She unveiled the freak... Your head was a bit large, your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw... No red eye, no tail between your legs... Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment, "that's not a monster, we told Cersei. That's just a baby."
Â 
Oh man, the feels...Â  


I thought Oberyn and his crew meant they were size queens.
2804	aramea	2014-05-19	I looked over several threads, but I could not find anyone discussing this possibility. Â I wonder if it is possible for the show writers to combine Oberyn and Quentyn, given the propensity to combine characters. Â I can't see a downside and I can't offhand think of any reason that Oberyn HAS to die. Â Quentyn dies anyway, so may as well keep a well loved character around. Â That and I do wish to see more Oberyn. Â I like show version much better than book version and I think an encounter with Danaerys would be interesting.
2805	Moseh Khayim	2014-05-19	No chance. Oberyn dies.Â
2806	Rockroi	2014-05-19	Well, if my loved one said that to me, I'd probably back hand them too. And his Sand Snakes love him. Sorry, I don't see him as a bully. A bit arrogant? Yes.Â 
Â 

Â 
Right - you find this behavior acceptable in a character you like while you find it unacceptable in a character you dislike. Â That's what I have been saying all along; that people LOVE Oberyn and just turn a blind eye or justify this behavior and stare all googly-eyed at how heroic and dashing he and his brains splattered all over the tourney arenaÂ  is. Â You just ignore/pseudo-justify the fact that he got angry at the mother of one of his children who had the AUDACITY to want to keep her own child! Â So he hit her in the face so hard she cried and then threw a spear down at the child (I am sure there were no issues with that) and demanded that the CHILD choose! Â Wow. Â Father. Of. The. Year. Â 
Â 
And the Sand Snakes love him? Â Yeah... that's the problem. Â This guy engages in behavior that should have got him killed ages ago; he poisoned people, he cripples others and tourneys (then claims "Twasn't me- the horse got ansy"), and then loudly insults the Lannisters etc etc etc and people ... love him... So much that they are following his example which has paid off in almost getting Maercella killed and almost plunged the realm back into war. Â Great life-lessons there. Â 
Â 
I understand that readers love him and that people in the book "love" him (meh ...) but I find him to be a bully who has never had to live with the consequences of his actions; a walking advertisement for regal privilege. Â And he wanted a fight with the Mountain, until the fight ... got him...
Â 
I never warmed to Oberyn because he acts the way a man would act if he never had to worry about the consequences of his actions; something ASoIaF has beaten into our heads is false- from Robb to Robert to Ned to Theon to Jaime to Jon Snow to Dany to Tywin to Lyanna Stark etc etc etc - you have to live with the consequences of your actions. Â Not this guy. Â Meanwhile he brags about what a complete asshole he is! Â Does anyone call him on it? Â No. Â And why? Because- as Varys said in the prior episode - he's a Prince. Â 
Â 
To me, that's a bit arrogant and gives him the license he needs to be the bully. Â Right up until he meets a bigger one. Â
2807	aramea	2014-05-19	No chance. Oberyn dies.Â 


Sure, this is the obvious one. Â I expect it and won't be crying in my beer or anything. Â I didn't really think much of Oberyn in the books because he was around for such a short time. Â It seems logical to just have him set off for Essos as a stand in for Quentyn, another Martell flash in the pan (though I liked him in the books and rooted for him hooking up with Dany).
2808	Blazfemur	2014-05-19	Sure, this is the obvious one. Â I expect it and won't be crying in my beer or anything.

Â 
Changes from the books and the shows i'd accept:
Â 
Oberyn poisons the mountain, kingsguard/guards take him away per tywins orders anyway. Oberyn is imprisoned while the mountain's normal storyline takes place.
Â 
Varys releases Oberyn, and Tyrion, together they escape on separate ships, tyrion goes to illyrio, and oberyn back home.
Â 
Oberyn's storyline continues as his character plays the part of Quentyn's character... Oberyn sticks around as Oberyn until he's roasted in the pyramid like quentyn was.
2809	Darryk	2014-05-19	Was powerful stuff. Got to admit, I was choking up.
Â 
I was looking forward to the Red Wedding reactions but I'm actually dreading the reaction to Oberyn's fate. Out of all the deaths in the books, that's the one that felt the most like GRRM was actually trolling us.
2810	Blazfemur	2014-05-19	Was powerful stuff. Got to admit, I was choking up.

Â 
a lot, a LOT, of pressure on the roles they cast for Dorne, to follow up an act like Pedro set. He set a new standard, for how Dorne should be and act, and i hope GoT cast good actors to follow him.
2811	Volverin	2014-05-19	Oberyn being Quentyn? I would never want that to happen. Oberyn is way too badass to pull a stupid stunt like Quentyn. I prefer him to die fighting.

Â 
oh no me as well. It's an excellent ending for an amazing character.
Â 
I'm saying the only way to pull off Oberyn living beyond the trial. I'd accept that scenario, if it meant getting more of Pedro's antics onscreen haha
2813	ipsuel	2014-05-19	Just re-watched the Oberyn/Tyrion scene and I think I love this part the most:Â 
Â 
"That's not a monster," I told Cersei. "That's just a baby."
Â 
I feel like it's the first time TvTyrion hears someone (aside from Jaime) calling him the exact opposite of a freak/monster... Oberyn's saying, "You're as normal as the rest of us, with a slightly larger head and shorter arms/legs." I think it's quite profound, actually.
Â 
(It's slightly different in the books but the effect is the same).
2814	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-05-19	Some of my thoughts:
Pedro Pascal is fucking amazing. Peter Dinklage is fucking amazing. That scene is fucking amazing.
That is all.

I'd love Oberyn to live (my answer would be to have Jaime/Varys break Tyrion out early, meaning Oberyn never fights Gregor)...Â But as much as I'd love him to stick around, there's no way in hell I'd want him as Quentyn. Ugh... gawd that would never work. Quentyn is so... weak. On so many levels.

Me, too... it was just so... significant.Â
2818	Verily No One	2014-05-19	I would like to start an appreciation thread for this appreciation thread!!  I too feel like Oberyn's death is Much worse for me emotionally, than the RW. I have never felt much for Robb because of his incompetence and disregard for his father's principles. 
Oberyn was such a brilliant and passionate man who got so caught up in his love for his sister and her children that he tried to unnecessarily elicit a confession from a monster when he could have easily ended it. Besides Cat, he is the only character to date whom I truly feel sad for every time I replay his demise in my mind.

Why did you just post my post from hours ago?
It's literally cut and pasted, with no notes, quotes or any additions from you?Â 
Â 
Were you trying to quote me?Â
2820	Gannicus	2014-05-19	Pedro Pascal is Oberyn Martell.
Â 
"That's just a baby." Brilliant
2821	Envie	2014-05-19	Â 
Changes from the books and the shows i'd accept:
Â 
Oberyn poisons the mountain, kingsguard/guards take him away per tywins orders anyway. Oberyn is imprisoned while the mountain's normal storyline takes place.
Â 
Varys releases Oberyn, and Tyrion, together they escape on separate ships, tyrion goes to illyrio, and oberyn back home.
Â 
Oberyn's storyline continues as his character plays the part of Quentyn's character... Oberyn sticks around as Oberyn until he's roasted in the pyramid like quentyn was.


Â 
While I understand your 'changes' would have essentially the same outcome in the end - in that Tyrion still runs away to Pentos and Quentyn (aka Oberyn) still goes seeking Daenarys and then meets his end w/ dragon BBQ - I just don't think it's a change that would serve any purpose other than giving Pedro Pascal more screen time (not a bad thing - he's awesome). And furthermore it would be re-writing a fairly significant part of the book in regards to Quentyn's story arc from the time he leaves Dorne with his companions and their travel to Essos - searching for a ship to take them and all the trials and hassle they go through. Unless they intend to cut that entire portion of the book - and that's entirely possible - I don't really see Oberyn filling the same role that Quentyn did - very different characters. Also - it's not really Oberyn's plot to want to go and marry the Targaryen dragon queen - he's the guy with the huge vengeance against the Lannisters plot - which ends where it ends for him, unfortunately. Â 
Â 
I too would like to see Pedro stick around - he's amazing - but his story ends. We have to accept it as we've accepted all the beautiful deaths in Game of Thrones.

2826	Er Rn	2014-05-19	One of the best scenes of the series, for sure.
Loved book Oberyn. Love Pedro as Oberyn. I'm dreading next week way more than I ever did the RW.
2827	Bear Island	2014-05-19	Â 
Right - you find this behavior acceptable in a character you like while you find it unacceptable in a character you dislike. Â That's what I have been saying all along; that people LOVE Oberyn and just turn a blind eye or justify this behavior and stare all googly-eyed at how heroic and dashing he and his brains splattered all over the tourney arenaÂ  is. Â You just ignore/pseudo-justify the fact that he got angry at the mother of one of his children who had the AUDACITY to want to keep her own child! Â So he hit her in the face so hard she cried and then threw a spear down at the child (I am sure there were no issues with that) and demanded that the CHILD choose! Â Wow. Â Father. Of. The. Year. Â 
Â 
And the Sand Snakes love him? Â Yeah... that's the problem. Â This guy engages in behavior that should have got him killed ages ago; he poisoned people, he cripples others and tourneys (then claims "Twasn't me- the horse got ansy"), and then loudly insults the Lannisters etc etc etc and people ... love him... So much that they are following his example which has paid off in almost getting Maercella killed and almost plunged the realm back into war. Â Great life-lessons there. Â 
Â 
I understand that readers love him and that people in the book "love" him (meh ...) but I find him to be a bully who has never had to live with the consequences of his actions; a walking advertisement for regal privilege. Â And he wanted a fight with the Mountain, until the fight ... got him...
Â 
I never warmed to Oberyn because he acts the way a man would act if he never had to worry about the consequences of his actions; something ASoIaF has beaten into our heads is false- from Robb to Robert to Ned to Theon to Jaime to Jon Snow to Dany to Tywin to Lyanna Stark etc etc etc - you have to live with the consequences of your actions. Â Not this guy. Â Meanwhile he brags about what a complete asshole he is! Â Does anyone call him on it? Â No. Â And why? Because- as Varys said in the prior episode - he's a Prince. Â 
Â 
To me, that's a bit arrogant and gives him the license he needs to be the bully. Â Right up until he meets a bigger one. Â 


Â 
That's a bit condescending. People can see the flaws in characters they like and accept they exist.
Personally, I don't find Oberyn to be nearly as bad as most men in Westeros. He didn't steal the girls, he let the girls choose whether they wanted to live with him or their mothers. The mothers were often in pretty bad positions in life and by sending their girls off to be raised by Oberyn they're giving them a future that includes and education and opportunity. If I had to choose a father in Westeros, it would be Oberyn. He gives his girls freedom, raises them to be as liberated as a woman can possibly be in that society. He teaches them to fight so they can defend themselves. That is one of his most attractive qualities as a character to me.
Is he a murderer? Yes.
Is he arrogant? Yes.
Does he fuck around constantly? Of course.
Is he impulsive with an explosive temper? Absolutely.
He has flaws, just like every other human being ever has.
2828	Mad Monkey	2014-05-19	Well, technically Oberyn wasn't convicted of any murders so I don't think it's fair to call him a murderer...
2829	Bear Island	2014-05-19	I should have said killer, that's what I actually meant.
He killed the Mountain, but that was completely legal. He would have killed a bunch of people as a sellsword, but that's presumably not something one can be prosecuted for. I don't believe in the Tywin poisoning theory, and I can't remember if there were any stories about him poisoning people (aside from the Mountain) that were true.

Â 
wait, what the troll??
Â 
Oberyn's awesome. When he dies it'll be a sad day in two weeks. Book watchers will hurt more than Show watchers, since he's had very limited screen time (though in the time he has had, he's made a HUGE impact).
Â 
I wanna see some Oberyn dying hate threads here as a proper memorial. He deserves it, both BOOK Oberyn, and mahfuggin Pedro for properly portraying the role perfectly.
2831	Raksha 2014	2014-05-19	Loved Oberyn in the book and the TV series. Â I don't think I'll be able to watch the moment of his death, it's too horrible. Â
2832	Addam Marbro	2014-05-19	Yeah, Oberyn's definitely one of the more upstanding characters in the series. Anyone who says otherwise is just jealous of him. Some people never get over high school.
Â 
to the guy who called Oberyn out (who I assume is hella jealous of a fictional character for some reason):
Â 
- You implied Oberyn just goes around killing and poisoning whoever he feels like. This is false. He killed one person (Lord Yronwood), and it's only a RUMOR that it was poison that did the trick. Dude may have just gotten unlucky, and his wounds festered.
Â 
- Yronwood was acting like a grade-A jackass starting the duel in the first place. A paramour is free to sleep with whoever she wants, the dude should've just let it go. Oberyn was defending her freedom.
Â 
- You also claim he beats his partners. Again, a lie. (Seriously, brah, what's with the generalizations?) He hit one person, who was trying to stop him from raising his own daughter. All he did was give Obara a choice, something her mother was trying to prevent.
Â 
- He gives his daughters complete freedom.
Â 
- He is beloved by his entire country.
Â 
- He loved his sister.
Â 
- He sees past the lies of Cersei and Tywin, and recognizes innocence when he sees it.
Â 
- You claim he lives with no consequences. He sabotaged his sister's earlier betrothals, which led to her marrying Rhaegar, which led to her and her childrens' deaths. Something Oberyn had to live with. Not to mention, he is killed by the Mountain. How is that not a consequence?

2833	LionsAndTitsAndWineOhMy	2014-05-19	The Red Viper deserves much love for his brand of awesomeness, both in the books and the show.
Â 
While I definitely will mourn his death as much as anybody, I don't see his death as ONLY shock value. Â I think his death and the hole it left in Dorne was a great intro Doran Martell in the books, artistically juxtaposing how unlike his brother he is - and how they actually complimented each other. Â I'm hoping for as big a payoff with Doran in the following seasons of the show.

Â 
Oberyn's awesome. He alongside Ned Stark preside over the Westeros cool dad's club. He's an very complex and interesting character. Well traveled, can speak in different languages and has demonstrated curiosity and a thirst for knowledge that is shown in him earning maester's links. And there's his notorious love life and numerous offspring, but interestingly enough, half of his daughters were conceived by the same woman. That fact alone is fascinating and speaks not only of him but of Ellaria and the bond they've created. It may be an unconventional relationship even for today but one as a reader gets the impression that they love and respect each other.
2835	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-19	Me, too - that's one change I would rally for :-).Â Day dreaming, but if Jaime/Varys got him before the duel -- Oberyn could live! *ugh*

Oberyn would still want to fight the mountain though

And a perfect demonstration of two things:
A) how people can, essentially depending on the impression the character has made on them through whatever their personal biases are, interpret identical information in completely opposite ways, a fascinating phenomenon which basically sabotages the concept of flawless logic in one fell swoop (I'm not saying you aren't  entitled to your opinion. Just interesting how different 2 opinions with exactly the same draw info can be) 
2) how carried away people can get disliking fictional characters
2837	lostinwesteros	2014-05-19	One of the best scenes of the series, for sure.

Â 
But not the other way around, eh? Â ITs not how people can get carried away with ... .liking a fictional character. Â Me thinks you doth protest too much. Â 
Â 
I disliked him, so I have personal biases, but people who love him do so because they are smart and interesting and open-minded and have the light of a thousand suns and the smiles of 4000 angels and give their mommies cookies on Mother's Day. Â Got it, Â 
Â 
You know I gave actual, book evidence of him slapping a woman in the face, then taking her daughter away from her ... and people were like "Oh, yeah, but he had a reason." Â Good to know I'm the one with personal biases. Â 
Â 
And thank you for telling me I'm entitled to my opinion while you say how its filled with personal biases and immune to "flawless logic." Â 
Â 
Regardless, I gave several exampls of him being a terrible and they were ignored (or worse- justified), and that was because people like Oberyn so they ignore the bad stuff. Â How is that my own biases? Â
2839	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-19	Well, Oberyn did raise three potentially dangerous killing machines who are hellbent on wiping an entire family line from the face of the planet, including innocent children
Â 
Just saying...
2840	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-19	Whenever I think about the moment when he dies in that cruel way , I get immediately sadÂ  Â . Just imagine his destroyed face (
If I recall correctly , it was also said by one of the staff that one of this season's deaths is going to be super cruel , so much that HBO actually didn't let all of it be included in its episode(that would be Oberyn imo) .
Just one thing : Do you think that they'll change The Mountain's death manner ? Is it possible for him to die on the battlefield right after killing Oberyn ? because otherwise they'll either have to inform us of his death in the same episode(which is unlikely coz I think episode 8 will end with the duel) or make him die in episode 9(which is also unlikely because of all the stuff that are going to happen in that episode)
I JUST HOPE THAT THE MOUNTAIN DIES THERE SO EVERYONE SEES HIS DEATH AT THE HANDS OF PRINCE OBERYNÂ  


I get what you're saying, but I actually think the way he dies in the book is more satisfying. He is in incredible agony up until he dies because Oberyn purposely thickened the poison to make him die more slowly IIRC. I think we are going to get a shot of him squirming in episode 10 and the reveal of what Oberyn did to his spear.Â

Regardless, I gave several exampls of him being a terrible and they were ignored (or worse- justified), and that was because people like Oberyn so they ignore the bad stuff. Â How is that my own biases? Â 

You have missed the point, all of our opinions will be altered by bias, and the point was that you logically put forward fair arguments for why Oberyn is a bad man due to logically consistent interpretation and inference from the text. Others came to the opposite conclusion using the same examples and equally valid logical conclusions. The fact that I agree with them not you is neither here nor there. The interesting thing is that both arguments are fair and logical and based on identical sources but opposite. Now because this is fiction and subjective, neither is "right" objectively but the same applies to many arguments about real issues. It just fits in with my personal theory that logic is merely a flawed tool, the best we have but flawed, and that just because something logically makes sense with no visible holes, it doesn't mean it is definitely right. 
It wasn't meant to offend you, it just happened that your point was the one of the opposite view that highlighted the argument I was trying to make.
As for the second point, certainly, though I find Oberyn an interesting and flawed character with a goal I can sympathise with, I certainly don't love him (just Pedro's acting). I'd also argue it's healthier to focus on the positives in fictional situations and characters but that's just me and may be patronising. Certainly I used to actually hate Egwene from teh Wheel of Time until I realised there was no point in doing so
2842	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-19	Well, Oberyn did raise three potentially dangerous killing machines who are hellbent on wiping an entire family line from the face of the planet, including innocent children
Â 
Just saying...

And there's the theory he started the Brave Companions, hardly brownie points for that. He is not a nice man, certainly. But there are so few of those left in ASOIAF
2843	Mad Monkey	2014-05-19	Oberyn didn't endorse the killing of children. At least in the show, he has a fairly good idea of who deserves to be punished -- Lord Tywin, Gregor Clegane, Amory Lorch, Robert Baratheon... (Was there anyone else?) I don't remember him going after Joffrey, Myrcella, or Tommen.Yeah, his kids are a little screwed up but sometimes kids end this way. Arya has a hit list so long that I can't remember it but that doesn't make Ned a bad father or a bad person.
2844	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-19	Â 
I'm pretty certain it will be just like the books. They've teased it in a photoshoot with Pedro and Lena, and foreshadowed it during the tavern brawl in Two Swords.


Yea plus it would be pretty difficult for him to slice someone in half or decapitate them when he is pinned to the ground by a spear.
2845	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-19	Great idea for a thread. Â I NEVER thought anything or anyone could make me love Oberyn more, but Pedro Pascal has done it. Â Seven Save Us All, I am going to miss that man.
Â 
The Red Viper...Elia's champion, Tyrion's champion, and mine. Â I don't think the character would regret the outcome (well, once ALL of Gregor is finally dead and buried, LOL) but DAMN, don't do it!!!!!!!!!!! Â Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Â 
Okay, had to get that frustration out, I will miss him terribly. Â It may be a good thing it's a two week wait for the next epi. Â  


Good point, in Oberyn's mind he still succeeded in getting revenge on Gregor (and possibly Twyin if you believe the poison theory) so I don't believe he would regret it either. Afterall he had the poisoned spear tip as a backup plan all along. Â
2846	Dragonstar	2014-05-19	This one scene made me fall in love with the show again... the acting was just staggering...Â  the genuine look of hurt and sadness on both actors. In the book and in the show, Oberyn is just so incredibly magnetic.

Â 
This is a thread in the TV forums for fans to appreciate Oberyn's characterization in the show and Pedro Pascal's performance. Â I don't think this dialogue about the book character belongs here.
2848	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-20	#StopTheViolence.
Â 
Oberyn is a man of westeros, with all the flaws involved, but even so, he does better than the rest of other men in Westeros. He does treat his daughters with equal opportunities. Not many men would. If my daughter was being kept by a man with no good prospects, and I can bring her a better life, I would try to take her with me, and I'd punch him on the face to take her.
2849	Jerol	2014-05-20	I know how this will play out but damn, I'd pay extra for my HBO subscription to have a show of just Oberyn whoring and killing across Westeros.Â
2850	sepia_majesty	2014-05-20	I'm so glad you made this thread.Â  My love for Oberyn's character has grown immensely due to the actor's portrayal, which is probably a first for the show.Â  I will be sad to see him go so soon.Â  He's amazing and the scene was phenomenal.Â  I'm glad it resonated with everyone as much as it did for me.
2851	TheOthersCome	2014-05-20	Maybe they'll change the outcome of the trial and Oberyn decides to stand just a little bit away from Gregor when he's broken on the floor. There's a change I'd fully support.

Sadly they could never change the outcome, Oberyn's plan (considering he defeated the mountain) was to take Tyrion to Dorne and potentially crown Mycella.
2852	Red Raven	2014-05-20	This one scene made me fall in love with the show again... the acting was just staggering...Â  the genuine look of hurt and sadness on both actors. In the book and in the show, Oberyn is just so incredibly magnetic.


Â 
Peter and Pedro are just fantastic together. Â I'd watch an entire season of just the two of them talking to each other. Â 
Â 
I liked Pedro immediately when he was cast and that scene drove home just how completely perfect he is for the role. Â It breaks my heart knowing Oberyn isn't going to live much longer. Â I and a fellow bookwalker friend had a conversation today trying to come up with various scenarios (some quite outlandish) the show could do to divert from the books to keep Oberyn alive, knowing full well D&D won't do it. Â Sigh. Â Â
2853	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-20	Loved the scene. But my favorite part of it was Tyrions sigh of relieve with tears in the eyes.
With Jaime and Bronn both "letting him down" after he somewhats still counted on them in some way, he still played it very cool, like he doesn't bother much still pretending to joke around, but the moment when you finally see his relief that Oberyn will fight for him, you realise also how scared he actually is, because he fully loses the whole sarcasm and gallows humor mascarade for a moment there. Gave me a little bit shivers.


Same here. I *loved* that bit!!
Â 
Â 


"She unveiled the freak... Your head was a bit large, your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw... No red eye, no tail between your legs... Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment, "that's not a monster, we told Cersei. That's just a baby."
Â 
Oh man, the feels...Â  


Tyrion's reactions throughout make the moment that much more poignant too.
Â 
The two actors play off each other so fantastically in this scene.
2854	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-20	It's scenes like this that really do make me take a step back and appreciate all that is good with this show. Fantastic acting, brilliant score, great dialogue and lighting. Wonderful.Â
2855	Roose Seal	2014-05-20	It's scenes like this that really do make me take a step back and appreciate all that is good with this show. Fantastic acting, brilliant score, great dialogue and lighting. Wonderful.Â 


Scenes like this brought back what has been missing to the show for a long time: emotion.Â 
The last time a scene gave me the shivers like this one was Arya asking Thoros if he could bring back a headless man and saying goodbye to Gendry and before that it was Theon burning Robb's letter all the way back in s2.Â 
Even the RW, while shocking, was completely devoid of emotion for me.Â 
I feel like s1 had a lot more deep emotional moments and that's what made me like the show - it managed to balance emotion and shock and violence very well. In s2-3 it seemed at times like they dropped the emotional component altogether in favor of cheap shock.Â 
Here's hoping they make the Lady Stoneheart reveal into the sad scene it's supposed to be and don't treat it as a shocking OH MY GOD SHE'S STILL ALIVE twist....Â
2856	Barbossa	2014-05-20	Â 
Peter and Pedro are just fantastic together. Â I'd watch an entire season of just the two of them talking to each other. Â 
Â 
I liked Pedro immediately when he was cast and that scene drove home just how completely perfect he is for the role. Â It breaks my heart knowing Oberyn isn't going to live much longer. Â I and a fellow bookwalker friend had a conversation today trying to come up with various scenarios (some quite outlandish) the show could do to divert from the books to keep Oberyn alive, knowing full well D&D won't do it. Â Sigh. Â Â 


Â 
Â 
Did that as well with some friends of mine, we all knew from the books how awesome of a character Oberyn is..but the way Pedro portrays him it makes you like him even more. He is literally the ideal hero, someone who everybody can sympathise with.
2857	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-20	Scenes like this brought back what has been missing to the show for a long time: emotion.Â 
The last time a scene gave me the shivers like this one was Arya asking Thoros if he could bring back a headless man and saying goodbye to Gendry and before that it was Theon burning Robb's letter all the way back in s2.Â

Yeah, there are a few scenes that really jump out at me too. Robb's executing Karstark is another one for me, it was a very powerful scene.Â 
Â 
When the score is used perfectly alongside great acting, and a good scene it makes for perfect television.Â
2858	Sand11751	2014-05-20	I def didn't agree with the casting, "Pedro who? Who TF is that?" but the portrayal certainly grew on me. Can't wait to see how the fight with Gregor plays out. Couldn't have been any better in the book than if just the villain died or Oberyn had said: "Hello! My name is Oberyn Martell! You killed my sister. Prepare to die!"

Yep and they're both stones...
2861	Mordos_Kull	2014-05-20	People suggesting The Mountain will cut Oberyn in half need to consider the set up of the combat. Oberyn dies in close quarter combat. He said himself, big swords are not effective in close quarter combat. The way D+D could really add a twist is if the Mountain pulls out a dagger, proving he's not as stupid as everyone thinks (but i doubt he would, plus it would clearly be seen on him)
Â 
Oberyn's downfall is his own confidence in his victory, hence why he gets close and personal before he attempts to finish off the Mountain, because he wants to hear the Mountain admit his crime.
Â 
They need to have all that, otherwise the combat will be over in 2 minutes.
2862	The Killer Snark	2014-05-20	What actually occurs in ASoS affected me as badly as the Red Wedding, so I'll make the most of things for the next few episodes. That scene between Oberyn and Tyrion so far has been the most stirring and poignant moment in the whole series. I was really, really hoping they wouldn't bungle either the casting or direction they took with Oberyn, but they've done a perfect job in both areas, concerning one of my top 5 favourite characters in the books.
2863	Pigeon Pie	2014-05-20	Yes, I agree. I LOVED Oberyn. It's amazing how quickly he descended from new character to one of my absolute favorites. And the scene was epic. Oberyn's talk of baby Tyrion, and PD's genius acting... people kept talking about Only Cat and how it would be the absolute highlight of the season, but I loved this one a lot more- it got me to almost cry for Tyrion and then it got me grinning like an idiot. Oberyn's such a great character. Shame he'll die soon.Â

Â 
I purposely did not re-watch the scene from my initial impression when it aired - but HBO has been posting the best clips from the episodes and so again I watched and again it brought me to tears - the play of emotions between Oberyn and Tyrion are done so superbly by Pedro and Peter - it's hard not to feel that emotion and swell of hope Tyrion feels at the end even knowing the outcome.Â

Watched it again during the replay oft he episode last night. Hard not to "fuck yeah" when he says he will be Tyrion's champion.
2866	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-20	Maybe they'll change the outcome of the trial and Oberyn decides to stand just a little bit away from Gregor when he's broken on the floor. There's a change I'd fully support.There's no way they'll change that. It's the catalyst for major changes to the status quo and it's critical to Tyrion's story arc.

2868	Shebara	2014-05-20	Oberyn has been painted too much a sex addict so far by the show, they did not show enough of the vengeful experienced dangerous warrior, the Red Viper, they did not show his wits, his humour, his empathy....but this scene made up for all of it!
I already been close to tears after the duell when reading the books, but now I been already close to tears after that scene, it was heartbreaking!
First he gave Tyrion the last blow, making him feel with his story that absolutely noone ever wanted him to survive and live, really no hope left....and then the wonder: I will be your Champion!!!

Â 
It may sound strange but I think the fact the show didn't really establish Oberyn as such a great warrior - I think only Cersei mentioned that in their scene in previous ep - will make the shock bigger for non book readers. They probably think 'oh well he is definitely gonna win and that;s gonna be a surprise since they showed Mountain as unbeatable". And then BAM.

My unsullied friend also thinks Oberyn is going to win. He even sees Gregor as some random fighter that is going to be killed like Dario killed Meereen's champion, although perhaps in a slower way. If something, then they failed to reintroduce the Mountain as the real killer he is, because Oberyn is perfect.

i agree, this scene totally made up for all that was lacking in the Only Cat scene....i cant rmr too well, but that story about Tyrion/Cesei/Oberyn when they were kids, in the books wasnt that when Oberyn first met Tyrion? I felt it was so i was kinda bummed they cut it out...but Oberyn's delivery and Tyrions reaction were just epic...Peter D. is reallllllly gunning for that award this seasonÂ

People seriously love Oberyn.

Â 
definitely, he's the fastest growing favorite character after Tyrion in S1 from what i've seen with my unsullied friends...
Â 
my unsullied brother guessed almost right away after the first or second ep that Oberyn would die...his comment was "man im really starting to like this guy...guess he's gona die next"...and he knows Tyrion makes it to book 5....so now i keep filling his head with all the possibilities of Tyrion/Oberyn teaming up

Â 
Come on, if you've learned anything from watching the show (or any adaptation from book to screen) you'll know that *anything* can be changed. Besides, whatever this duel's importance to the overall story is can be accomplished by other means. This is a fantasy world we're talking about with a huge cast of characters and plenty of wiggle room; If the writers think there's a better way they have lots to work with.
Â 
Having said that, I do agree that the duel will probably go down mostly like in the books. Sadly, because of the peculiar fascination and devotion to this scene, no matter how it goes down I'm sure plenty of readers will feel unfulfilled or outright disappointed (e.g. the choreography of the fight, if Gregor is too ... robotic, if Oberyn's sword skills are lacking, etc. etc.).Â 
Â 
One thing I am pretty sure of is, they will alter the ending to the fight. That would be very hard to film in a way that exhibits the pure brutality yet realistic. CGI can only do so much Â .. and yet another reason for readers to complain.

And Rory (Sandor) was talking about a truly graphic and long fight. Everyone assumed they were talking about a fight he does, but because he's already wounded (and therefore doesn't have to fight anyone), he's likely talking about viper v mountain.

I think the eyes thing is in, they didn't shy away from that in the inn fight so why do so now? Which leads me to believe that the fist thing is in too, since they need to make it the most brutal death this season.

Actually, here's the article with Rory's quote: http://insidetv.ew.c...-fourth-season/
It's rather difficult to tell if he's talking about one of his own scenes or not, but it sounds like a good description for Oberyn and Gregor. 
Either way, this is the RW all over again. I'm going to be having a stress attack through the whole episode, lol.
2888	The Killer Snark	2014-05-20	My stomach clenched during the eyes thing. It was a sense of total impending disaster. Groan...and then the teeth! In the book form, the next Daenarys chapter faces the page showing Oberyn's death, so I had to read the first page of that before inserting my marker and putting the book down. But I had to rescan it because I hadn't been able to focus on her chapter's opening correctly because I was in shock. My mother thinks that Oberyn is defo going to win because the show hasn't done a good job of showing the fact that Gregor (a pervasive influence in the novels) is damn near inhuman. Regarding reader evil toward Unsullied, I told my mother before the RW she was really going to enjoy that episode because a lot of things happened in it to bring happiness to the good characters of the show.

2890	ServantOnIce	2014-05-20	I rooted for The Mountain the first time I read the duel. I thought Oberyn was a cocky bammer and didn't like him on the first read. Â 
Â 
The re reads have made me appreciate him but still I don't him cheating by using poison against Ser Gregor. Â  Either kill the man straight up or don't challenge him at all. Might as well tossed a vial of wild fire on him and a match . . . Â  Â  Â 
Â 
Still, I had an intense feeling when reading the duel the first time . . Â  great thing Â . . . Â I wanted Tyrion to go free, I wanted The Mountain to silence this cocky fool, I wanted the cocky fool to avenge his sister's rape and murder . . Â  great read. I will read it again!
2891	Raksha 2014	2014-05-20	I am going to try to turn away and miss the actual moment of Oberyn's death. Â Would rather not see all the blood and gore, particularly the painful and graphic death of a character I care about.
2892	Blazfemur	2014-05-20	One could argue Oberyn knew he was going to lose.. The poison was so slow acting, it couldnt have killed Gregor in the same battle it was applied. If he meant to kill gregor, hed kill gregor. The poison may have been a safe haven if he lost scenario. He wanted a long, painful death for gregor.
2893	direwoofwoof	2014-05-20	Best scene in a long time. Oberyn's compassion towards Tyrion ("you were just a baby") and Tyrion's heartbreak hearing about how Cersei really DID hate him from the very beginning ("cersei always gets what she wants"). It made me cry for Tyrion's past and Oberyn's short future.
2894	II_CHIEF	2014-05-20	He has been incredible all season and this week he went next level.
The scene in the dungeon was amazing, absolutely pouring with emotion on both sides

The poison was insurance. Oberyn expected to win and should have won, but he knew that win or lose, the Mountain would die and at least if he lost the Mountain would die in agony
2896	The Killer Snark	2014-05-21	Of course, the brutal death of the Obester did mean one thing in compensation...Gregor screaming for a fortnight through head to toe black gangrene, with visible guts rotting and even his penis decomposing, before being handed over to Qyburn to get dissected alive.
2897	Dragonglass Order	2014-05-21	Coming here to show my appreciation  Oberyn has been fantastic all season, and this week was better than ever. Â Both actors nailed every line, every facial expression. Â It stole the episode for me.

What are you on about? Oberyn could have easily won if he didn't do that whole " scream her name before you die " . He played to much with the Moutain and payed for it, if he went just Â for the kill TheÂ MountainÂ wouldn't have touched him.

2900	The Killer Snark	2014-05-21	All he literally had to do was pick up Gregor's fallen sword with his opponent impaled to the ground and bring it smashing through his vizor. He should have won. Anyway, he was fighting an eight foot tall man in almost hermetically sealed head to foot armour armed only with a spear. And he was justified in wanting Gregor to die even if he lost the fight because fairness in combat would not have come into it. Gregor raped and killed his sister among hundreds of innocent others. It was justice that he died.
Â 
In fact, he actually did win. He should have simply walked away before taunting The Mountain and forced Tywin and Cersei to admit their champion had been defeated because Gregor had been left with no possibility of survival. You could not have survived a front to back intestinal injury under medieval medical conditions. A rule of first blood should have applied there because in theory Gregor was already defeated to death. Tyrion got screwed by the fact that Oberyn was killed in retaliation by a man already in definitive defeat.

wait, what the troll??
Â 
Oberyn's awesome. When he dies it'll be a sad day in two weeks. Book watchers will hurt more than Show watchers, since he's had very limited screen time (though in the time he has had, he's made a HUGE impact).
Â 
I wanna see some Oberyn dying hate threads here as a proper memorial. He deserves it, both BOOK Oberyn, and mahfuggin Pedro for properly portraying the role perfectly.



How was anything I said trolling?
I listed qualities in Oberyn that I value and like and listed some of his flaws as I perceive them. He is a killer. He is arrogant. He does constantly fuck around. He is impulsive and he does have a hot temper. Those are all qualities that are in evidence in the text. When I say he's a killer, I'm talking about his time as a sellsword. None of that means I dislike him and I'm certainly not trolling.
2904	timstanton	2014-05-21	geez guys. when i started this thread it was simply out of appreciation for a great character (good or bad.) everyone is entitled to their own opinion and just because someone views someone as bad, while you view them as good, doesnt make them wrong. i thought we were all on the same page with this thought process Â . that being said...the reason i like oberyn is because, like so many other characters in westeros, he cant be classified as "good" or "bad." GRRM is amazing at making morally ambiguous characters. i appreciate a lot of the characters in ASOIaF, and for the record, I was a little bummed when Joffrey died on the show because Jack Gleeson was doing an amazing job.Â 
Â 
I just like seeing great characters and great acting. To me, Oberyn is both of those things, whether you like him or not!Â
2905	sam90	2014-05-21	What an amazing scene between two of the top actors on the show. It's a shame we will only get him for a few more (maybe one) episode. I am scared all my unsullied friends will be disappointed. He has become a fan favorite but it will be short lived, pity to lose such a great actor.


Â 
I totally agree. Pedro Pascal is probably the best actor along with yet again Peter Dinklage so far in this season. He just seems to enjoy himself playing this role and clearly he understood very well what the Red Viper's character is about.
Â 
But indeed I am afraid he has to depart on the next episode and while we are at it it looks like we'll loose The Hound and Rory MCann soon enough.

He'd still have a hiatus.
2908	Ankou	2014-05-21	Reading this was orgasmic. God, I hate the bastard...


I missed the part about his penis in the books.
2909	The Killer Snark	2014-05-21	He pisses pus. This means the gangrene has spread to his genitals. To count, the infection would have started first in his guts, his armpit, and his crippled hamstring, because that's the places he got speared. It's also my guess that Ungregor, via Qyburn, is also missing his tongue.

Could just mean it spread to his bladder. Also, Ungregor is missing his whole head is he not?

There is a head in sunspear which is supposedly Gregor's head. That's all
2912	Ankou	2014-05-21	I think the fact nobody's seen him without the helmet means he has no head! Dun dun duuuun!
2913	messem	2014-05-21	If he is UnGregor he would also not be able to show his face because the Lannisters said he was dead.
2914	Ankou	2014-05-21	True, but being headless is a better reveal.Â

Also fits with Bran's vision better:

Â 
Is he gross under there, like Night of the Living Dead under there, all bloody veins and PUS??? Â ROFL, not sure if I got the wording right, but that came to me just wondering.......does UnGregor have some pus to go with the darkness and thick black blood? Â

2918	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-21	Â 
Take a look at the poll:Â http://www.tv.com/sh...w-140028098961/


All my unsullied friends think he'll win as well, but the thing is so did I when I first read ASOS. Everything in the fight reaffirms that belief until out of nowhere it all goes to hell. I still remember being so thrilled for 95% of the fight, believing Tyrion would get off as I knew he would, and then everything changed and my stomach dropped. Most people are going to be shocked after the episode.
2919	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-21	I rooted for The Mountain the first time I read the duel. I thought Oberyn was a cocky bammer and didn't like him on the first read. Â 
Â 
The re reads have made me appreciate him but still I don't him cheating by using poison against Ser Gregor. Â  Either kill the man straight up or don't challenge him at all. Might as well tossed a vial of wild fire on him and a match . . . Â  Â  Â 
Â 
Still, I had an intense feeling when reading the duel the first time . . Â  great thing Â . . . Â I wanted Tyrion to go free, I wanted The Mountain to silence this cocky fool, I wanted the cocky fool to avenge his sister's rape and murder . . Â  great read. I will read it again!


  Looks like you got every one of your wishes somehow.Â
2920	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-21	The poison was insurance. Oberyn expected to win and should have won, but he knew that win or lose, the Mountain would die and at least if he lost the Mountain would die in agony


  and I believe that's why he went through such lengths to draw a confession. He knew he had him killed one way or the other, so in his mind it was worth it to try and to get the confession he desired, no matter the risk.Â 
Â 
ETA: Sorry for the triple post

2921	The Killer Snark	2014-05-22	I disbelieve that Oberyn, a man who clearly enjoyed his life and had actual affection for Tyrion, would have thrown the fight on purpose in order to die horribly, in order to make sure that Gregor died a more painful death. It would have meant sacrificing Tyrion, which Oberyn would not have done, because he'd been honourable to the Martells in making Myrcella their ward to force the point across to Tywin that he had to kill Gregor, and others, to deliver justice. Tyrion knew his father had been implicated in Elia's death, or at least suspected it, and had already sent Sunspear a missive whose repercussions meant retaliation on the Lannisters if they reneged on their deal once Tyrion was no longer King's Hand. Hence, Tyrion was known to Sunspear as an honourable man. I doubt that Oberyn would have sacrificed him to his cause if his design had been to lose the fight and thus instigate a war against the Lannisters. The poison was a payback if he lost, because he was confident he'd at least wound Gregor, nothing more. But he knew wresting a confession from him might implicate others, so he screwed up by standing too close to Gregor while he was doing so. He should have stood at a further distance, or used Gregor's sword to first lop off his hands or arms.
2922	Le Cygne	2014-05-22	Pedro Pascal was wonderful in this scene.
Â 
He uses black blood elsewhere for fatal wounds: Khal Drogo, the man Ygritte killed, UnCat, the Ironborn Theon killed. Also Drogon's wound.Â  Brienne's angst pouring out "like black blood from a wound" to the Elder Brother.Â  Black blood ain't good.
2923	BlackTalon	2014-05-24	Of course, the brutal death of the Obester did mean one thing in compensation...Gregor screaming for a fortnight through head to toe black gangrene, with visible guts rotting and even his penis decomposing, before being handed over to Qyburn to get dissected alive. 


Â 
Huh? I know that leeched dropped off him, killed by his blood but I certainly don't recall that part ...?
Â 
Â 


will they use that line? I don't think I've ever heard the targaryen words in the show


Â 
Â 


the season 1 finale was called Fire and BloodÂ 


Â 
Â 
Dany has said the words herself. IIRC it was when the fat spice king in Qarth turned her down (the one who was standing on the stairs while making her holler up at him)
2924	The Killer Snark	2014-05-24	BlackTalon - I'm making an assumption. Gregor passed pus instead of urine and by the time he was handed to Qyburn, he'd turned black from head to foot.
2925	Tyrone_Lannister	2014-05-24	I was prepared to hate everything about Oberyn Martell aka Pedro Pascal....boy was I wrong.Â  Superb....and yes, I cried too.

Â 
Nice catch. I've never noticed this.
2927	BlackTalon	2014-05-25	Yes, Pedro Pascal makes an excellent showOberyn.
Â 
I never liked book Oberyn because of his first duel. He fucked another man's wife, and even though he knew the duel would be fought only to first blood because of his youth he still poisoned his blade to kill the other, totally innocent guy who was fair enough to fight with a clean blade. A total and utter dick move in my eyes.
2928	The Killer Snark	2014-05-25	I was more troubled about the way he forced the mothers of his daughters to relinquish their parenthood so he could press them into martial training, whether anyone else wanted this or not. Thing is, Oberyn is meant to be a bit dickish: if you have a character who's ultimately heroic and has a moral compass in spite of some despicable behaviour, they are more relatably human to the averagely moral-compassed reader than someone who's completely morally white.
2929	voodooqueen126	2014-05-25	I disbelieve that Oberyn, a man who clearly enjoyed his life and had actual affection for Tyrion, would have thrown the fight on purpose in order to die horribly, in order to make sure that Gregor died a more painful death.

and more importantly, Oberyn knew that if he died fighting Gregor, he would lose the chance to kill Tywin (a far bigger fish, since Book Oberyn had a strong suspicion that Tywin ordered Elia raped and murdered as revenge for marrying Rhaegar when Cersei didn't get the chance).

Unless he already knew he had poisoned Tywin in an eventually fatal way.
2931	The Killer Snark	2014-05-26	Which I disbelieve he actually did. It wasn't really his style. I think if Tywin had been poisoned, it's more likely to have been the work of Littlefinger and Orella Tyrell.

2954	hollowcrown	2014-05-19	My friends hilarious predictions:
Â 
Â 

Anyways, this is as far as my predictions go. Now anything can happen.
Though, having Arya+Hound and Brianne+Pod arrive at the Vale at the same time would be hilarious. Or .....what if they meet halfway there, and Brianne + The Hound battle?
Yes, I can see it now:
It's episode 9. There will be a mayor chaotic "everybody dies" climax that will happen in the end of the episode

hide

I assume it will be the wildlings attack on the Wall. The 9th episode is called "The Watchers on the Wall", so that is obviously going to be the big "battle where everybody dies".
I bet like...Sam will die or something. Or maybe Ghost, or Yrgitte. Doubt Jon will die.
Janos Slynt and/or Alester will surely die, and so will Tormund (and the cannibal dude).
Hmm, yeah, I can already see it now:
Everybody is fighting at Castle Black. There is chaos, but Jon manages to lead the defense and everybody. Alester sees this, and sees Jon alone giving orders. He thinks this is his opportunity to strike him and remove this pain in his ass once and for all. He goes to stab Jon, maybe succeds, but then Ygritte/Jon/Ghost come and attack Alester and save Jon. Alester dies.
Or could be Janos slynt....or both


However, before that, Arya and the Hound walk through the Riverlands, and notice the Eyrie far in the horizon. They decide to take a break for the night.
Before going to sleep, the Hound opens up to Arya. He confesses why he kills, maybe confesses something else he's hidden or some emotions he repressed. Maybe he had some hidden emotions when he killed Mycah, like maybe fear of reprisal by Joffrey or his brother or some stuff, and tells her about it. After that, he tells her he is sorry about murdering the boy, and goes to sleep.
Then, Arya lies down, and starts mentioning the names of her list. Joffrey is gone, Cersei is still in it, etc, etc. When she comes down to the Hound's name, she stares intensively to the camera, we hear the DUN DUN DUN Inception intense scene sound effect, and she justÂ closes her eyes, falling into a deep sleep. Arya forgives the Hound for what he did, and doesn't want him dead any more.
However, when they wake up, Brianne and Pod arrive. Brianne recognizes the Hound, and Arya (or just figures out who she is). The Hound wakes up and confronts Brianne (Arya is still asleep).
Brianne demands the Hound to give Arya to her. The Hound will try to be a smartass and ask for the same reward he'd get at the Vale. Brianne, on her honor and stuff, says he ought to give her back and then face the consequences of kidnapping a poor suffering child. Brianne starts namecalling the Hound, calling him fugly and stuff (very hurtful indeed). We see the Hound distressed, he has an injury, can't fight very well, and he knows he will lose the fight (well, he can still call Brianne names and stuff before).Â 
Brianne challenges the Hound to a fight, and the two clash swords. These wake Arya up. She sees the Hound fighting with an unknown woman who has an unknown squire. She sees Brianne is winning. She yells at them, tells them to stop, or just watches helplessly as the Hound gets his ass wooped. Maybe Brianne can at some point stop, and call her name out and tell her she will take her to safety.
Oh, but Arya doesn't trust that. Everybody that "took her to safety" lied, like the Brotherhood without Banners, and the Hound after that. The Hound is the only one she can trust now, Arya yells at Brianne to stop or something.
Brianne doesn't hear her, assumes she's afraid, and keeps beating the Hound.
The Hound gasps for air, he's tired, he can't use his left arm at all because his shoulder wound rotted and festered. He's clutching, rises to his feet. Brianne is a few meters in front of him. He looks to his side, sees Arya eye to eye. Then he stumbles to attack Brianne, and Brianne puts a sword through his chest. The Hound drops to the floor and dies.
Arya is in shock and stands still (or not, whatever). Brianne comes closer to her, and tells her everything will be alright, that she will take her to her sister or to Jon or to the Vale or whatever. Arya though, believes Brianne to be a Lannister sellsword, that killed the Hound for the reward. Brianne calls Arya by name, so Arya realizes this lannister sellsword knows who she is, so she will take her back to Kings Landing.Â 
Right before Brianne grabs her, Arya slips through her fingers, and runs away into the woods...
In episode 10, we see Arya trying to survive in the woods. We see her alone, in dark places, whatever. She makes a fire and goes to sleep. She recites her list. When she arrives to the end of the list, she calls out Brianne's name, and goes to sleep.
End.
I doubt we'll see where Arya goes next. Doubt it will be the Eyrie, at least not until season 5. Maybe Dragonstone? Would be funny having Arya meeting Davos or something, and meeting Melisandre again. Dunno what else, maybe she sneaks to the Twins and plans on murdering Walter Frey in season 5, maybe she tries to go to a port to sneak to Braavos. This I dunno, but I doubt it will be shown in this season's finale.
Anyways, I'm calling this now. Too much foreshadowing in this episode, with Hot Pie, the "fork" in the road with Brianne, the Hound opening up to Arya, Arya helping him, but the Hound refusing to "heal" his wound because of his fear of fire. It's too much coincidence...something big will happen (I hope Pod survives all of this though!).
The only thing that is a big ????? is King's Landing. I have absolutely no idea what can happen there. Maybe Tyrion escapes Kings Landing and goes somewhere else, maybe everybody dies, dunno. These next few episodes will be very intriguing back at King's Landing, anything will surprise me.

The Unsullied know nothing.

Â 
No. For someone who knows the characters, it was a little on the nose how they established the Oberyn/Mountain relationship. They couldn't have made it much more obvious without showing the two on screen and explaining why one hates the other.
But it's just really difficult as a show watcher, to keep track of this kind of stuff if you don't have a visual connection. I'm not just saying this to just be nice and appease the showfans, I have the exact same problem with other complex TV shows. If I don't read a name black on white, I have difficulties remembering exactly who this is and how he stands in relation to other characters. Just the nature of the medium.Â
2964	Darryk	2014-05-19	Yeah, they've really sucked at establishing who the Mountain actually is post-season 1.


Â 
He's been mentioned time and time again this season. Oberyn's even referred to him as "Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain"
Â 
Bar having some guy show up and draw pictures for the audience, not sure what else they're supposed to do.
2965	Frequency	2014-05-19	My brothers don't think Tyrion will die, but one sees him free and the other losing and going to the Nightswatch.
Â 
No surprises with Littlefinger.
2966	Uldra I	2014-05-19	My unsullied brother picked out the LF line "Your sister." just an instant before it happened.Â  He said it exactly with the same words!Â  I was a little disappointed they didn't have him say "Only Cat." but ... oh well.
Â 
Also he and I both cracked up at the Rorge scene.Â  After Sandor gives the "gift" of mercy to the dying man, he tells Arya that's where the heart is.Â  Then Rorge appears, and Arya get him in the heart with Needle.Â  My brother said, "She learns quick!"Â just beforeÂ Sandor did.Â  Then he starts laughing and says "See, she even wipes her blade on his clothes... just like Sandor did with the dying man."
Â 
My brother is so smart he picks up on a lot of things I'd have missed as an unsullied, but I've noticed heÂ beginning to haveÂ a little trouble remembering who is who with all the new characters in the show.Â  Don't know how or if D&D could make new characters more memorable, but maybe they can figure out a way to keep it from being so confusing.Â  My brother is really quick in the mental department, so if he is having trouble, probably other people are too.

Well, they could dye the blond's actor hair so he at least has a passing resemblance to the Mountain 1.0 or the Mountain 2.0. Or they could have kept the old actor or look for a double since, after all, the Mountain hardly needs to act.

2972	RoamingRonin	2014-05-19	One Unsullied I know has been predicting Sansa's death since the first episode. He swears up and down she's going to die. He thinks Bran and Arya "Go hard" and only the young Starks are tough. 
Â 
My Unsullied coworker e asked if Sansa was going to be a hostage for Littlefinger and I told him how she basically becomes his apprentice.Â 
Â 
Odd thing: In the middle of our talk about Targs and Martells Â he asked "Lyanna. She's Jon's mother, right?" Someone spoiled that for him so I had to fill in the blanks. He didn't realize that Rhaegar is supposed to be Jon's dad and that makes Jon a Targaryen. After that he said "So the guy on the Wall (Aemon) is his relative!"Â 
Â 
He doesn't like Dany's storyline and thinks it's getting boring cause all she does is free slaves . He likes Jon and wants more action. Â

2973	gotgrrrl	2014-05-19	Husband thinks Oberyn will win against the Mountain.Â  He also predicted that the Hound will die "the same way that Drogo did" (from an infection).Â  If it looks like Oberyn, Tyrion and the Hound (his favorite characters) are all going to die, I may have a tough time getting him to watch the rest of the season.Â  It'll be hard not spoiling Tyrion's escape.Â
2974	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-19	Â He likes Jon and wants more action. Â 


Â 
Can't fault him on either account there.Â
2975	TheCaptainSargey	2014-05-20	My mother correctly guessed that LF would push Lysa.
2976	Skyforc3	2014-05-20	My friend actually didn't like how it turns out. He thought that if Jamie had been Tyrion's champion that would have been smarter as there would be no way Tywin would allow Jamie to die, no matter what Cersei did. Also he was confused by why Oberyn wanted to help Tyrion when Tywin had already promised Oberyn revenge. He predicts that the mountain would win though, but he thinks that Tyrion will die this season.

2977	Tixu Oty	2014-05-20	My unsullied brother picked out the LF line "Your sister." just an instant before it happened.Â  He said it exactly with the same words!Â  I was a little disappointed they didn't have him say "Only Cat." but ... oh well.


Â 
Wow! that's impressive! Maybe it means that the writers did a pretty good job with that line after all then?
2978	Uldra I	2014-05-20	Â 
Wow! that's impressive! Maybe it means that the writers did a pretty good job with that line after all then?


I think it does.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Still was looking forward to hearingÂ LF sayÂ "Only Cat"Â  butÂ it's not a big deal.Â
2979	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-20	A girl I know who watches the show watched with me last night and she is so on point I couldn't believe she never read the books. 
"That Stannis guy just shows up randomly in places"
"That prince is so gonna get murdered by that bodybuilder"
"He's gonna kiss Sansa."
"He's gonna push her"
"I hope he kills that irritating kid next"
"Arya is like an assassin now"
"Cersei is crazy. She's gonna fuck up big time"
"I hate the Wall. Eveyone is just a complete wanker up there. Oh they're all criminals aren't they lol"
"I hope they don't burn that scaley faced girl"
I was amazed.
2980	Gendrys Forge	2014-05-20	Well there isÂ a guy at work who normally guesses pretty close.Â  He thinks "The dornishman" is probably going to use the tactics Bronn suggested and he will win.Â  He also thinks though that Cersei will still have Tyrion executed somehow.
2981	weirwood woman	2014-05-20	great timing when Husband told Sansa to "slap him " (Sweet Robbin)and she did right on cue! Was "over the moon" that Oberon was to be Tyrions Champion. Is clearly seeing Cerseis life long nasty streak towards Tyrion and no longer sees her as desirable. Still having trouble associating the Mountain with Gregor Clegane and thus to the hound. VERY happy to see Lysa flying out the moon door.
2982	Dragon Queen	2014-05-20	My Unsullied husband hasn't been fooled for one second by Littlefinger this season. He was pumped when Littlefinger and Sansa first arrived at the Vale, because he said that Littlefinger will kill "the crazy lady cuz she's threatening Sansa."
He's happy he was proven right this episode. As soon as Lysa started holding Sansa over the edge he was asking where Littlefinger was, then was shouting at him to push her off. As soon as it happened, he said, "Sweet! Now they can handle that brat Robin!"
I think because of the shows portrayal of Littlefinger as a moustache twirling villain, D&D couldn't end the season with Littlefinger killing Lysa. It wouldn't have had a dramatic enough effect guessing by fan reaction. People are much more interested in the fate of Tyrion in my opinion.
2983	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-20	My brother just said:
Â 
"I just know Prince Oberyn is gonna die, the show keeps killing off my favorite characters. I really was hoping Joffrey would make a it." 


Â 
Â 
 Â  and LOL.Â
2984	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-20	Jon will marry Dany and then kill her to become king.Oberyn will win the duel because they spent way to much time developing his character for him to just die and they can't kill both Oberyn and Tyrion in the same episode.
Dany is boring.
Littlefinger is smart and creepy.


Â 
bwhahahahahaha, I think those were my thoughts on my first read, yeah, yeah, even after the Red Wedding.Â  Â
2985	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-20	Hubby definitely thinks that Oberyn will win and then Tyrion will go away with him and have adventures or something. I couldn't respond at all.
Â 
Hubby is so not impressed with new Daario, so much so that not 15 seconds after he left his scene and Dany was talking to Jorah, he turned to me and asked "Who is this Daario they are talking about?" My whole family is of the consensus that Daario is too soft for Dany. Not impressed.
Â 
Otherwise, they were just happy to see Lysa go out the moon door.
2986	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-20	Â 
He's been mentioned time and time again this season. Oberyn's even referred to him as "Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain"
Â 
Bar having some guy show up and draw pictures for the audience, not sure what else they're supposed to do.


Â 
Damn, I can even hear PP's Oberyn saying that now.Â  The Mountain situation has been a mess with the triple casting issue, but I think it's been perfectly clear when it comes to Prince Oberyn and his issues with the man that did the deed on his sister and her children.Â  When the characters come together for the fight, I do think many Unsullied will get it.Â  Hopefully, we do get the Tyrion and Red Viper prep scene, and that should help cement the situation for many.
Â 
Either way, I love reading about the family and friends Unsullied, it's great to read the observations of non-readers from posters who know them.Â
2987	Mel_Rose	2014-05-20	My sister loved the episode and she was very happy to see Oberyn volunteer. I asked her if she was surprised about Lysa's death, she said "kinda" because it had crossed her mind that Lysa will get pushed when LF walked up to her next to the Moon door. Actually, she said that she was more surprised by the kiss. All in all, she was very enthusiastic about the episode.
2988	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-20	The unsullied I've spoken with were all very excited when Oberyn claimed he would champion Tyrion, and were mostly split on whether or not he would live or die.Â 
Â 
That scene was very moving, Pedro Pascal absolutely killed it. Just look at his eyes when he talks about his sister and her children, so powerful. I'm glad he was cast for the role.Â
2989	A Man Is A Man	2014-05-20	Â One of my buddy's wives is really into the show, this is from one of her emails to me. Pretty humorous.
Â 
<<I know you are not a deanearys fan. But she's my favorite leader. She hasn't been tested lately, though. I wish the author was a woman so we could get more action around the female characters. She needs to do some tricky surviving.Â 
Â 
I like the fact that finally the crazy aunt got killed. I would
Like her son to go as well. Maybe his tongue gets cut off?Â 
God, she was so annoying I think the entire audience collectively felt sadistic pleasure when she got pushed into the moon gate (or whatever that hole is called).Â 
Â 
Other characters Id like to push down that hole: sersei, that annoying guy who keeps on keeping snow down up north, and the fire witch lady with perfect skin. Id start with her.... Can't stand her. She represents every single deep hatred I have of religious people, mean women, and women with perfect skin. And while she's going down, she should take her queen too and her husband. I don't like that clan at all.Â 
Â 
Also not my favorite: the gal who is a good fighter whose brother was castrated. They can all go. And the rapist guy. Maybe they should all fight the fire people and fire people should
Drown and they should all burn. Nicely tied up - decent battle scene.Â 
Â 
People id like the see more of: the stark sisters - especially united, deanerys, tyrion, the lady knight gal, snow, and the guy with the orange sun jacket... he is rich And likes sex and what not, but has one jacket? What?Â 
Â 
Another good plot line.. The sisters, the lady knight, and snow up north get together and unite the north. And tyrion survives and goes up there to rule. Tyrion and Sansa on the throne, the others in battle with the northern creatures.Â 
Â 
The sun jacket dude goes back home and aligns with deanearys. They get together (he's a bisexual isn't he? I think so is she).Â 
Â 
I can get into this. Maybe I should quit my job and write a book. >>

In case she ever does: Please let her know, that killing of every single "bad guy" and leaving only the ones you really like living in love, piece and harmony, might not actually make the most interesting story.

Â yeah, I reminded her that the show needs villains so we can root against them!


Â 
Terrific letter, though, and thanks for sharing. Â Your letter writer did hit many things right on the nose, especially some of her nitpicks. Â I mean, wow, yes, Oberyn does carry that jacket well.......but damn, they couldn't buy him some more wardrobe? Â He does look damn good in it, though. Â I think she was spot on about Mel and her perfect skin, Carice's skin is lovely. Â
2993	Ambria	2014-05-20	My mum seems to be under the impression that Cersei is the ultimate villain
Â 
When asked about the mountain scene " it was Cersei, she got together a bunch of prisoners and sent them against the mountain for fun, and to make sure he got practice before the real fight"
Â 
She also thinks that Cersei tried to poison either Tyrion or Marge, but it backfired and killed Joff instead
Â 
Amongst other things, she pretty much blames her for everything bad that happens.

3000	sj4iy	2014-05-21	I know some people who can't stand the 2-week wait that they want to look up spoilers (I told them not to). They love Oberyn (of course, who doesn't?) but most of them are concerned that Tyrion is going to die. They really liked seeing Lysa 'fly', too. That shocked a lot of them.

3002	majgat	2014-05-21	My GF is an unsullied one and after reading posts of unsullied opinions/prediction I asked about E7 Mockingbird

- she knew LF is gonna shove Lysa
- didn't know about LF/Sansa romance and was a bit shocked
- new Daario is her new crush and she approves (not like Jorah)
- she really likes Jaime now (especially with short hair)
- didn't know who "the big guy" butchering people is, so I had to explain that's it's The Mountain
- she believes Oberyn will prevail (might be because I'm finishing up DwD book and she saw Tyrion chapter), but I'm sad for her, because he's her new favourite character
- Brienne and Pod / Arya and Hound are both going for the same place
- thinks wildlings under Mance are gonna breach the Wall and go south
3003	DiegoSnow	2014-05-23	I watch the show with 3 Unsullied frieds, and they all were enthusiastic about Oberyn championing Tyrion! He's become one of their favorite characters, and they're convinced he will win... I can't wait to see their faces next episode! (Having read the books, their reactions and opinions are one of the best sides of watching the show  )Â 
Â 
About Littlefinger, they surely didn't expect the kiss, and when they noticed Lysa had witnessed it they really thought Sansa was going through the Moon Door  However, when Littlefinger "saved" her, they all saw Lysa pushed coming (and they were pretty happy about it  )
Â 
They're really excited about this last episodes, especially about the Tyrion situation... I guess they won't be disappointed

3008	RadoLukacs	2014-05-24	My friend said he has a new favorite character - Littlefinger, because he was waiting impatiently for the annoying aunt Lysa to die.  He also said Oberyn is pretty badass and expects the duel to be a tough one, but he thinks Oberyn will win. (He spoiled himself about Tyrion killing Tywin by reading a synopsis on A Feast for Crows back cover, but he doesn't know how or when, so he assumes Oberyn has to win the duel for Tyrion to be able to kill Tywin while still being in the city. He wonders where Tyrion will go now.) I am looking forward to his reactions after these three episodes so much!

3009	BuggerThemAll	2014-05-24	The hubby thought for sure that Bronn would be Tyrion's champion. He couldn't think of anyone else that would  champion Tyrion. This just proves to me how D & D fail at providing enough backstory, although they did include mention of it when Oberyn spoke with Tyrion. Have they even mentioned Oberyn's gifts with poison or why he is called the Red Vyper?

Lol, they have mentioned Oberyn's gift with poisons (Tywin's own visit, in public, to THE Brothel?~I wasn't really around for that epi, can I nitpick that now~), but haven't, iirc, alluded to his nickname of The Red Viper, which is odd......considering the title of the next episode. Â

Has they not change him from the books, everyone will remembers him but for all the wrong reasons LOL
3012	Le Cygne	2014-05-24	Daario is too soft, that's hilarious. And they also feel sorry for Daario. Poor Daario.I don't know how the show pulled this off, but they did.
3013	franko99	2014-05-24	My friend thinks this episode was predictable, (not that it nothing wrong with that, she actually liked it)
Â 
Dany sleeping with Daario was as obvious as Jon sleeping with Ygritte last season.Â 
Â 
She saw LF killing Lysa as soon as the marriage was mentioned last season, she was actually wondering why it took so long LOL
Â 
Oberyn being Tyrion's champions was pretty much spoiled by the trailers, but she love the scene anyways, but with episode 9 so close she expect something terrible happening soon.
Â 
She likes Jon a little bit more after Craster's, but still doesn't gife a f*** about the Wall

One thing is for sure, this guy is not "fire" as Barristan calls him. Though I really can't blame them for trying to change book Daario, he's just...no, no way he make it into the screen.

3014	Gheimhridh ag teacht	2014-05-24	This is going to be particularly tough, because Oberyn was always one of my favourites when reading, so I had been very excited about his casting/introduction and my unsullied partner was aware of my excitment. Â And so he greeted The Red Viper with due respect and admiration of his pure awesomeness. Â I also filled in a little bit of Oberyn's back story - travelling the Free Cities, his stint with the Second Sons, earning links on his maester's chain at the Citadel, the real story he has with the Tyrell's, Elia's death, etc. etc., so that he'd be even more aware of what an amazing adversary Oberyn would be.
Â 
So, when he stepped up to help Tyrion (my partner's favourite character), oh how my sweet summer child whooped in happiness!! Â He's convinced there's no way in hell Tyrion can die, because people would boycott the show, and so he's convinced that Oberyn will surely bust the Mountain to smithereens. Â 
Â 
*Sigh* I think what's coming might hurt even worse than the Red Wedding for him.... Â  Â
3015	Neumond	2014-05-25	"So crazy aunt is dead now? What is "sneaky guy" going to do in this mountain village?"
I really laughed so hard at this...
The interesting part: He never seemed to think that perhaps Sansa has something to do there, too.
3016	Three sisters	2014-05-25	I accidentally spoilered my unsullied sister.
Â 
I was reading the pre-published Tyrion chapter from WoW. So, when my sister asked what I was reading, I told her that. And she was: 'yes! Oberyn is gonna defeat the Mountain'.
Â 
I apologized. But in a way she does not know much. She thinks Oberyn will stay on the show for a while.

I'm guessing that they'll explain it before the fight next episode.
3018	Elba the Intoner	2014-05-25	I had to come here when I saw this thread because I want to mention something where it seems the show runners lost some of the impact surrounding how much Ptyr and Lysa did to start the war. My unsullied mom and sister liked this episode and saw the push coming, but when I asked them if they understood what Lysa did for Petyr, they weren't sure. They knew she killed for him but that's it. I had to explain about Jon Arryn and starting all the Stark Lannister hostility. I tjink the show messed up by having Lysa reveal that info a few episodes back in a whisper to Petyr that most people missed.

Â 
That reveal was always going to be problematic because it's about a character who was dead when they began the show and who has rarely been mentioned again since. Martin generally has this problem with holding off on closing off mysteries until way past the point where they matter (or the audience still cared about them).

No, it doesn't prove anything. But, the hubby knew that Jaime couldn't fight with his left hand, and Bronn would get his ass kicked by the Mountain. He couldn't think of anyone left to fight. D &D really didn't go into why Oberyn is so deadly, nor have we seen him fight at all in the show.

Â 
Did the books show Oberyn fighting before the duel? Why do we need this? It's established that he's dangerous and it's cooler that the first time we see him fight is in the duel because his fighting style is so unique from other knights in Westeros.

They mention at least 3 times how he is a great warrior, feared through all the seven kingdoms, theyÂ explicitly create a scene to mention he knows about poisons, and he tells the story of how the Mountain raped and killed Elia and her childrens every fucking time he's on screen, we actually had a lot more of Oberyn in the show than in the books.Â 
Â 
If it proves anything is that some people doesn't pay attention at all, and those people are not of D&D concern, there's a limit of how much they can dumb down the show for the very casual viewer.

Lol, okay. Enough said. I'll have to rewatch to make a note of when they mention he's a warrior.  It's just sad that they sure as fuck make it known that he's promiscuous at every opportunity available. The very casual viewer can't deny that. The rest is questionable.  I'll take another look, though.
3026	BuggerThemAll	2014-05-26	Â 
Did the books show Oberyn fighting before the duel? Why do we need this? It's established that he's dangerous and it's cooler that the first time we see him fight is in the duel because his fighting style is so unique from other knights in Westeros.

Of course it didn't.  The backstory is there, though, in detail.  In the books, we know Oberyn well. In the show,  I can understand why viewers might be confused.
3027	Inv1ctus	2014-05-26	I know many people who thought Oberyn is one of the possible champions. They really mentioned a lot how he hates the Mountain and the Lannisters. There were less people who thought that the Mountain will fight for the queen tbh. They mentioned Oberyn's knowledge of poisons, and if the scene with two Lannister soldiers didn't show that he means business and he is dangerous, I don't know what would. +They also mentioned that Dorne was the only place which stood against Targs and the dragons in the first conquest. So it was implied heavily that Dornish people are great warriors. They could use some of the scenes they've shown with Oberyn in brothel to maybe say how he was in the Second Sons or smth.
Â 
So if your husband didn't think Bronn had any chance, why would he think that Oberyn will have a chance if they explained some more how he was a great fighter? I thought it was established that Bronn is a great fighter also (and a smart fighter who doesn't give a crap about honor), it's just that he would have to face the Mountain. So not sure why some unsullied would think that Bronn doesn't have a chance but Oberyn has it?

He didn't think Oberyn had a chance because he didn't even realize that Oberyn was a fighter. If there was more backstory mentioned, like his time with The Second Sons, then maybe the hubby would have thought of him. I don't know! I was just sharing what the hubby said.
He thought that Bronn would fight for Tyrion, but would not fare well against The Mountain. Anyone else, yes, but not The Mountain.  And yes, he didn't even think of The Mountain as an option to fight for the Queen, but when it was revealed, he had no idea who would fight him.
3029	Inv1ctus	2014-05-26	But that can also be a good thing, because I imagine he enjoyed the dungeoun scene between Tyrion and Oberyn that much more, than he would've if he'd be pretty sure Oberyn was the champion beforehand.

Good point!  That scene was epic, wasn't it?
3031	Ugly Little Girl	2014-05-27	Did everyone miss Oberyn destroying the Lannisters in the brothel in his first episode??
3032	BuggerThemAll	2014-05-28	Did everyone miss Oberyn destroying the Lannisters in the brothel in his first episode??

That's what I said! He said it didn't count... for whatever reason,  haha.
3033	LordPounce	2014-05-31	One of my unsullied friend, who is a careful watcher, knew Oberyn would champion tyrion and he is obsessed with Oberyn. He thinks he will the fight and tyrion will be free. I could only look at his face and laugh  The show has portrayed very carefully that Oberyn is a warrior and is a good warrior. I think your hubby needs to rewatch the episodes to grasp Oberyn's character.
i told another friend of mine that you thought ned stark wont die but he did, you thought robb stark wont die but he did, so do you think tyrion wont die? and she was like if that little guy dies then I will stop watching the show  hahaha..i want to see her reaction when the next episode airs. It will be awesome.

Haha, that's awesome! Yeah, it will be fun.  The hubby decided to watch the entire show from season one to better grasp things that are happening. Doing so helped him understand Lysa and Petyr's role more,  plus a few other things,  like connecting the two Mormonts,  etc. So, yeah, I hope it all makes more sense to him by the time he gets to season 4 again.  He HAS predicted that both the Mountain and Oberyn die.  I don't know how. I give him a skeptical look and to not be a cheater, haha.
3035	Lord_Baelish	2014-05-31	My manager finally understands why I love Littlefinger so much after this episode. As I said to her, he killed (or had a hand in killing) two of the most horrible, unlike-able characters in the series. What's not to love?
Â 
I think she's fully converted now.
Â 
She is also convinced Oberyn will win because Tyrion "can't die".
3036	juanml82	2014-05-31	My mother thinks Tyrion will go to the Vale to rescue Sansa (because he'll find out she's there somehow) and he'll plot against his father.
Wrong on the first one, she has no idea how close she is on the second one
3037	Lady Arwen	2014-06-01	My boyfriend is convinced that Oberyn will slay Gregor and Tywin. Poor, sweet summer child.Â

Official Synopsis: Tyrion gains an unlikely ally; Daario asks Dany to allow him to do what he does best; Jon's warnings about the vulnerability of the Wall are ignored; Brienne follows a new lead.
Official Promo: https://www.youtube....h?v=ygU32GP5Jgs
Official Recap: [not yet released]

NOTES: I will update this post throughout the week as I learn new information. If something is italicized, it is merely speculation. If not, it is concrete information.
-
As far as I can tell, these characters will not appear: Davos, Theon, Yara, Bran, Ygritte
In King's Landing: Jaime berates Tyrion for his decision to call for a trial by combat. Presumably, Tyrion will try to get Bronn to champion him and fail miserably. Fortunately, Oberyn pays Tyrion a visit and offers to be his champion ("If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.") The queen chooses Gregor Clegane as the royal champion. Gregor executes some commoners on Cersei's order, probably in an attempt to frighten Oberyn and/or Tyrion (and the audience) by demonstrating the Mountain's brute strength and merciless brutality (at one point, Gregor impales a man with his greatsword and lifts him up into the air).
Jon and his group return to Castle Black from Craster's Keep. The Night's Watch prepares for the wildling assault. Jon makes suggestions, but is rebuffed by Alliser and/or Janos.
Brienne and Podrick continue their quest and pursue a new lead. I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess it has something to do with the Brotherhood Without Banners and their new leader.
Melisandre takes a bath and shares a moment with Selyse (in a ship cabin, at Braavos, or back on Dragonstone? - I can't tell from the promo). The sorceress shows the Queen her powders of manipulation and a vision in the flames.
Daario asks Dany to let him 'do what he does best.' Whatever that means. Possibly carrying out a hit on somebody? Being sent on a mission? Or something more intimate? Dany sure looks infatuated.
Â 
Arya learns the gift of mercy. Sandor learns about the bounty on his head ("Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silvers!") and removes his armor (so he could be less identifiable?). Apparently, they get into a fight with bounty hunters and the Hound suffers some wounds. I assume this is the episode where Arya and the Hound learn about Joffrey's death; with news of Sandor's bounty must come news of the recent regicide.
Â 
Sansa builds a snow castle resembling Winterfell and is threatened by a jealous aunt. Littlefinger rectifies the situation with a short, sharp shove. Unknown if Littlefinger actually kisses Sansa (Aiden Gillen stated in an interview that the Littlefinger/Alayne relationship would be less creepy, more paternal.)
-
This hour looks to set up the big events of the final three episodes of the season, while still holding a few big events of its own. I especially look forward to Tyrion, Arya and Sansa's scenes. Also interested to see how the new actor for the Mountain is.
What do you guys think? Anything to add?

3039	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-12	That about sums it up. Â I'm 50/50 on a followup Yara appearance.
Â 
Wow, this episode is a lot more packed than I thought it would be.
3040	Lord Carson	2014-05-12	Daario requesting to kill someone is more likely than sex. He says the exact words "let me do what I do best" after saying she should let him take of her enemies. It's possible, of course, that that was edited and he is asking for sex, but it seems less likely than a killing based on the preview.
3041	Ned's Sword	2014-05-12	I'm slightly shocked we're getting Lysa flying this early I genuinelly expected it to be in E10 right before the SH reveal. I wonder what will Sansa do for the remaing episodes since her ASOS arc is over. Anyways, it's good to see the snow castle come to life.
Â 
btw, I found this labeled as the recap of the episode:
Â 
Brienne follows a new lead on the road with Podrick; Tyrion finds a surprising ally; Jon's warnings about the Wall's weaknesses are ignored; Daenerys mulls giving Daario a longer leash.
Â
3042	Lord Carson	2014-05-12	Â 
btw, I found this labeled as the recap of the episode:
Â 


This is what makes me think he's requesting to kill rather than fuck.
3043	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	So we are thinking the Hound will get his wound this week? First time without armor so maybe the best time for it to happen.
Â 
Good question on that Mel and Selyse scene. I thought it was dragonstone, so when does Mel leave for the North (as I am assuming that is where Stannis is going next and not back to Dragonstone).
Â 
The new lead for Brienne I assume will take her off the path to the wall and into the riverlands (maybe its word of the hound and Arya, though I guess someone could of blabbed about Sansa's rd hair). Actually I think its definitely a Hound/Arya lead. I think this will mark our first mention of the Brotherhood this season and she will learn they had Arya. Gets her on track, and reminds the audience about them for the set up and payoff for LS.
3044	sati	2014-05-12	I'm a bit shocked OC is in this ep. But I guess they will make the most of it, perhaps Oberyn's offer is second to last scene and OC is the ending.
3045	Lord Carson	2014-05-12	I assume most of Stannis' army remained on Dragonstone and will meet him, Davos, and Saan in the North. I guess the ladies will travel with them.
3046	Ned's Sword	2014-05-12	Daario requesting to kill someone is more likely than sex. He says the exact words "let me do what I do best" after saying she should let him take of her enemies. It's possible, of course, that that was edited and he is asking for sex, but it seems less likely than a killing based on the preview.


Â 
Maybe they're starting the SotH subplot already? It seems too soon for my taste but you never know with D&D.
3047	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-12	I hope the episode starts out with Sansa's snow castle, then the intermediate scenes, and finally for the ending "Only Cat".
3048	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	I'm a bit shocked OC is in this ep. But I guess they will make the most of it, perhaps Oberyn's offer is second to last scene and OC is the ending.


Â 
So much has it/is going to happen in the last 3 episodes I am not that shocked. It would be overkill to add that on top. Doing it now lets it breath more. It does mean Sansa is pretty much done for the season (I don't think we will get much more from her plot), but a lot needs to get done. Not a bad place to go into the break either.
3049	Shitmouth the Wise	2014-05-12	I'm a little hazy, but could this be the episode where Ygritte dies? Â I'm guessing that she'll be killed by the little kid who the Thenns sent to Castle Black (they set it up by having him tell them he's a skilled archer).
3050	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-12	I'm a little hazy, but could this be the episode where Ygritte dies? Â I'm guessing that she'll be killed by the little kid who the Thenns sent to Castle Black (they set it up by having him tell them he's a skilled archer).


Â 
Positive Ygritte's death will happen in episode 9. This episode HAS to end with Only Cat.
3051	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	Â 
Positive Ygritte's death will happen in episode 9. This episode HAS to end with Only Cat.


Â 
Agreed, nothing major happens again with the Wall storyline until episode 9 when it ALL happens. And yes this episode should end with Only Cat.I like the idea of starting with the Snow Castle, having another scene in the middle and ending with Only Cat.
3052	pntrlqst	2014-05-12	I'm slightly shocked we're getting Lysa flying this early I genuinelly expected it to be in E10 right before the SH reveal. I wonder what will Sansa do for the remaing episodes since her ASOS arc is over. Anyways, it's good to see the snow castle come to life.
Â 
btw, I found this labeled as the recap of the episode:
Â 


Lords Declarant are cast.
3053	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-12	Dany and Daario are totally having sex. She has just had a hot stressful day meeting 214 supplicants. She has wanted Daario since Yunkai, the roses, the Meereneese champion. He's begging her to do something else, and she'll say no, finally give herself to him. The preview confirms it.
3054	lostinasia	2014-05-12	On Daario: could he asking for permission to kill Jorah? Given the extraordinary speed of communication in TV-Westeros/Essos, perhaps Tywin's plan (whatever that is) already comes to fruition, and Jorah's old informant status is revealed. Yes, that kind of speed is rather silly, but the promo already shows Sandor complaining to Arya that it's her fault he's now worth a bag of silver. So the new bounty on the Hound is already common knowledge.
Â 
I wonder if we'll see anything in the flames. I doubt it, but Jojen's vision earlier in the season has me hoping.
Â 
I'm a touch, just a touch, concerned about the new Mountain - the guy's appropriately huge, but in that brief scene his face simply looks too nice!
3055	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-12	I'm a touch, just a touch, concerned about the new Mountain - the guy's appropriately huge, but in that brief scene his face simply looks too nice!


Â 
As he's brutalizing peasants Â
3056	CaptainTheo	2014-05-12	I'm glad that Gregor is finally turning up again! Agreed that in the photo I saw of him, he looks way too amiable.
3057	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-12	I'm glad that Gregor is finally turning up again! Agreed that in the photo I saw of him, he looks way too amiable.


Â 
I'm sure he was legitimately thrilled to be doing itÂ
3058	Konradsmith	2014-05-12	I don't think Dany will be having sex with Daario in this episode. That pervy site, recapped,Â that myself and another posterÂ cited on last episode's thread would have mentioned that. A new Emilia Clarke sex scene would not have slipped under their radar. And they had the right info. about the Saan bathhouse scene last episode.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 12 May 2014 - 10:33 PM.
3059	Mark Antony	2014-05-12	another with no Bran?
3060	King Tommen	2014-05-12	The synopsis fragment: "Dany considers giving Daario a longer leash" is either about something that has nothing to do with sex/romance or alternatively something that's really, really about something sexual. My vote is for the former, not the latter.
3061	King Tommen	2014-05-12	another with no Bran? 


Â 
Wouldn't be surprised if we don't see Bran again until the finale. Blame Martin for barely writing any Bran chapters. We're going to be more or less done with his ADwD stuff by the end of this season.
Â 
What's kind of cool about the Bran storyline is that we have, I believe, reached the point where there has been absolutely no footage shown in any behind the scenes stuff or trailers of anything else from here on out. What happens to him now (outside of the fact that we know a CoTF and Bloodraven have been cast) is a mystery.
3062	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-12	I looked up the pervy site. Apparently Nathalie and Emilia will be nude in episode 8, and it'll be the last episode this year with nudity.
3063	iheartseverus	2014-05-12	I looked up the pervy site. Apparently Nathalie and Emilia will be nude in episode 8, and it'll be the last episode this year with nudity.


How legit is this?Â  Do we buy it--I thought it was pretty widely known that Emilia refused any more nudity?
3064	Maria26	2014-05-12	Emilia refused any more nudity? I don't believe that for a second. I don't knowÂ where this came from but I doubt that's the case. It's a job, she has said thatÂ she has no problems with nudity and that if she has to do, that's part of her job and she will.

					
					
							Edited by Maria26, 12 May 2014 - 11:29 PM.
3065	El Guapo	2014-05-12	Yeah that rumor was debunked last year.
3066	Colonel Green	2014-05-12	Do we buy it--I thought it was pretty widely known that Emilia refused any more nudity?


No, that was just speculation about the actress who supposedly refused to do any more nudity in the previous season.
3067	iheartseverus	2014-05-12	Emilia refused any more nudity? I don't believe that for a second. I don't where this came from but I doubt that's the case. It's a job, sha has said that hse has no problems with nudity and that if she has to do, that's part of her job and she will.

3068	Yanninho	2014-05-12	All your links are wrong, based on nothing but winds. Oona Chaplin mentioned an actress refused to appear naked anymore, yes. But we never had the confirmation that it was Emilia. I'm thinking more Sibel here, because Emilia was naked in S3, and Sibel wasn't.
Â 
Anyway, what's that pervy site ? I'm intrigued.

					
					
							Edited by Yanninho, 12 May 2014 - 11:57 PM.
3069	ejhawman	2014-05-13	I, too, am surprised Only Cat happens so soon; thought for sure they were going to simply finish off AFFC this season. But Daario's "Let me do what I do best" is from ADWD. So Dany's story is forging ahead.
Â 
Meanwhile, Jon's lags when it should be the most active. I was sure Ygritte would be dead by now. How much longer can she last? Does it really matter if she dies in a skirmish or in the main battle? Going for the main battle is too standard, too much the practice of TV and lesser authors, but this is TV, being controlled by lesser authors, so we don't get things too realistic.
Â 
Brienne has less screen time than I thought. Granted, her AFFC material is easily cuttable. I want to see her fight with Rorge and Biter in 8, then facing Stoneheart in 10.
Â 
Stannis is already halfway to the Wall; presumably his surviving forces are at Eastwatch by now and he only needs a few extra mercenaries to round them out. So the show seems to be trying to make his journey take a plausible amount of time.
Â 
On track for Oberyn to volunteer as Tryion's champion in 7, the trial in 8, the release by Jaime in 10. Pretty much as expected going into the season.
3070	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-13	Anyway, what's that pervy site ? I'm intrigued.


Â 
As you should be.Â
3071	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-13	Updated post. What I submitted for approval was basically a rough draft.
Â 
Daario thing is unlikely to be sex, yes, since HBO's website says no Strong Sexual Content this episode. Mind you, that doesn't completely write it off, but makes it less likely because I imagine their first time to be more... explicit?

Â 
I could add dozens more, but, point taken.

She was since nude on the West End, though. Aside from it being a tabloid rumour based on a throw away comment from Oona Chaplin, I'd say several ladies were more likely than Emilia, specifically Sibel
3073	Konradsmith	2014-05-13	^I hate to be the guy that always takes this thread in this direction. And I am sadly. Time and again. But I think Oona was referring to Esme Bianco.
Â 
As for the context of the expected scene in episode eight, Nathalie Emmanuel and some extras filmed scenes in a Croatian river. I think this will be the lead up to the scene where Drogon kills someone. We'll see a pastoral scene of some girls in the river and then we'll see Hazzea gobbled up.

3074	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-13	I think that the new lead Â for Brienne will probably lead Â to that fight scene where she Mike Tyson's somebody.
3075	Daenerys Must Die	2014-05-13	I'm pretty curious to see the sequence of events leading up to Oberyn declaring as Tyrion's champion..
Â 
Not just their meeting in his cell as the OP pointed out we are pretty much sure to see.. but surely this will be more towards the end of the episode as it's likely we'll get Tyrion pretty much giving up hope of finding a champion ..
Â 
Question's I have (show specific in regards to how the exposition will go)
Â 
- What are the logistics of the Mountain being back in KL all of the sudden? Best guess is that Cersei sent for him in advance just in case it came to this - because she was worried about Bronn being a bit of a wild card and it's not as if KL is pouring with legendary Kingsguard these days.
Â 
- Tywin's reaction to Gregor being Cercei's champion?
Â 
- How does Oberyn come to know of all of this? Does Cersei blurt it out in a SCM (not overly far fetched).. I'm mainly interested in his reaction.
Â 
These aren't really questions I'm asking you guys per se, as there are plenty of logical answers to each, but rather dynamics that may play a part in this being a very epic moment between: The Mountain being introduced and slaughtering innocents ... Tyrion resigned to the fact that he might have to fight on his own behalf... and Oberyn going HAM on everyone and declaring for Tyrion... it's cliche of course, but as long as it's well done/written I don't have too many qualms with a bit of cliche here and there.
3076	Nick_Scryer	2014-05-13	I think OP is wrong about The Hound taking off his armor to become less recognizable, if you look closely at the promo you can see Sandor in full armor holding his neck while Arya is stabbing something/someone that is taller than her. Then you see Sandor in rags with a big cut on his neck where his arm was previously covering.
Â 
Can't wait to find out for sure.
3077	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-13	I'm pretty curious to see the sequence of events leading up to Oberyn declaring as Tyrion's champion..

Â 
- How does Oberyn come to know of all of this? Does Cersei blurt it out in a SCM (not overly far fetched).. I'm mainly interested in his reaction.
Â 
These aren't really questions I'm asking you guys per se, as there are plenty of logical answers to each, but rather dynamics that may play a part in this being a very epic moment between: The Mountain being introduced and slaughtering innocents ... Tyrion resigned to the fact that he might have to fight on his own behalf... and Oberyn going HAM on everyone and declaring for Tyrion... it's cliche of course, but as long as it's well done/written I don't have too many qualms with a bit of cliche here and there.


I'm assuming that it'll be pretty well known that he will be champion, what with him slicing and dicing all the peasants out in the open like that.Â 
Â 
I'd say it was part of her plan when in the last episode she was trying to manipulate the Judges. Try your best to influence the trail, and if he chooses Trial by Combat, try to influence that Â as much as possible by getting strongest, most feared motherfucker in the realm as your champion.
3078	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-13	The Hound will find out that he has a bounty on his head because some people will try and kill him and take it
3079	Konradsmith	2014-05-13	That corpse may be Rorge. The ponytail looks like his did.
3080	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-13	I wonder if the rest of the Lannisters/their allies will have a discussion about what Oberyn representing Tyrion actually means (ie if he wins, Tyrion is free and angry, Oberyn has sided himself semi-openly against Tywin and holds Myrcella, whose crowning he may mention and they still need to deal with Joff's assassination, if he loses, Dorne will be PISSED. That scene would also be an opportunity for someone like Jaime to discuss Oberyn's experience and prestige as a warrior and fighter and maybe that he was a mercenary once, in the second sons which would interest viewers as a link in to Daario/Dany. They might even think he was working with Daario/Dany now! Which would be a great mislead)
3081	Newstar	2014-05-13	The Hound looks like he's got a nasty neck wound when he's out of his armour, and in another scene in the promo, he's holding his hand to his neck. Could this injury be The Wound that weakens him?

3082	Konradsmith	2014-05-13	^I think he'll face some Knights of the Vale in episode eight. But he could well be weakened from whatever fight this is.
3083	tyrell19	2014-05-13	Lysa, Selyse and Melisandre all in one episode!!!! Not to mention Gegor Clegane. Should be a good one. And "Only Cat" is my favourite chapter in the whole series and from what we have seen there going to do it justice.
3084	Xyzzy	2014-05-13	Are those peasants the Mountain is slaughtering? They looked like the dwarfs in Joffrey's pantomime to me. Is this where we get Penny?
3085	BrienneofQarth	2014-05-13	I'd love to see Penny, butÂ I don't think her scenes will really be necessary until after Tyrion's flight.Â 
Â 
I'm glad this episode is finally featuring the Mountain doing what he does best. I know he'sÂ been mentioned by Sandor and Oberyn, but I feel like the series has reduced the full impact of his evil-ness by not showing him more. It's not really the showrunners' fault as I know there Â have been casting issues. But I just feel that to give the Viper/Mountain clashÂ it's most profound impact, the Mountain needs to be more ofÂ the colossal swine he is in the books. Maybe this will be the place for it.
Â 
I'm sad about it, but I had my money on the 'snow castle' sequence not being given the same prominent last- placing that it was in aSoS. But I am surprised it's quite so soon though.Â This scene is just about my favourite of anything Martin ever writes (yet!). It's a beautiful piece of prose, but its just not dramatic enough to make good visual drama in the same way as dragons or walkers or, er, Â boobs. I really, really, really, really, really hope they at least try and do it justice, though.

Â 
They are not dwarfs, you can see among/behind them a couple of gold cloaks, and they are the same height as the peasants. They just seem like dwarfs, because the promo cuts to them from a shot of the huge Mountain!
3087	Mel_Rose	2014-05-13	^^I agree with you, I wanted it to be in the finale.
Â 
It makes some sense having it now, though. This season they are fond of these long sequences focusing on one story and they do work really well imo. So if you think what's coming in the finale, Tyrion escaping, talk with brother, Tywin's room, kill Shae, talk with daddy, kill daddy. We will also have the aftermath of the Wall battle possibly and the choosing, we will have the Bran stuff which will take a while, Arya leaving, the Uncat moment. If we inluded the whole Vale sequence, snow castle, talk with LF, Lysa jealous, Only Cat, shove, (poss blame someone else) ... well that would stretch the episode to breaking point - even at 65 mins running time. It is a shame but I'd rather they spend a lot of time on these events and not rush them or split them in little scenes.
Â 
The shot of the snow castle looks lovely and Lysa wonderfully hysterical, so I am hoping too that it will be as good as the other big moments we've seen.

People all are raving about Dinklage's performance in 4.6 (I found it a bit too much "demon monkey" tbh, but maybe that was the point) but I really loved the "if you want justice ..." snippet in the trailers with him weeping and am very excited for that.

I think it is. He does need to get injured pretty soon so that he can deteriorate enough to ask Arya for the gift.
3090	Annara Snow	2014-05-13	Sansa builds a snow castle resembling Winterfell and is threatened by a jealous aunt. Littlefinger rectifies the situation with a sharp shove. Unknown if Littlefinger kisses Sansa to ignite Lysa's fury (Aiden Gillen stated in an interview that the Littlefinger/Alayne relationship would be less creepy, more paternal.
And you believed that? I think Gillen was massively trolling.

Melisandre is definitely in finale. There is this shot of her in trailers where she watches something burn - there is ice behind her.
Â 
Considering how Mel is showing Selyse some powders I assume they are at Dragonstone. I'd love for writers to use this opportunity to troll Unsullied more and hint that Stannis is going to KL.

I think it make sense. It happens soon after Sansa arrives to Eyrie in the books as well. Don't really remember anything else happening other than the wedding at Fingers, snow castle and Moon door.Â 
Â 
In the later episodes, Lysa's death would be overshadowed by all the other (and for viewers more important) shit and would loose its dramatic impact. Besides the audience expects shock twists around the end but not around the middle.Â

Why would they remove the kiss? I can't think of a single good reason. It's not like they're trying to make LF likable the way they were trying to make Tyrion, so why weaken Sansa's story again and rob her of the moment when she is faced with both LF's creepiness and Lysa's madness, calls LF on his shit and speaks for herself to Lysa?

It's not about the age of actors, rather the characters. That's why they aged Dany.

3110	iheartseverus	2014-05-13	I think they can do any number of shots that will make it clear LF is creeping on Sansa, even without an actual kiss.Â  He could be standing too close to her, as he always does anyway, sort of leaning into her *shudder* and then reach out and stroke her hair, or whatever.Â  That should be enough to enrage Lysa (and me!).

Adults actors kiss underage actresses all the time in film and TV. Lolita with Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain, Phantom of the Opera with Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler/Patrick Wilson, even My So-Called Life (because Claire Danes was 15 and Jared Leto was in his 20s) are some of the examples. The most extreme one is 12-year old Kirsten Dunst kissing Brad Pitt in Interview with the Vampire.

Â 
The idea that LF kissing Sansa is "too much" is currently just in fans' heads, and I really doubt that this is the reason why Jorah hasn't kissed Dany, what with her having all that nudity and sex scenes with Momoa and, no doubt, future hot sex scenes with Huisman and a non-hot sex scene with Fry.
Â 
Emilia was never underage, she's in her mid 20s, and neither is Dany on the show.
Â 
They seem to be doing Jorah/Dany very differently on the show in general. Jorah is generally nicer and less pushy compared to the book.

Well, that's why I talked about characters, not actors...
But some of your examples do apply to both, indeed. I suppose the one with Kirsten Dunst was less shocking because she was actually a very old vampire in the body of a child that needed that sort of stuff and was dying to get some love, due to her curse. It fitted well with the story and character development, I guess.

I don't think it's crucial for Lysa to lose it and attack Sansa, but I think it's pretty important to Sansa's arc and her relationship with Petyr.

But given the foreshadowing of Sansa slaying a Giant, and how creepy LF seemed in the season opener, I'd be surprised if they do change it too much.

Stop making up excuses to whinge about something you haven't even seen. Honestly. Do you not all get sick of crying about the show? Especially things that haven't even been broadcast yet. 
Anyway... IMO, the Stoneheart reveal won't be through Merret Frey but through Brienne.

Â 
There is no such legislation, at least in the US. Unless you are talking about pornography (actual sex, or at the very least child nudity in a sexual context). There are however, self imposed network censorship rules that are very context laden but a kiss between a teenage female character an an older man would not violate those rules. Whether there is a kiss or not really depends on whether the LF actor was correct in saying that they are taking the relationship in a more paternal turn then in the books. I myself would have no problem with such a direction as it would color LF in a much grayer tone then having him obviously having the hots for Sansa.

I know for a fact that they have an upcoming fight at the Vale (where i expect the Hound to get his wound) that was shot in Iceland by Alex Graves (he was the one talking about it on the BTS video). That means that the fight is either in episode 8 or 10 (both directed by Alex Graves).
Â 
I could see the Hound picking up a small wound in episodeÂ 7 and then the wound getting worse after the knights of the vale attack.
Â 
I just cant see them having the fight and Arya leaving in the same episode. The fight needs to happen and the Hounds wound needs to fester, which should take a few days (TV time). Arya then needs to leave him and then board a ship (which means she will probably leave him at the start of episode 10 and then show up again later to board the ship). If the fight happens in episode 10, then Arya will need to leave the Hound straight away so she can get on the ship before the end of the episode

Â 
I'm inclined to agree...the wound needs to happen in either E7 or E8 (what you're saying makes 8 seem likelier). They may have a skirmish though; we know Tywin just offered 100 stags for his head, so I'm sure people are going to be trying.

3138	Natalie Underfoot	2014-05-13	I'm glad "Only Cat" is coming. 1. I've been telling everyone how much shit was going to go down this season and I think they no longer believe me and this would be a nice precursor to the shitstorm that is about to roll in and 2. I would imagine that with so many people being set on different paths for next season it would be an interesting shot to see Sansa lying to the Lord Declarants (and siding with Littlefinger in a way) in the final episode just as we have Arya heading to Braavos, Jon coming into his own at the wall and Bran meeting Bloodraven. Â 
Â 
Couple that with Tyrion escaping, maybe Balon finally falling off that damn bridge, Ramsey being legitimized and we have a nice montage of the changing directions of the show. Â

This is a good way of looking at it; the start of the shitstorm (also a good spot for a 2-week break). I listened to a podcast earlier where someone mentioned that we're going to be losing a well-known character every episode from here through the finale. I think Lysa is a great way to kick it off.Â

3142	jentario	2014-05-13	How legit is this?Â  Do we buy it--I thought it was pretty widely known that Emilia refused any more nudity?


That is utter bullshit. It is a actress in the show, but certainly not Emilia. They just specualte it's her because "she was naked a lot in season 1 and she isn't anymore" which is bullshit. What would she do, fuck the ground? They only just introduced Daario as a love interest, and only now they have the opportunity for more naked Dany. That bath scene in season 3 is proof that Emilia isn't the one in question. I am actually pretty sure that the named actress is Sibel Kekilly- she plays a character that's all about sex and bared her breasts only in season 1. And it would make sense for her since she's probably trying to escape her porn background.
3143	Hangover of the Morning	2014-05-13	Any idea if/when we get the Tommen/Marge wedding. I guess it might just happen off-screen for budgetary purposes Â Also Loras/Cersei was proposed ages ago so it is time to get a resolution to it.

Â 
I don't see how, though. Cersei said "in a fortnight" to Tywin, and I'm pretty sure everything through Tywin's death will be in that time-frame. Which means Marg/Tommen will likely be married off-screen in between the seasons and Cersei will cancel her marriage to Loras.

I'm pretty sure Tywin will just die before it happens. Then Loras will come to Cersei "so wifey, when we gettin' mawied?" and she'll bitchslap him say "fuck off, you pillowbiter".
3146	Arkash	2014-05-13	Wouldnt surprise me to have the wedding in 7 or 8. Doesnt need to be a very long scene. Just show the ceremony in the sept and some people congratulating Tommen and Marge after that. Enough said, done in three minutes.
3147	Hoodwinked	2014-05-13	So when everyone keeps saying Cat, does that mean we will finally see Lady Stoneheart?
3148	iheartseverus	2014-05-13	^ When everybody talks about Cat, they're talking about 'only Cat', Littlefinger's words about who he loves, as he shoves Lysa out the moon door.Â  Usually, when talking about Catelyn as Lady Stoneheart, its abbreviated 'LS.'Â  Two different scenes.

Luckily, the Lannisters are running out of money so it makes sense to make it cheap from a production standpoint. Tywin already said it would be low key.Â
3150	Yanninho	2014-05-13	The Only Cat being in Ep 7 makes sense. It reminds people of Catelyn, so when they see LSH, they will be even more amazed.
Â 
For the Arya/Hound story, I see it that way :
Â 
Ep 7 : gift of mercy scene
Ep 8 : big fight, The Hound gets injured and Arya leaves him
Ep 10 : she embarks for Braavos
3151	Arkash	2014-05-13	So, we will have major deaths every episode for the rest of the season.
Â 
- Lysa.
- Oberyn.
- Ygritte + others.
- Tywin.
Â 
Well, the end of the season is gonna rock !Â 
Â 
And episode 7 and 8 seems really heavy in terms of different storylines. For episode 7 we should be getting :
- King's Landing.
- The Eyrie.
- The Wall.
- Brienne and Pod.
- Arya and the Hound.
- Dragonstone.
- Meereen.
Â 
That's a lot !
3152	sati	2014-05-13	What do we think the clue is Brienne finds this ep? What if she hears of Brotherhood killing the Freys and figures they are doing it for a Stark and assumes they have one of the girls and decides to persue them?
Â 
It would be awesome to get another BwB mention this ep (apart from Arya's kill list)
3153	Citabel	2014-05-13	another with no Bran? 


Â 
He is casted on imdb, but Dickie is casted on e10, so the episode casting could be a bit mixed up.

3155	redriver	2014-05-13	^I hate to be the guy that always takes this thread in this direction. And I am sadly. Time and again. But I think Oona was referring to Esme Bianco.
Â 
As for the context of the expected scene in episode eight, Nathalie Emmanuel and some extras filmed scenes in a Croatian river. I think this will be the lead up to the scene where Drogon kills someone. We'll see a pastoral scene of some girls in the river and then we'll see Hazzea gobbled up.


We don't object to humans being eaten alive as long as,God forbid,there are no nipples.

I assume the trial by combat has put that on hold, and they'll plan to execute Tyrion before the wedding(s) take place.

Nah, it's Ygritte. It's got to be.
Oh yeah, almost forgot about that! If it's Oberyn, we'll all vomit along with Tyrion.
I'm still quite confident that they're changing Oberyn's death to split in half. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his greatsword.
I don't recall that from the books, so they wouldn't put that in without good reason

Â 
Why does it have to be Ygritte?
Â 
That line about splitting her in half was there to indicate the horrific way in which she died. Oberyn's death is horrifying and I dare say the way in which he dies is a big factor in the shock - it's not something as 'simple' as being killed with a sword.

3161	Father of Dragons	2014-05-13	Why does it have to be Ygritte?

They've built up the Jon/Ygritte relationship so much. Lysa's been in like five episodes - the matter or shock of her death makes no difference. Oberyn, whether he's a badass or not, is only a recurring character who will only appear in 7 episodes compared to the probable 15 episodes that the major character Ygritte will. And let's be honest, could it really be Tywin?
3162	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-13	I hope The Mountain at least pulls him down and snaps his neck..(or something like that) Has to be 'up close and personal'
I don't buy that even The Mountain could split him in half via sword all while being literally impaled to the ground on his back.
Wouldn't be much of a surprise either.. I mean, Oberyn could dodge the sword... But there's no escaping Gregor's grip.

The slow-mo could work for Lysa but it'd be cheesy.
Â 
It could be Ygritte pierced by arrows but that's done and redone.
Â 
Tywin's death doesnt need slow-mo at all.
Â 
Same thing for Shae. Whatever way they chose it to be.
Â 
Oberyn, it matters of how they choose to portray it.

You've convinced me. I honestly just forgot that Gregor was wounded by Oberyn at all (obviously I remember the aftermath and his poisoned wound, but not what actually happened in the fight)

I'm not sure what the number of episodes a person is in has to do with the effective use of slow motion...The only compelling argument for Ygritte is that it's Marshall's ep and he used it on the show before

Well, I'd meant that if they appeared in more episodes, then they're a more important character (not necessarily true in some cases), and they're therefore more deserving of a slo-mo death.
Anyway, I don't want to get into a page after page argument like the Sansa/Littlefinger one, so I'll just wait and see.
3168	~No One~	2014-05-13	What do we think the clue is Brienne finds this ep?
 sati , I think it'll be that  the Hound has to remove/abandon his helm, and that our dynamic duo of Pod & Brienne find it  (italicizes b/c just speculation).
It would follow that the Hound hears of the bounty in his head, and removes his armor. Yes, I know his facial scarring is what gives him away, but plot-wise, if he leaves his helm, then one of the Brave Companions find it, Brienne can Mike Tyson him later, in self-defense (confirmed scene)

Â 
I'm thinking the Marge/Tommen wedding will happen in 5x01 to set up the King's Landing events for the season. Kevan will probably show up and want Cersei to go through with the Loras marriage while he takes overs as Regent and she will tell him she's not doing it. Or they may have to push it to episode 2 if they have to do a lot of aftermath from Tywin's death in the opener.

3172	Father of Dragons	2014-05-13	I'm kinda confused, does Brienne even know one of the girls is with Hound?
That could be the "new lead". She may encounter Anguy or Thoros and they could mention the Hound and Arya (obviously not by name) but how they would possibly find out, I've got no idea.
Alternatively, they could visit the inn that Arya and the Hound were at kn episode one, but this might be used for the biting "off a man's ear, and spit it in his face -Gwendoline laugh-"
3173	Arkash	2014-05-13	Imo, the new lead would be meeting with an ex-Brother without Banner telling them that they had Arya once.
3174	sati	2014-05-13	Imo, the new lead would be meeting with an ex-Brother without Banner telling them that they had Arya once.

3175	Father of Dragons	2014-05-13	Perhaps someone who mentions that Brotherhood has a new leader and that's why he left.... 
That'd be good - I'd like that but who would it be? Well, it could only be Anguy, but I can't see him just leaving Thoros alone with the extras. Unless Gendry has made his way back, which is incredibly unlikely.

I think it's Anguy. The actor who played Gendry said, from what I recall, that he is not in this season. Anguy is the only one we know other than Thoros and Beric, and Beric is dead.
Â 
But we'll see it any of that happens next ep anyways 
Â 
But it has to be something secretive, right? As they weren't even in the promo. If we saw Anguy in promo we could already shout that the final scene is confirmed.

Although it won't happen, I'd be pretty happy if it was Gendry. That way he could be talking to a "deserter" and say stuff like "I didn't come back to see some crazy woman hang a bunch of Freys!" and Brienne could notice his resemblance to Renly and listen in.
This entire conversation about the BwB is all speculation so I don't know why I'm getting so obsessed by it

I really cannot wait to see LS (I'm dying to see how she will look) on the show so any hint pointing to her appearing this year makes me insanely happy.
Â 
BTW guys, Martin is gonna be a guest on Conan tonight.
3181	CaptainTheo	2014-05-13	Really looking forward to this next episode. The final (Sansa) chapter in book #3 is very much my favourite chapter of the entire series of ASOIAF, even the first few pages when Sansa wakes up and goes outside, Martin's descriptions in it are so beautiful, poetic and sad - at his absolute best. I assumed it would be in episode #10 as it is pretty-much the close of the book but I guess that so much happens at the end that they had to move some things around. This should play out spectactularly on the screen.
Â 
I always assumed that Littlefinger would kiss Sansa on TV as he does in the book as it is a powerful moment. Sansa has after all been kissed before once, in season #1 episode #6 by Joffrey (in front of Septa Mordane); admittedly he was only four years older. If they keep this in it would certainly would show the full extent of Littlefinger's creepiness. Not that he hasn't been creepy anyway, although next to Lysa he seems pretty normal!

Same! She won't have scars on her face, I guess, but I wonder if they're going to keep the fact that she needs to hold her throat closed to speak. That was both a fantastic detail and highly disturbing.

Jon Snow and the Night's Watch face a big challenge.
Episode 4.10 - The Children
Circumstances change after an unexpected arrival from north of the Wall; Dany must face harsh realities; Bran learns more about his destiny; Tyrion sees the truth about his situation.
Â 
New info: I doubt it, but Stannis possibly may not arrive at the battle until episode ten (very small chance, of course). Sansa will be featured in episode eight. Moat Cailin is in episode eight. Mole's Town attack is in episode eight.

Unexpected visitors arrive in Moleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Town;

I hope nothing bad happens to Gilly!Â
3186	sati	2014-05-13	Â 
Same! She won't have scars on her face, I guess, but I wonder if they're going to keep the fact that she needs to hold her throat closed to speak. That was both a fantastic detail and highly disturbing.


I made this a while back - http://31.media.tumb...gfbkmo2_500.jpg - with the lack of scars I'm hoping they will make her really pale and do something scary with her eyes.
Â 
The throat thing was awesome, I guess they can make that happen with some prosthetics or something.
3187	Jasta11	2014-05-13	We got snow castle and Only Cat, plus Oberyn championing Tyrion which is another chance to have two great actors together. That's enough to be exited about.
Â 
Also, the Mountain's casting is spot-on. This looks like the kind of guy you do not want to make angry.
3188	Colonel Green	2014-05-13	Huh, Sansa and Littlefinger are in episode 8 after all.Â  I thought that there realistically needed to be some kind of aftermath to "Only Cat" if it wasn't going to be a season-ender, but it didn't seem like there was going to be anything.
3189	~No One~	2014-05-13	I'm kinda confused, does Brienne even know one of the girls is with Hound?Â 
No, but that could be the lead. Total spec. It might be Bri/Pod finding that farmer, him describing the Hound, then Bri spec'ing that it's Sansa. I'm pretty sure everyone in both the show and the books (up to ASOS) thinks that Arya is dead.
Â That could be the "new lead". She may encounter Anguy or Thoros and they could mention the Hound and Arya (obviously not by name) but how they would possibly find out, I've got no idea.
Alternatively, they could visit the inn that Arya and the Hound were at kn episode one, but this might be used for the biting "off a man's ear, and spit it in his face -Gwendoline laugh-"Â Â 
I like this! Great way to bring back the BWB. Any idea if those guys are in this season?Imo, the new lead would be meeting with an ex-Brother without Banner telling them that they had Arya once.

^Or this.
3190	~No One~	2014-05-13	Huh, Sansa and Littlefinger are in episode 8 after all.Â  I thought that there realistically needed to be some kind of aftermath to "Only Cat" if it wasn't going to be a season-ender, but it didn't seem like there was going to be anything.

Sorry for the double post :/
I think this is where we meet the Vale Lords. IIRC, they appear in 2 eps. I think this will either be some of the Feast story fleshed out, or made up stuff.
3191	Hodor H'ghar	2014-05-13	So, is anyone getting any kind of hint from these synopsis' that we may get LS after all this season?Â

I don't think we ever got an appearance count for any of them, just that they appear under the direction of Alex Graves...which describes both episode 8 and 10, so there's no way to know.
3193	King Tommen	2014-05-13	I'd have a hard time believing they'd have Sansa in E7, E8 and E10 when E7 is Only Cat. There doesn't seem to be enough material to support that but stranger things have happened I guess.
3194	Colonel Green	2014-05-13	I'd have a hard time believing they'd have Sansa in E7, E8 and E10 when E7 is Only Cat. There doesn't seem to be enough material to support that but stranger things have happened I guess.


All plots get something in the finale, even if it's comparatively minor.Â  In terms of material, I don't think that's a problem, since we already know the Lords are showing up, which means they're going at least partway into AFFC.
Â 
Episode 8:Â  Wouldn't be surprised if this opens the episode, showing the aftermath of Lysa's death and however they handle Sansa's reaction to Littlefinger (something GRRM kind of skipped over in the books).Â  Have Littlefinger note that the other lords will be coming to investigate (if they're keeping that Royce has seen Sansa in the past, have her mention that).
Episode 10:Â  The Lords arrive, the scene plays out however far the writers want to take this plot.

Well Littlefinger is mentioned in the episode 8 synopsis. Does not mean Sansa is in it, but they will be at the Eyrie.Â
3196	King Tommen	2014-05-13	Well Littlefinger is mentioned in the episode 8 synopsis. Does not mean Sansa is in it, but they will be at the Eyrie.Â 


Â 
Yeah, I'm wondering if that's where her story ends this season as opposed to going back there yet again in E10. if this holds true, Sansa would be in E1, E2, E3, E5, E7, E8 and E10. That's a lot.
3197	Colonel Green	2014-05-13	Yeah, I'm wondering if that's where her story ends this season as opposed to going back there yet again in E10. if this holds true, Sansa would be in E1, E2, E3, E5, E7, E8 and E10. That's a lot.


She was in eight episodes last season too.Â  The show has never once left a plot/location out of the series finale; it's meant to orient everybody as to where things will be going next year.
3198	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-13	Well Littlefinger is mentioned in the episode 8 synopsis. Does not mean Sansa is in it, but they will be at the Eyrie.Â 


Â 
True, but most likely she is involved considering what happens the previous episode.

Â 
While that is true, they've never done a finale like this one either. It's not the typical denouement to the huge E9 climax. They have to cram in a ton of stuff into this episode and also give it the necessary time to depict several story climaxes that require a decent amount of build up.
Â 
I wouldn't be shocked if they had a quick Sansa check-in nor would I be surprised if they wrapped things up with her in E8.
3200	Hangover of the Morning	2014-05-13	Â

Â 
Â 
LOL. You must be a politician. Such a diplomatic answer.Â
3201	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-13	The whole reason they probably included Sansa in episode 8 is because they just don't want the cliffhanger in episode 7 and then wait for 4 weeks until we find out what happens to Sansa.Â 
Â 
Regarding episode 10, she probably will be there, even if it's just a quick scene. Sure it is cramped but let's not forget: finale is 66 minutes long. The longest episode.Â

Â 
The entire pacing of this season is new. Â They are visiting less locations and having longer scenes each episode. Â I really love that they are letting certain sequences breath and aren't trying to check into certain subplots unless necessary. Â
3203	The Lizard King	2014-05-13	I'm pretty sure Tywin will just die before it happens. Then Loras will come to Cersei "so wifey, when we gettin' mawied?" and she'll bitchslap him say "fuck off, you pillowbiter".


Â
3204	pntrlqst	2014-05-13	Episode eight will be the Lords Declarant questioning Petyr with Corbray drawing his sword.
Â 
Ep.10, Sansa will guess that Corbray is in Petyr's employ and Petyr reveals his plan to eventually reveal her as heir to Winterfell.

I really don't think they're going to space that out; more likely they'll just have Sansa ask him about it after the lords leave the room, based on their typical pacing.
3206	Aldi_AA	2014-05-13	Â 
Why does it have to be Ygritte?
Â 
That line about splitting her in half was there to indicate the horrific way in which she died. Oberyn's death is horrifying and I dare say the way in which he dies is a big factor in the shock - it's not something as 'simple' as being killed with a sword.The thing is the mountains line won't make sense if he says 
"Elia of Dorne. I killed her screaming whelp. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her fucking head in. Like this."
Because she had a different death in the show of course they can change that line or cut it or they change oberyn's death.

Mel is taking a bath, apparently
3211	Konradsmith	2014-05-14	^Well from what we know, Mel has a bath and Selyse visits her. In the promo we see a shelf with some of Mel's powders etc. which Carice said in an interview that we would see this season. Also in the promo, Mel instructs Selyse in seeing stuff in the flames.
Â 
EDIT: Ninja'd by HairGrowsBack.
Â 
Interestingly about Mel's bath, she doesn't have her necklace thingmy on, which might disprove certain theories surrounding it. Or it could beÂ a mistake.

Some scene between Selyse and Mel. Apparently Mel shares a vision (maybe foreshadowing the battle at the wall) and something about her powers of manipulation. Have no idea what that means. Maybe they introduce her glamour ability? Your guess is as good as mine.Â

I really don't know about this : the show never put anyÂ emphasis on the necklace, but that doesn't mean it has/will have no importance (in the books at least). Or it is precisely what it means ^^
3214	MercyTheBlindUglyLittleCat	2014-05-14	I think the OP nailed it. Good work mate.
3215	Konradsmith	2014-05-14	True enough, HairGrowsBack, and maybe they were in such a rush to get Carice naked (and who could blame them? ) that they overlooked this detail.
Â 
Or maybe she'll get out of the tub and be very scarred etc. and then put on her neck-thingmy and look her (lovely) self again. That might be a bit over-the-top magic-wise for some viewers but I'm pretty sure Mel's up to some shit in that ballpark in book canon. Isn't it also theorized that she's really old?

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 14 May 2014 - 03:52 AM.
3216	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-14	^YesÂ a lot of people believe her story resembles somehow that of a fairytale evil/queen witch who performs a charm to hide her true appearance (ie : ugly or old); it's possible and if done right not necessarily corny (what you suggest could work).
ExplanationÂ one seems very likely as well - can't say the lack of necklace would be my main focus re. this scene either.

No way, they were trying not to do that the whole season  Mel is in finale at the Wall, I'm sure of that.
3223	kjm16216	2014-05-14	Â 
I'm thinking the Marge/Tommen wedding will happen in 5x01 to set up the King's Landing events for the season. Kevan will probably show up and want Cersei to go through with the Loras marriage while he takes overs as Regent and she will tell him she's not doing it. Or they may have to push it to episode 2 if they have to do a lot of aftermath from Tywin's death in the opener.


Agreed.Â  Plus it will be great for ratings.Â  The Unsullied will think more people are going to die at the wedding.

Ah, ok, thanks. I'm sure I read 2 eps somewhere, but it's good practice to take what you read with a grain of salt I'd have a hard time believing they'd have Sansa in E7, E8 and E10 when E7 is Only Cat. There doesn't seem to be enough material to support that but stranger things have happened I guess.

Stranger things  have  happened! but I'd find it a stretch to have OC, then nothing until ep 10. It could be that the opening to ep 8 is a "resolution" to that cliffhanger, whereby Mord (or any other Marillion substitute) is blamed and taken away/put in a sky cell. 
Then maybe we see fallout with the Lords Declarant in ep 10.
I'd be surprised if LF revealed his plans to Sansa this season... that is the end of her DWD arc. But again, TVland is a different creature.

perhaps the same type of excitement a parent has when their child takes up, and excels in the sport that they used to play. Littlefinger's "sport" is the game of thrones,Sansa's growing prowess as a potential player may cause his excitement. He thinks he has a protege....taking out the pedo perv vibe may add some nuance to the tension between the two. In the book Littlefinger the obvious creep seems, well creepy and Sansa picks up on that vibe and readers pick up on her discomfort. I personally am looking for her inevitable escape/betrayal of littlefinger. Showing it this way and building some type of faux parental bond would make Sansa's distaste for LF seem a bit more out of the blue.

I agree with that, I just think that they're saying his excitement at whatever event occurs is a "parental pride" type of excitement vs a sexual excitement. But you're right he's been just as skeevy this yr as any other time in the show series.

No doubt there are a lot of sick killers in the world, but outside of war, killing peasants in the city doesn't seem like something you're allowed to do with impunity.Â  Now maybe there aren't 10 gold cloaks willing to arrest him, but I'm not sure how you pretend to have a government if you have someone going around killing people in public without consequence.

doesn't it look like Arya will be killing more people this ep based on the promo? how many people has she killed till now? 3-4?Â 


I think this episode may introduce the "gift of mercy" thingy, hence her finishing off that guy.
And I believe she's killed 4 people so far.
3254	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-14	No doubt there are a lot of sick killers in the world, but outside of war, killing peasants in the city doesn't seem like something you're allowed to do with impunity.Â  Now maybe there aren't 10 gold cloaks willing to arrest him, but I'm not sure how you pretend to have a government if you have someone going around killing people in public without consequence.


Â 
This
Â 
That's why I'm thinking they must have committed some sort of crime, and undoubtedly it will be a dubious one.Â

Â 
True, but some have hypothesized that Cersei is having him do it in view of Tyrion's cell window as means of intimidation.Â 
Â 
The Queen Regent probably could order this, and since it would be out of view of the rest of King's Landing, no one finds out about it.Â
3260	DaveyJoe	2014-05-14	Cersei will probably come up with some treason like they were speaking against the king or attending one of those controversial puppet shows.
3261	Needle's Pointy End	2014-05-14	perhaps the same type of excitement a parent has when their child takes up, and excels in the sport that they used to play. Littlefinger's "sport" is the game of thrones,Sansa's growing prowess as a potential player may cause his excitement. He thinks he has a protege....taking out the pedo perv vibe may add some nuance to the tension between the two. In the book Littlefinger the obvious creep seems, well creepy and Sansa picks up on that vibe and readers pick up on her discomfort. I personally am looking for her inevitable escape/betrayal of littlefinger. Showing it this way and building some type of faux parental bond would make Sansa's distaste for LF seem a bit more out of the blue.


Â 
Â Agree. I see Sansa taking Littlefingers advise about keep your enemies guessing to heart and I think soon after she came to terms that Petyr set her up for Joffery's death, she realized he was her enemy. An enemy who cares for her for some odd reason.Â 
Â 
I too agree that Littlefinger isn't interested in doinking Sansa and making babies with her. I think he thinks of Sansa as the daughter he may have had with Cat had things gone differently when he was younger and he wishes to treat her like his own. That means pass on all of his cunning to her.Â
3262	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-14	Â 
already? i didnt expect any of that to happen till the wedding talks with Hizzy come in to play...
Â 
Â 
definitely...Tywin sending letter with intention of getting intercepted and causing problems in Dany's camp...loose a battle adviser, exile the already exiled!Â 
Â 
it is an interesting deviation from the book...i've been confused/worried about this since the Artsan story line was cut...when Grey Worm sneaked in to Meereen, i gave up on Jorah's exile...but this works in pretty well...Master Manipulator..Big Daddy TywinÂ  


I like the idea that given time, Tywin would have sabotaged Dany and her plans from half way across the world, without even leaving the Red Keep. The man's a legend.

Â 
In this episode? I assumed it was going to happen in his conversation with Oberyn, given the context of the line, but why would Tyrion start weeping? Weeping is something he would more likely do after he's lost the trial by combat.

Â 
exactly...the show version would make it seem, had Tywin survived, he could have easily handled Dany from half a world away without even breaking a sweat...
Â 
he might actually have been able to do in the books as well if he set his gaze on Dany like in the show...in the books, it seemed more along the lines that he didnt believe or care because she wasnt a real threat...
Â 
an unsullied friend of mine is soooooooo impressed with this manipulating skills, specially after the last Jaime/Tywin scene, he started wondering if Tywin actually had some part with LF and Olenna in Joff's poisoning....

I thought the same thing, but it might fit if he tries to get Bronn to fight for him, but then Bronn refuses.
It might be that his comment to Jamie "don't count me out yet, brother" (paraphrased) is just before he asks Bronn. Bronn says no, then Oberyn goes to see Tyrion, who by then has lost all hope.

I wonder if it's the final realization that his father really is okay with him dying because he allows Cersei to pick The Mountain. That he believed it would be a kingsguard member and that the choice of the Mountain is causing the despair?
3270	Le Cygne	2014-05-14	Littlefinger thinks of Sansa as a daughter....... right. I know some of you think Sansa's chapters are boring, but did you miss the part where he kissed her on the lips for a long time? That alone, is one of those signs.If a story involves kissing or fucking, even if it's just being said, there's a good chance the man in question doesn't think of her as a daughter or sister (Jaime Lannister excepted).GRRM writes age gap stories all the time, he said Dany/Drogo (13/30) was a romance, and just wrote one for Nettles/Damon (16/49).

Me: https://www.youtube....BXPAeE#t=01m46s ; I will accept no substitutes.


Â 
YES! I love that dramatic song they did last season - it's perfect for an "Only Cat" ending to this episode!
Â 


To get back a little on Sansa/LF topic, there's another interview with Aidan Gillen where he says: Â "What his relationship with Sansa becomes is quite interesting. I don't want to give too much away, but her character and personality is surprising, and that really excites me. Or rather, it excites Littlefinger."Â 
Â 
Imho, this "excitement" doesn't really fit that father/daughter relationship he was talking about before.
Â 


Â 
If something 'excites' Littlefinger it's power / money driven. He's excited by killing for power in a very secretive way. Remember, this is the guy who provided whores to a 'very special client with particular tastes' (Joffrey) so he's excited by some seriously f*d up stuff too - he runs a whore house but doesn't partake in the goods that we ever see. Being 'excited' by Sansa is likely eating up paternal control over her that could lead to more. He wants more but the powerplay excites him most of all.
Â 


Â 
Â I too agree that Littlefinger isn't interested in doinking Sansa and making babies with her. I think he thinks of Sansa as the daughter he may have had with Cat had things gone differently when he was younger and he wishes to treat her like his own. That means pass on all of his cunning to her.Â 


Â 
I don't think you read the same book as I did then because Littlefinger made it abundantly clear what he was after from Sansa in the book and it wasn't just a 'daughter' though that's what the rest of the world would think.

I did not get this impression from the book at all.
To me it seems like LF is projecting his thwarted romance with Cat onto his relationship with Sansa; he could never have to mother but the daughter will be his... Whether this is a romantic/sexual relationship or just power over her.
Â 


I don't think they'll show the kiss... No reason other than they don't want to bother with telling her story.


Im very hopeful for the kiss. The have been upping LF's creep factor this season, it has to pay off. Especially since he looked so 'normal' next to Lysa last week.

3276	Le Cygne	2014-05-15	All that's needed to move Littlefinger's plot along is for Lysa to get jealous, and we saw how easy that was.
Â 
One thing that would have been nice is a hint of what's going on here in the books, if anything:
Â 
When Sansa opened her eyes again, she was on her knees. She did not remember falling. It seemed to her that the sky was a lighter shade of grey.
3277	Cubarey	2014-05-15	"Especially since he looked so 'normal' next to Lysa last week."
Â 
An OTHER would look normal next to Lysa! I mean she is totally batshit both in the books and in the TV series. I think the LF character wants to bang Sansa but gets totally off on making her a total schemer, like she is his daughter of the spirit if not of the flesh. Further I do not think that LF thinking of Sansa as his daughter would stop him from wanting to bed her. He is a sicko in many ways and the intermixing of power and sex totally gets him off.

  True. It was kind of nice to see someone surprise LF last week though. Any opportunity for the smug to be wiped off his face.
Â 
I cannot wait to see LF get all up in Sansa's personal space again.Â
3279	Le Cygne	2014-05-15	Still thinking what's left, since they like to match up scenes (way too much), Sansa is at the Eyrie, and Arya is headed there, will they have one see the other?Â  Like they did with Jon and Bran.Â  And if so, who would see who.

I don't think Arya and the Hound will pass the Bloody Gate (if they go this far), so it's not very likely, as Sansa is confined at the Eyrie.
3281	Le Cygne	2014-05-15	Maybe warging could play a part.Â  And what about that crow following Arya and Sandor on the Trident ("the only sound was the river").Â  That's got to mean something, too.

I think if that happens it may be in E08... Sansa has quite a bit to fit into E07, with the snow castle, kiss (fingers crossed), Lysa losing her shit, and finally only cat.Â 
Maybe in E08 while she is staring out the moon door reflecting about what took place in the previous episode...
3285	Father of Dragons	2014-05-15	Why is the Hound blaming Arya for the stags on his head? The only thing she did was tell him to go into the inn. She didn't make him attack, or tell him to leave King's Landing in the first place. After all, he grabbed Arya and took her away on his roadtrip, she definitely didn't ask.
Also, I'm surprised news reaches Meereen faster than the Riverlands. The inn fight was in episode one, Daenerys took Meereen in episode four.

The Eyrie is much too far from that gate. Definitely in the books (maybe a day's ride?), but also in the show in ep. 5 where LF and Sansa enter the gate and the camera zooms out, Eyrie is seen way in the distance. No chance of seeing a person from that far (not to mention the gate is in a narrow canyon).
3287	Chloe.a.thomson	2014-05-15	Well I suppose Dany taking Meereen is a pretty big deal and so sailors, traders ect will be spreading it pretty quickly..

I'm pretty sure the rumours of dragons were only heard in Kings's Landing in A Feast for Crows. Correct me if I'm wrong
3289	Chebyshov	2014-05-15	Or, you know....show logic


Â 
It's more this, but Bryan Cogman gave an interview where he said that bringing up Dany in the Westerosi theater was a way to tie in her plot-line to the others. She so out of sight of the other characters, and is now planting in Meereen, that I think they wanted us to feel like there was same stake in her game. I actually agree with that decision. Plus, given how much travel there is between the Free Cities and Westeros, and how much the Free Cities depend on Slaver's Bay, it actually is surprising to me that talk of the dragons within Westeros wasn't really in the first three books.

Tywin heard about them actually in the books, but didn't believe it for a second.
Â 
I actually facepalmed when he said in the show that "dragons didn't win wars for centuries, men did" to dismiss the threat. It doesn't make any sense... Dragons stopped winning war because dragons... disappeared. Such nonsense coming from Tywin is unbelievable.

Â 
I think the show set up Tywin treating it as a threat the same way he treated Robb Stark. He's going to take care of it but by making deals and writing letters to initiate an internal plot in her camp as opposed to displaying a show of outward force. His questions to Varys about what kind of access his "birds" had in Meereen was a good indicator of this.
Â 
I think it's an entirely consistent Tywin reaction. He isn't going to publicly treat it as a major threat but he's clearly taking steps to nip things in the bud. He just unfortunately won't be able to follow through on this because of that whole dying thing.
Â 
The show is smart in taking any opportunity to have King's Landing acknowledge Dany as a threat because it's the only way they can really tie her in to the overall narrative and not have it seem like she's starring in her own little movie somewhere else, which is what's frustrating in the books. Once everyone and their dog start converging on her in Meereen, then that issue won't really exist anymore but for now, the more the Lannisters et al mention Dany, the better.

I don't even want to call him the Hound at this point. But he had to fight the men once she went in, the fight was going to happen from the moment they saw him, and they were going to rape her. He told her not to go in, and she did. As for the roadtrip, he tried to get her home, and in the books, after the Red Wedding, she said repeatedly, he didn't care if she rode off or not, he was taking care of her and he didn't have to.
3293	Tixu Oty	2014-05-15	Lysa, Selyse and Melisandre all in one episode!!!! Not to mention Gegor Clegane. Should be a good one. And "Only Cat" is my favourite chapter in the whole series and from what we have seen there going to do it justice.

he actually said "Dragons haven't won wars in nearly 300 years, armies win wars all the time"...first part of that statment, he's referring to Aegon the conqueror ....he's not dismissing the threat of dragons entirely, if you recall a scene with jofferey in s3, he mentions how he saw the skull of the last dragon and that it was barely larger than a dogs skull, twisted and stunted growth....
Â 
he doesn't believe Dany's dragons are grown enough to pose a serious threat...however, army of Unsullied and Seconds Sons...thats a confirmed threat....thats why he didnt take any action before but decided to take some action now...

Â 
I'm thinking if they dye Sansa's hair, it will be before the Vale Lords scene. Sure it makes no sense to let her be wondering around the Eyrie as a redhead already, but I think LF will use meeting Vale Lords as a reason to hide her identity. And I doubt the Unsullied will think about the fact that she should have been hiding from the servants. But at this point I'm only giving the hair dye a 30% chance.
Â 
Brienne and Pod better be looking at hanged men. Also, does this mean we're getting Biter & Rorge this episode?
Â 
Aaand this is why I'm okay with Emilia Clarke.
3315	Le Cygne	2014-05-15	I think they will save the lovin' for when Daario gets back, maybe episode 10. Dany is going to send him off to charm someone (insert show equivalent here) and since they don't do missing people or dreams on the show, we'll just assume that's happening like in the books, I guess.

It looks like a direct continuation of this http://24.media.tumb...gfbkmo7_250.gif - some said she is touching her hands because Lysa hurt them, but perhaps LF held her hands or something while he tried to/kissed her? It really does look like she is turning to see Lysa
3317	Colonel Green	2014-05-15	Surely she is looking Â at Lysa after the...kiss


I don't think so.Â  Having her be aware that Lysa saw her would really throw off the chain of events.Â  It's possible they'll let the viewers know that she saw them, but I wouldn't expect Sansa to.

Why? She sees her, then she walks inside and Lysa unleashes the crazy on her.
3319	Le Cygne	2014-05-15	My guess - and I'm always wrong about the show, but I know the books - would be Sansa is doing some equivalent of this:
Â 

Drifting snowflakes brushed her face as light as loverâ<U+0080><U+0099>s kisses, and melted on her cheeks. At the center of the garden, beside the statue of the weeping woman that lay broken and half-buried half-buried on the ground, she turned her face up to the sky and closed her eyes. She could feel the snow on her lashes, taste it on her lips. It was the taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams.

3327	King Tommen	2014-05-15	I love that this dress is apparently Dany's "lounging around and looking at maps" outfit. It looks like she's getting ready to do a Maxim photo shoot.
Â 
Please don't take this as complaining because I am totally fine with her wearing this kind of stuff 24/7. Like, totally fine.

3329	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-15	Surely she is looking Â at Lysa after the...kiss


I think in the book, Lysa watches Sansa in the snow and Sansa notices, then a few minutes later, Sansa looks back again and Lysa's gone.
Â 
also, I'm surprised at 2 Dany scenes. The only time I've truly enjoyed her storyline this year was the premiere, where her scenes were interspersed. Don't like the few minutes and done approach. (other storylines like this are okay, b/c they're at least in Westeros..)

I do envy Dany fans. There are so many promo stills of her and she is always well lit, wearing some sexy outfit. There were 70 promo stills released for 4x06 - http://www.farfarawa...ry6/gallery.htm - being a Stannis fangirl, this is Where's Waldo? specifically made for our fanbase  It would be fun...if it wasn't so sad.

The thing about the scene is that it's so internal that following up every detail ends up with Sophie Turner just building a castle with snow (and not the type of castle some sculptor could make). What I mean is, the books can talk about snowflakes as a lover's kiss, but put on TV, that translates to "Sansa swallows a snowflake". Ditto for "It was the taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams."
So, IMHO, they'll have to get creative to convey similar feelings.
Which means they'll blow it.

3341	CaptainTheo	2014-05-15	Â 
Thanks for that, I'd forgotten how beautifully written that chapter is. *runs off to re-read*


Couldn't agree more, it's my favourite chapter, I've read it so many times and the first bit where Sansa steps into the snow always brings me to tears. Quotes like this:
Â 
"White towers and white snow and white statues, black shadows and black trees, the dark grey sky above.A pure world, Sansa thought. I do not belong here.
She could feel the snow on her lashes, taste it on her lips. It was the taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams.
When Sansa opened her eyes again, she was on her knees. She did not remember falling. It seemed to her that the sky was a lighter shade of grey. Dawn, she thought. Another day. Another new day."
3342	King Tommen	2014-05-15	I wouldn't take that Martin quote too literally. He says that line all the time when talking about the show and he's usually referencing deaths that have already taken place like Talisa, Rakharo, Mago, Irri, Xaro etc. When he says "they're still alive in Book 5" he's talking about the previously killed-off characters on the show..
Â 
Now he could be talking about a death still to come this season but just be aware that this is a go to quote that he's been using for a couple years now so it's not necessarily referencing anything new.
Â 
That being said, I personally think Thorne and Grenn are goners in E9.

Â

Â 
Agreed. We've seen multiple shots of Grenn in the tunnel when the giant smashes down the gate. Someone's not leaving that confrontation alive. Grenn's familiar enough to audiences that his death would have at least a modicum of impact (though ultimately it's likely be overshadowed by Ygritte's). There's also a minimal ripple effect because Grenn doesn't play any significant role in future books that we know of - Jon just sends him to the Shadow Tower, a place that we are unlikely to ever visit in the show.
Â 
With Grenn likely to emulate the method of Donal Noye's death, I think that Thorne will take on the other part of Noye's role. He's the acting Lord Commander in the show. If he were to survive the battle, having effectively lead a successful defense of the Wall, one would think that he would be considered the presumptive favorite for the permanent position rather than Janos Slynt or Jon Snow.Â  At the very least, it's unlikely that Stannis would be so insistent that the Night's Watch choose a new Lord Commander immediately. Whether Thorne dies fighting Tormund (as seen in the weapons featurette) or in some other manner, I think that he's gone.

3345	jarl the climber	2014-05-15	I'm a bit shocked OC is in this ep. But I guess they will make the most of it, perhaps Oberyn's offer is second to last scene and OC is the ending.


It would have been a great way to end the season but I guess they want to keep the Vale storyline moving along.

3350	StrollofShame	2014-05-15	You've convinced me. I honestly just forgot that Gregor was wounded by Oberyn at all (obviously I remember the aftermath and his poisoned wound, but not what actually happened in the fight)

Since we're listing season-resolving deaths, do you suppose, in the show, it will appear to us (& the Unsullied in particular) that the Hound is dead/near death? How about the reveal that the Mountain was poisoned? That's two more 'deaths' suggested at least, yet this season. Tho I'm iffy on the Mountain's poison reveal.

Â 
Wow. Your last line kind of choked me up a bit. *Clears throat* Anywho, IF they actually kill off The Hound (rather than spend time/money searching out a location for the Quiet Isle) I honestly think it'd be more meaningful and emotional if she gave him the gift of mercy and put a sword through his heart. I think it forever cements the 'care' that they have for each other in that he allowed HER to 'finish' him, and that she preferred to 'finish' him rather then leave him there to suffer and die.
Â 
Then again, this is all speculation, because I do agree with King Tommen (was it?) who pointed out that GRRM has been trotting out that same line about, "Killing people off who are still alive in the books," for a couple of years now. Â
3354	Le Cygne	2014-05-15	Some clues from Maisie/Rory at Comic Con indicate no worries, but at any rate, it would be terrible for Arya to do something like that, the story is, as Maisie has been saying, they come to actually sort of like each other beneath it all.

3355	Konradsmith	2014-05-15	I take it that this scene (where Sandor's in his underclothes and says "thanks to you I'm a walking bag of silver")Â is the oneÂ thatÂ Rory was supposed to be shirtless in and they decided against it last minute. After he'd worked out for months (or maybe it was just weeks)Â to prepare. I remember he told that story in an interview around when "Two Swords" premiered.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 15 May 2014 - 11:50 PM.
3356	Le Cygne	2014-05-15	Many Hound fans are quite disappointed about that one. Well, at least he finally took off his armor.
3357	Konradsmith	2014-05-15	^You in particularÂ were disappointed to hear that news..
Â 
It is funny though that Ramsay got a shirtless scene and Sandor didn't. But even showing someone in their undergarments humanizes them in a way, like Roose in "the Lion and the Rose." I kindof wish we'd got to see Olenna's hair just once for that same reason. I think the wimple was a good look but it would've been cool if inÂ one of her convos with Marge post-PW we saw her hair. As for Tywin, we'll see him good and vulnerable soon enough...

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 15 May 2014 - 11:54 PM.
3358	Le Cygne	2014-05-16	Yes, that would have been nice!Â  But I'm glad we get to see him without the armor for once.
Good point about vulnerability. All three of those examples are good ones. I didn't even realize until now we hadn't seen The QoT's hair. And Tywin, I bet he will be doing something perhaps a little less... vulnerable!
3359	Konradsmith	2014-05-16	^It's great when they strip down (literally or figuratively) very imposing people. That's why the Brienne/Jaime bath scene is so great.
Â 
Of course some of the cast/characters are imposing even when they're naked/less clothed. Carice as Mel is the best example of that. When she's naked she is in charge of the situation and every bit as intimidating as she is clothed. I've seen a lot of hate on this forum for the Gendry/Mel sex scene but I for one (and not just because I'm smitten with her) thought that it was an interesting showcase of Mel's dominance. And if you think about, if she was actually a temple prostitute from a young age (which some people have theorized) she would be that comfortable/in control whenÂ unclothed.
Â

3360	Le Cygne	2014-05-16	Yes, she seemed very comfortable, and that did get across a sense of control. Gendry was not comfortable, poor guy. I didn't like the scene at all, but the actors are always good.Jaime/Brienne scene was perfect, though.
3361	Seneti	2014-05-16	I love that this dress is apparently Dany's "lounging around and looking at maps" outfit. It looks like she's getting ready to do a Maxim photo shoot.
Â 
Please don't take this as complaining because I am totally fine with her wearing this kind of stuff 24/7. Like, totally fine.


Â 
So am IÂ   Â Now all we need is a few more attractive, shirtless (or 'pantsless')Â  men and I'm all set 
Â 
Â 
And the episode 6 recap of course. It's about bloody time that we got that one.
3362	Konradsmith	2014-05-16	I'll always defend the Mel/Gendry scene, Le Cygne. Not just for the character reasons I named above but also because it was one of the only sex scenes in the show that I found to beÂ genuinely sexy.
Â 
As forÂ theÂ expectedÂ Mel and Selyse scene, I can't wait to see that weird dynamic play out. Mel being out-zealoted is a funny idea. There may also be a very Big Love sister-wife vibe going on between the two ladies. I loved Selyse's suppressed jealousy of Mel in "the Lion and the Rose" and I'm glad to see that carry on in "Mockingbird".

Ah sorry I was thinking about flash backs (although you're right, Bran had one a few weeks ago)

Wow. Your last line kind of choked me up a bit. *Clears throat* Anywho, IF they actually kill off The Hound (rather than spend time/money searching out a location for the Quiet Isle) I honestly think it'd be more meaningful and emotional if she gave him the gift of mercy and put a sword through his heart. I think it forever cements the 'care' that they have for each other in that he allowed HER to 'finish' him, and that she preferred to 'finish' him rather then leave him there to suffer and die.
Â 
Then again, this is all speculation, because I do agree with King Tommen (was it?) who pointed out that GRRM has been trotting out that same line about, "Killing people off who are still alive in the books," for a couple of years now. Â 


Part of me thinks that Arya killing the Hound would be awesome... But I am still holding out hope that a certain gravedigger will re-enter the story at some point, so I am hoping they leave his death ambiguousÂ

3365	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-16	Since we're listing season-resolving deaths, do you suppose, in the show, it will appear to us (& the Unsullied in particular) that the Hound is dead/near death? How about the reveal that the Mountain was poisoned? That's two more 'deaths' suggested at least, yet this season. Tho I'm iffy on the Mountain's poison reveal.


Â 
I'll bet we see Oberyn applying the poison. Â This is TV.
3366	Jinjonator	2014-05-16	I feel like the interview probably isn't him talking about characters who were killed in past seasons, since he's very clearly speaking in future tense. Someone is going to die who isn't dead yet. Whether or not it's someone not-that-major and they're just playing it up... that remains to be seen. But I'm definitely looking forward to being surprised.
3367	Konradsmith	2014-05-16	^So far in the show's run GrrM has complained about pretty unimportant/easily replaceable characters being killed off inÂ show canon. I doubt it will be anyone major. The biggest alive-in-the-books death I can seeÂ happening isÂ Ser Alisser, who I'd prefer to live, but given he'll be duelling with Tormund in 409, I'd rather he go than Giantsbane.

3368	Tixu Oty	2014-05-16	What I mean is, the books can talk about snowflakes as a lover's kiss, but put on TV, that translates to "Sansa swallows a snowflake". Ditto for "It was the taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams."
So, IMHO, they'll have to get creative to convey similar feelings.
Which means they'll blow it.


Â 
I think they can do it just fine.
Â

Â 
I think the Hound isn't going to die. It's not about it being bothersome to make the Quiet Isle happen, it's about whether or not Martin kept him alive for a good reason. I tend to think that's the case, and if so, the show runners will need (and certainly want, he's awesome) The Hound alive later on. It would be nice if we actually had the Quiet Isle, but I'm sure they can also make it work in a much more simple way. What I think would really be awesome, would be to hear talk of The Hound all through next season and wondering WTF just like in the books. I really loved that part of AFFC.
So no. I don't think Arya will kill him, and I also don't think it would be good for her character development to kill him.
Â 


I'll bet we see Oberyn applying the poison. Â This is TV.


Â 
I hope we also see him seriously hinting on it when he talk to Tyrion.

^This. I don't think we will see Oberyn dipping/coating the spear before the fight, but I do think there will be a few clues slyly slipped into conversation.
Â 
I really wish we had seen more of the mountain in the series. I feel like in the book he was this big presence, mentioned in most POVs.Â 
I know there was casting issues but most unsullied wouldn't understand the fear/horror he is able to inspire.
I keep on having to remind my unsullied friends that he killed his horse in the first season.. It's the only way they remember him.
3370	Konradsmith	2014-05-16	BTW on the subject of Dany's new dress as seen in the promo pics, an Vanity Fair online article that I found over the GoT imdb page (I can't post links on AFOIAFÂ so I'm sorry, you'll all have to find it DIY) has an excerpt from a Michelle Clapton (the costume designer). She says that, as everything Dany does is now calculated, that Dany uses that new dress (as sexy as it is) in a "very cruel" way. What do we all think she means by that?
3371	Conchobar	2014-05-16	^It's great when they strip down (literally or figuratively) very imposing people. That's why the Brienne/Jaime bath scene is so great.
Â 
Of course some of the cast/characters are imposing even when they're naked/less clothed. Carice as Mel is the best example of that. When she's naked she is in charge of the situation and every bit as intimidating as she is clothed. I've seen a lot of hate on this forum for the Gendry/Mel sex scene but I for one (and not just because I'm smitten with her) thought that it was an interesting showcase of Mel's dominance. And if you think about, if she was actually a temple prostitute from a young age (which some people have theorized) she would be that comfortable/in control whenÂ unclothed.
Â 
(I say that to pre-empt the backlash against her scene next episode.)


I agree, I liked how that scene portrayed her dominance over men, Stannis included.
3372	Jinjonator	2014-05-16	Probably gives some dude a boner and he's like "ah damn, a boner. i gotta do something with this boner, wild boner out of control".
Â 
Probably.
3373	Konradsmith	2014-05-16	^Well in the promo she's not wearing that dress in her scene with Daario. It's a similar one but without the midriff/belly button cut-out. I suppose she could wear that dress around Jorah to torment him.
3374	Winter.Is.Coming	2014-05-16	I hope they don't kill of the Hound.....Rory McCann is great in the show but it will be interesting to see whether the show runners include the Quiet Isle as this may shed light on the Hounds death/survival.

I just don't see the QI making it in (though I guess it depends on if Brienne is there with the UnCat reveal). It's a lot of time to devote to something that doesn't really move her plot. But I think they could still leave his death ambiguous.
3376	~No One~	2014-05-16	^he could also have a cameo digging graves or some such that's not explicitly the QI. BriPod could pass him and/or have a convo, without knowing it's him. Maybe ask for directions or something.

3379	boojam	2014-05-16	^I hate to be the guy that always takes this thread in this direction. And I am sadly. Time and again. But I think Oona was referring to Esme Bianco.Yes that was the very last into I saw, Esme Bianco ,who had done her share in S1 and S2, made it clear no more.Can't blame her, I noticed in Season 2 that Esme Bianco , who I thought was a hired because she could act and do nudity, was kind of a third stringer. But! in S2 she proved she could act! She was good I miss her.Hope she got some better roles after that stint.There was as a report that an extra (who I guess had done nudity) quit the show when she read the script or the scene came to be done. That one is a minor point.
3380	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-16	Re. the Quiet Isle (and the Hound), it really depends on whether it will play a part later. While I'm 50/50 about Sandor returning, I'd find it strange to have this fairly mysterious place introduced and never hear of it again.
Â 
Some people are speculating that we'll have parts of Brienne's quest moved to next season, when she's heading to wherever Jaime will be on the show. I'm not sure about it, but it's a possiblity.

As Dany grows in strength with her dragons, the texture becomes more embellished and grows down the costume."Â She intended Sansa's dress to be bad:Â "Wedding days should be a joyous event for the bride, but, unfortunately, Sansa's being forced into a marriage that she doesn't want, into the Lannister family...Â  We guessed that it wouldn't be romantic or lovely and girly and pretty with dainty flowers, but a real strong message of dominance, saying that we own you now, Sansa."Â http://www.scpr.org/...-costumes-intr/

Agree.Â  There are Talisa/Jeyne, one of the Dothraki bloodriders, plus I think the guy Arya kills early this season was combined with the guy she kills in the Mercy WoW chapter.Â  I don't think he was giving anything huge away here.
Â 
Â 


^You in particularÂ were disappointed to hear that news..
Â 
It is funny though that Ramsay got a shirtless scene and Sandor didn't. But even showing someone in their undergarments humanizes them in a way, like Roose in "the Lion and the Rose." I kindof wish we'd got to see Olenna's hair just once for that same reason. I think the wimple was a good look but it would've been cool if inÂ one of her convos with Marge post-PW we saw her hair. As for Tywin, we'll see him good and vulnerable soon enough...


Â 
I thought Ramsay's shirtless scene was also to show him to be quite insane, and reminiscent of Viking berserkers, who worked themselves into a good lather, and charged into battle without armor, like Ramsay's sex scene, cuts all over his body, and charging into a swordfight un-armored and armed with only knives.Â  For him, sex was just the foreplay for violence, and the violence was something he dove into with reckless abandon.

She has been influenced by each part of her journey and adapted ideas into her style, but it has really always had to be practical. Now, we see her wardrobe widen, costumes for court and for the bedroom and for hanging out with Missandei, she is exploring new shapes, but you always get the sense that everything is calculated to send a message. The dress you mention is used in a very cruel way . . . it says more than words.http://www.vanityfai...any-cruel-dress

Also, if she's dressed to appeal to Daario and not Jorah, that's Jorah's problem, too, not Dany's.

3416	Metopheles	2014-05-16	Does it look like some kind of straw puppet on the ground when the Mountain takes his step? Maybe a mockery of the king -> reason why they are executed?
And yes, Cersei is in the back, tiny and with two Lannister guards
3417	Batbob45	2014-05-16	We get two crazy mom in the same episode. Lysa who is very protective of her son and messed up in the head.Â Â  Their is also Selyse who is a crazy fundamentalistÂ  and is very neglectful of her daughter.
3418	oursisthefury69	2014-05-16	Each time they have Jaime and Tyrion talk to one another it takes a little bit more away from what will beÂ their final scene with each other this season; just like
1. Jaime being in Kings Landing early ruined a lot of his interactions with the kingsguard/ his motivation for improving the kingsguard having witnessed Joff die,
Â 
2. Ruins his actual suspicions of Tyrion perhaps actually having killed Joff, which were very real in the books having not been at the Purple Wedding(and having just deduced that Joff sent the assassin for Bran), which will also take the umph out of him lying to Jaime and saying he really had killedÂ Joff if they even do that.
Â 
3.caused him to essentially break his vow to Catelyn by not helping Sansa while they were both in KL, which also makes Briennes whole life threatening quest for Sansa a lot more unnecessary/stupid.
Â 
4.Â  Somehow turned him into a rapist

3422	Konradsmith	2014-05-16	Dany isn't wearing the midriff-baring dress in her Daario scene in the promo, iheartseverus. As for how wearing a dress could be cruel, Le CygneÂ her having it on in front of Jorah is the only thing I can think of. Yes, she can wear whatever she wants etc. but let's not get to calling Michelle Clapton somehow sexist for saying that was cruel.
Â 
As for Jaime, tons of Unsullied find his scenes with Tyrion to be very touching/redeeming. I thinkÂ giving him Kevan's trial roleÂ was a good choice that reminds us of how strong their brotherly bond is and also puts two really good actors together in scenes. Though it would be fun to see Jaime smack around Meryn Trant or something, these scenes are serving his characterization well to my mind. Like so much else it's about Aemon's love or duty problem. As for THAT scene in "Breaker of Chains", I've defended it before but I WILL NOT do so here (on this thread or on this site) because there are other things to talk about and it has been discussed to death. I would advise that we try to not make this particular thread devolve in that direction.

I think the Jaime/Tyrion scenes this season are an improvement to what's in the book in all honesty. The fact that Jaime never sees Tyrion before he frees him rang false to me. I know he wasn't there for the wedding but he did arrive shortly thereafter, and was present for the whole trial, etc. In terms of the Kingsguard interactions, there are no name characters he could deal with other than Ser Meryn, since Loras isn't in the KG and there is no Kettleblacks (yet at least). While I did like these interactions in the book, I prefer the Tyrion/Jaime screentime.

3428	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-16	Anyone else re-read chapters before the material airs on TV? I re-read the two chapters of Tyrion's trial last Saturday to see how much the show would cover. Probably risky to do so because the show might not live up to one's expectation, e.g. I was a little bothered that Oberyn didn't get his "Well, that's a relief" line at the beginning of the trial. But that was quickly overshadowed by quality television, of course. I was wonderfully surprised because the live-action version was so engaging, but I could have just as easily been incredibly disappointed. Debating whether I should re-read Sansa VII before Sunday night.

I had a friend who wanted to watch the entire 2nd season the day before the season premier.Â  So we got a bunch of food and made a drinking game with a long set of rules like drink everytime somebody drinks wine, gets murdered, calls somebody a c*nt, every time Joffrey does something evil, etc...Â  The poor guy was out by the time Renly bought it.Â  Even I was getting confused despite having read the books and seen the show.

3445	Le Cygne	2014-05-16	Lena Headey is fabulous, what can I say.
3446	King Tommen	2014-05-16	I'm interested to see if the show is going to depict Stannis and Davos returning to Dragonstone (to "collect their forces" or something similar) or if the implication in the Davos/Saan scene is that they were going to the Wall with his fleet right from Braavos.
Â 
I'm wondering because I'm not sure what they'll be doing with Mel, Selyse and Shireen who we visit with in this episode and if they're going to find a way to link up with Stannis for his arrival at the Wall in E9.
Â 
I know in the books they mention Mel burning Orell's eagle in the midst of the battle and I now can't shake the imagery of her getting a chance to do something with her powers (alongside shots of Davos and Stannis cutting down Wildlings).Â  I think it would be a powerful sequence to show Stannis using all the power in his arsenal (including Mel) during his charge as opposed to just watching a bunch of nameless Baratheon soldiers charging through the Wildlings on horseback as we've seen in the trailers.
Â 
In show canon, Orell's eagle still exists presumably after giving Jon the business last season so maybe they'll find a way to incorporate that part.
3447	DaveyJoe	2014-05-16	They also showed a Warg Thenn with an eagle.

3449	Konradsmith	2014-05-16	^Aye. But how's that fellow going to get north of the Wall? Presumably everyone except Tormund dies in the attack from the south.

I think the Owl would be the one North of the Wall, not the warg. Isn't that the whole point of having them? So they can deliver messages back and forth to each other from both sides?

Better yet: Oberyn's voiceover while Season 1 Mountain is shown killing Ser Hugh, cutting off his horse's head and attacking the Hound.
3459	King Tommen	2014-05-16	They're definitely going to skip right over Ian Whyte's Mountain 2.0 since most show fans had no idea it was supposed to be the same guy as Conan Stevens. Thor looks like Conan (isn't it ridiculously awesome that these are the actors' names?).

Â 
Yes, that's right. Although, it doesn't necessarily confirm that she'll be there for the attack with Stannis. She could be in a separate party with Selyse and Shireen that we catch up with at CB in E10 after the fighting's all over.
Â 
I'm thinking now that they're pretty much going to have to have Stannis come back to Dragonstone first before heading to the Wall. I think the idea of Saan bringing his fleet was so that they'd have enough ships to get Stannis' full army to the Wall from Dragonstone as I think we're just supposed to believe that he and Davos sailed to Braavos on the 1 ship (although they could always fudge it).
Â 
If Mel and Selyse were along for the ride to Braavos, then I'd be more certain it was the pitstop on the way to the Wall but I think us checking in on them in Dragonstone this episode will set up their eventual departure with Stannis and co.Â  That very well could be what Selyse sees in the flames.
Â 
And if this is the case, I'm not sure if they're still going to go to the trouble of hiding their E9 arrival from the audience. They might be ready to say "yep, got my ships and money, we're ready to do that thing we talked about doing last season now."

I'm 99% sure they will keep the intentions hidden. It wouldn't make much sense to go through all of that trouble to hide Stannis' arrival at the Wall to have it spoiled 2 eps prior.
3463	iheartseverus	2014-05-16	^ I'm guessing they'll use Selyse and Mel looking into the flames as another hint that Stannis is heading to KL, something about it being 'a battle for the crown,' which leads the viewer to assume KL.Â  And then, I hope we'll later get Stannis' line about saving the kingdom to win the crown.

Â 
I was totally on board with this when it looked like Braavos was the pit stop between Dragonstone and the Wall and it looked like we wouldn't get anything after with Stannis before he showed up in E9.Â  But now that it looks like he needs to head back to Dragonstone and pick up his army and family, that probably necessitates another scene or at least an explanation as to what he'd doing next. And then you're going to have a tougher time hiding the intentions from the audience.
Â 
Maybe I'm wrong but it just looks like they're setting up this way now.

Well they can simply check in with Mel and Selyse and either don't mention Stannis' intentions at all or say something vague - 'he has an army now'. If we were actually to see Stannis then maybe, but I'm sure we won't see him in 7 and 8

Â 
Think about the timelines for a minute. Brienne could maybe encounter him next season, but definitely not Pod (unless they delay or alter the LS encounter).

Is it confirmed/is there proof that BriPod encounters LS this season? I'm seeing a lot of this speculation....is it based on anything concrete, because I am highly skeptical....

Â 
Well they had plenty of mentions of Catelyn and Lena has been dropping hints like crazy  As for them actually meeting her, it just seems like something the showrunners would do to tie two stories as fast as they can and probably in their mind making the reveal more intense.
3470	DaveyJoe	2014-05-16	It's all speculation based on the pace that Brienne's story is going.Â  It's also hard to come up with a good season ender for her.

Â 
They sent Brienne and Pod off on her quest halfway through this season and have not cast any of the people she runs into as per the books (Randyl Tarly, Septon Meribald, Dick Crabb, Shagwell, Pyg, Timeon etc).
Â 
It's not really the show's M.O. to cast and depict the prologue/epilogue 1 and done POV characters (outside of Cressen I suppose). I find it unlikely that they'd bother with having the meet come from a random Frey perspective as we don't really know any of them outside of Walder.
Â 
It seems like they're skipping the Frey meet (perhaps just showing a hanging aftermath as early as this episode) as the big reveal. It certainly seems like they'll link up the Brienne storyline to LS and the BwB. There's no way to know exactly what they're going to do because LS is shrouded in complete secrecy so it's just speculation at this point. But I think the speculation is extremely well-founded.
3472	Konradsmith	2014-05-16	Didn't Tywin already say "ourselves alone" in "First of His Name", Sati? I know what you mean though, she and Tywin will have another scene together because we have yet to hear her say "I would burn our house to the ground before I let that happen".

Sandor learns about the bounty on his head ("Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silvers!") and removes his armor (so he could be less identifiable?). Apparently, they get into a fight with bounty hunters and the Hound suffers some wounds. I assume this is the episode where Arya and the Hound learn about Joffrey's death; with news of Sandor's bounty must come news of the recent regicide.That did not look like 'mercy' to me , looked like she gigged a guy in the gut!Anyway why is he blaming Arya? After what happened at Blackwater (and it's sure taken a long time for him to be mentioned in KL again)... Sandor would have to know that there would be a price on his head. In fact Polliver and his guys should have been discussing it.After all Varys mentioned the Hound last episode while saying nary a thing about Arya.If that was known it he would have been a walking bag of gold!!I am not sure but this bounty thing about Sandor is not in the books, could be it is, if not, George sure left it out.

They sent Brienne and Pod off on her quest halfway through this season and have not cast any of the people she runs into as per the books (Randyl Tarly, Septon Meribald, Dick Crabb, Shagwell, Pyg, Timeon etc).
Â 
It's not really the show's M.O. to cast and depict the prologue/epilogue 1 and done POV characters (outside of Cressen I suppose). I find it unlikely that they'd bother with having the meet come from a random Frey perspective as we don't really know any of them outside of Walder.
Â 
It seems like they're skipping the Frey meet (perhaps just showing a hanging aftermath as early as this episode) as the big reveal. It certainly seems like they'll link up the Brienne storyline to LS and the BwB. There's no way to know exactly what they're going to do because LS is shrouded in complete secrecy so it's just speculation at this point. But I think the speculation is extremely well-founded.

Ok, yes, I do see why the speculation exists, but I wanted to know if there was leaked info or pics or something.
Thanks all for the replies. Cool beans. I resume my position of respectful skeptic. As you were.

Â 
Well, so far they've been over the portion of the story that has included just three prologue (and no epilogue) one and done characters - and two of the three have been included - Will and Cressen. They've only omitted Chett, which is no big surprise since it's the one prologue/epilogue that really wasn't that necessary and didn't reveal anything that important.
Â 
They met omit Random Frey getting hanged, but I'd hardly say that omitting Chett establishes a pattern of show's MO.
Â 
(My guess is that they'll include Pate and omit Varamyr, using an already established character, probably the Thenn warg played by Joseph Gatt, to convey the same information.)
3480	Wouter	2014-05-16	Wouldn't a meeting between LS and Brienne/Pod have to wait until it becomes clear Jaime is not keeping his oath (by waging war against the Blackfish)? Otherwise the hostility of LS and co would be harder to explain and understand.
3481	Hangover of the Morning	2014-05-16	Didn't Tywin already say "ourselves alone" in "First of His Name", Sati? I know what you mean though, she and Tywin will have another scene together because we have yet to hear her say "I would burn our house to the ground before I let that happen".


Â 
Never would have guessed that Tywin was a Sinn Fein fan, albeit a bad one since he has mistranslated the famous motto.Â

Â 


Â 
I'd agree if that involved a character that had any relevance to Brienne.Â  But Locke is dead, so it may be Roge and Biter, but Brienne never interacted with them in the show.Â  If episode 10 ends with some strangers antaganozing Brienne and she wins the fight, that's great, but her season 4 story gets no closure, because the search for Sansa hasn't gone anywhere.Â  BUT, if she meets LS, that puts a halt to her plans, and gives something of a resolution to that storyline, even if it ends on a cliffhanger.Â  Do you know what I mean?Â  Kind of rushing this post at work...
3483	Colonel Green	2014-05-16	Â Ripping off a man's ear could be a good season ended too...


Not really.Â  Brienne goes out to look for Sansa.Â  She runs into some random guys (because she has no experience with the Brave Companions in the show), and kills them.Â  She resumes her previous course.Â  Fin.
3484	Annara Snow	2014-05-16	Dany isn't wearing the midriff-baring dress in her Daario scene in the promo, iheartseverus. As for how wearing a dress could be cruel, Le CygneÂ her having it on in front of Jorah is the only thing I can think of. Yes, she can wear whatever she wants etc. but let's not get to calling Michelle Clapton somehow sexist for saying that was cruel.
Â 
As for Jaime, tons of Unsullied find his scenes with Tyrion to be very touching/redeeming. I thinkÂ giving him Kevan's trial roleÂ was a good choice that reminds us of how strong their brotherly bond is and also puts two really good actors together in scenes.


Â 
I always thought it would be a good idea, because the TV viewers don't see Jaime's and Tyrion's internal thoughts so they wouldn't know how strong their bond is.

3486	iheartseverus	2014-05-16	I'm really wondering now if they're going to issue a recap at all this week--IIRC, its always been released way earlier than this, sometimes even on Thursdays.
3487	Arkash	2014-05-16	Another point for Brienne to meet LS that early is that most of Brienne's journey through FeastÂ is irrelevant to her quest. Most of what we get there could be seen through the eyes of another character, Jaime for example : the devastation of the Riverlands (maybe even meeting Septon Meribald) and meeting Randyl Tarly are the main stuff of Brienne's journey and Jaime could accomplish them easily next season.
Â 
It saves a lot of screentime for other storylines and we will probably see Brienne again as a cliffhanger around episode 9 of season 5.
3488	Annara Snow	2014-05-16	I hope so. Every week I see these poor dedicated Dany fans recoloring her clothes red on tumblr  I'm sick of her wearing blue all the time, they really should bring a little diversity to costumes - for example with Margaery last year I was sure she had one dress and it turned out they made several which were just astonishingly similar.


Â 
Dany being almost always in the same dress is pretty silly. Poor Sansa is even worse, they just can't give her a new dress.
Â 
As for Dany wearing blue, someone on Tumblr recently pointed out that it may be because of the "blue and orange" rule so popular with contemporary cinematographers. Since Dany is in Essos, which is shot in warm, orangey colors, she is made to wear blue in order to stand out. So, if/when Dany gets to the North or the Vale or some other place that's shown in a bluish hue, we can expect her to finally start wearing red.
3489	Father of Dragons	2014-05-16	I'm pretty sure that Rorge was returning this season
3490	Konradsmith	2014-05-16	I'm sure they'll still have one in front of the episode, iheartseverus, but they might just be too lazy to release it beforehand. Or maybe we'll still get it today. Or maybe tomorrow.

Well, you guys'll get it. Not everyone is lucky enough to live in a country where they show the recap before the episode.
3495	iheartseverus	2014-05-16	^Srsly, you don't see the recap before the episode?Â  But, you can see it when we bring it here to these threads, right?
3496	Colonel Green	2014-05-16	The main thing I want to see in the recap is whether any of the Stannis material in episode 6 gets mentioned, which would give some clues as to what's happening with Mel and Selyse.
3497	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-16	That did not look like 'mercy' to me , looked like she gigged a guy in the gut!


That's why I italicized it.  I keep putting gift of mercy into all of these prediction threads because it keeps surprising me how long they're holding off on it. I assume Arya and Sandor will fight and kill some guys, and one of them will be left fatally wounded. I like it better with an RW survivor, but oh well...
Â

I don't think that's necessary. Roose's line at the wedding is enough for her to want Jaime dead. And the notion that Brienne has apparently taken up with Jaime and is serving him, forgoing her oath to Cat.
3498	King Tommen	2014-05-16	^Srsly, you don't see the recap before the episode?Â  But, you can see it when we bring it here to these threads, right?


Â 
On HBO Canada, they never have the next episode promos after and they only occasionally have the Previously On clips. They also never show the advertised pre-season trailers when they're supposed to either.Â  That's why the internet is your friend I guess.
3499	iheartseverus	2014-05-16	It's interesting that just since the last episode, a couple of the regular PTV Unsullied are slowly becoming Team Stannis.Â  They've worked through the hints that the Lannisters are going down as the ruling party, started searching around for who's next on the horizon, ready to rise.
Â 
Haha okay now I kind of want to see Tywin die just to see what a mess Cersei would make of things if she TRULY had the reins. She was in charge when Joffrey had Ned excuted, so that oughta be real interesting. Maybe that was foreshadowing when Davos suggested the possibility to the Iron Bank that none of the remaining Lannisters would be competent to rule a kingdom after Tywin dies and that it might clear the way for Stannis. Except maybe Tyrion - who, if he survives this, probably won't be given the opportunity to have real power in KL again anyway. (Not if Cersei lives).
Â 
Maybe the Lannisters really will be toppled, leaving KL ripe for Stannis to pick. And then, NORTHWARD! Gosh, did I just join Team Stannis?
Â 
Welcome aboard! Screw those other deities, Team Stannis worships The Lord of Light, a can-do god who Gets Shit Done. Oh, the occasional blood sacrifice might be required, but there is a big upside. And look at Stannis! He is a proven battle leader, in his prime, in fighting trim, with solid hooves, err, feet, clear eyes, and good teeth. Team Stan also gets Ser Davos, the faithfulest knight to ever say "kah-niggit". Plus Shireen, who seems like a pretty cool kid, and Mel, who is a pretty hot priestess.

She has more reasons to be angry with them in the show, where they were both back in KL while Sansa was there and didn't do anything to send her back. Plus she would only have learned about Sansa's forced marriage as LS on the show. That's a lot of infuriating information to process while you're already an insane vengeful zombie.

Â 
"The Lannister's send their regards" is inclusive enough for her to lay that on him by association. Even though it's not specifically Jaime, it's a family plot to slaughter her son so I don't think she's really in the mood to see how good he's been with his promises after that.

Wha? Dany probably has the one of the largest wardrobes in the show: E1: pre-bath dress, meeting Drogo dress and wedding dress. E2: Drogo banging dress. E3: Dothraki attire. E8: "scale" attire. E15: Blue Qarth dress. E16: the gold detailed attire. E17: a new leathery attire. E21: the new blue dress. E27: a new white dress. E37: a new more revealing dress.

Vanished.Jhogo seems to have appeared and is not even an unnamed extra! Vanished.Elyes Gabel , Rakharo, got a better job and left the show.Kovarro, invented blood rider played by Steven Cole just vanished! Never explained.We see members of Danys small ' khalasar' in the back ground , at times, even this season, but even in Dance we don't know where the hell they are or stay.I aways like the Dothraki 'aura' with Jhiqui and Irri , even if they didn't have much to say. Alas they had speaking parts in the show , cheaper to pay just one speaking handmaiden (tho she is more) Nathalie Emmanuel.If Jorah gets exiled next episode things get a little thin, since Daario is sent on a mission, I guess that will happen?Grey Worm doesn't have much to say.Leaving only Missandei and Selmy to talk to!Wondering if Skahaz mo Kandaq will show up? Shavepate had a modestly important role to play in Dance as new Dany loyalist.Got a lot of story in Meereen , but most of it does not translate to visual drama very well!
3510	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-16	I, too, would have liked to see at least one Meereeneese who was on the previous ruling council of Meereen before Daenerys, standing next to her in that throne room, but oh well, I guess she's brushing them all off until next season.
3511	Carne	2014-05-16	With Gwendoline Christie having a stunt double for Mockingbird I'm guessing she and Pod will run into Rorge and Biter.

However it's a good feeling on Monday mornings when I can watch the preview for the next episode to start my day.
Rorge and Biter actors both confirmed they were back. We'll see them soon enough.I remember someone saying (possibly even Konradsmith or you) that's Rorge lying on the ground with Arya. It'd make more sense for that to happen than them snowing up and fighting a woman they've never met.

That might actually make more sense. Arya and the Hound stubmling upon poor peasants being killed by Rorge, Biter and some other thugs. Rory McCann also said he had three fight scenes, no? So the Inn (episode 1), fight with Rorge and Biter (episode 7), and fight with Vale soldiers (episode 8 or 10).

Love Brienne's armor.
Nice to see the Hound slightly undressed!
Â 
Would Sansa and Lysa be about the same size? Maybe she could borrow some clothes. Otherwise, I love her in the cloak. That's a great look for her. There is always a discussion about Sansa being more Southern in outlook but I think she looks magnificent in the snow.
Â 
On topic, this episode looks action packed. I think the last four episodes are going to be amongst the best in the entire show.

How much ADWD material would you all say we've covered so far? So we're already at the consummation of her affair here.

With Brienne, if she meets LS at the end of this season, she'll be very close and the Bracken-Blackwood feud will be cut. Possibly the siege of Riverrun. Depends what they'll want to to with Brienne.
EDIT: I forgot about Theon and the Boltons (sounds like a band name). If the fArya plot is introduced, it'll be next season, but Moat Cailin will be in a few weeks, I assume. And we will be getting more Yara. In a trailer, there was a shot of her on a boat at daytime.

3537	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-16	I'm fine with naked Daario, but I was hoping to see Dany naked as well, if only for 4x07 to mirror 3x08 (by which I mean both Dany and Mel would have been naked in both episodes). It can't just be a coincidence: there is always a bathtub involved!
Â 
Anyways, glad to see Dany getting the D. It's been a while. 
	Spoiler (And by the D, I mean Daario.)

3540	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-05-16	Does anyone have the link to that nudity info website?
3541	koke	2014-05-16	I think "cruel" is just a lighthearted term from Daario's POV. Oh, she's so cute, she teases me with that sexy dress. Â He (and Jorah?) are in the map scene. Then that night, the scene we see in the preview.
Â 
That's my guess.


Â 
I've not clue about Daario but I just want to point out that Jorah definitely is in that map scene with Dany. I was watching this video and you can see both of them at 3:11Â http://youtu.be/6ottevaCcAw
Â 
I guess this could be the scene in which Jorah says his "there's good and evil on both sides of every war ever fought" line.
Â 
Btw! I recall seeing a trailer in which Jorah said something like this to Dany: "If you treat men like beast they become beast" but I can't find it anywhere... anyone knows which video it is and where I can find it?Â

I think that was from last season ("There's a beast in every man...") something along those lines. I don't think the line in the trailer was the same as the line from the show though albeit I don't remember what episode/context it was said in.
Â 
Edit: Might be wrong it's been a while since I've watched some of the trailers..

3545	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-16	"there's good and evil on both sides of every war ever fought" line."If you treat men like beast they become beast"

There's those two lines, and also (paraphrasing for all): "How can I rule seven kingdoms when I cannot control a single city?", "let the priests argue over good and evil", and "they can live in my new world or they can die in their old one." Some of these can share a scene, but we're getting lots of Dany acting too badass for her own good (remember Qarth?). Some of these lines, particularly the one about beasts and the one about living/dying, and Daario's comments about killing people, lead me to believe we're getting Sons of the Harpy already. You'd think that would be mentioned in the synopsis though.
3546	Seneti	2014-05-16	I'm interested to see if the show is going to depict Stannis and Davos returning to Dragonstone (to "collect their forces" or something similar) or if the implication in the Davos/Saan scene is that they were going to the Wall with his fleet right from Braavos.
Â 
I'm wondering because I'm not sure what they'll be doing with Mel, Selyse and Shireen who we visit with in this episode and if they're going to find a way to link up with Stannis for his arrival at the Wall in E9.
Â 
I know in the books they mention Mel burning Orell's eagle in the midst of the battle and I now can't shake the imagery of her getting a chance to do something with her powers (alongside shots of Davos and Stannis cutting down Wildlings).Â  I think it would be a powerful sequence to show Stannis using all the power in his arsenal (including Mel) during his charge as opposed to just watching a bunch of nameless Baratheon soldiers charging through the Wildlings on horseback as we've seen in the trailers.
Â 
In show canon, Orell's eagle still exists presumably after giving Jon the business last season so maybe they'll find a way to incorporate that part.


Â 
I don't think Stannis is going to return to Dragonstone. More likely he'll borrow Varys' instant-ocean-cross raven and send a letter, telling them that they can board the ships and leave. Also, I do hope we're going to get Mel burning the eagle.That was one of the most vivid examples of Fridge Horror in the entire book.
Â 


Thor looks like Conan (isn't it ridiculously awesome that these are the actors' names?).


Â 
Never noticed that. Awesome 
Â 


Not really.Â  Brienne goes out to look for Sansa.Â  She runs into some random guys (because she has no experience with the Brave Companions in the show), and kills them.Â  She resumes her previous course.Â  Fin.


Â 
Exactly. The guys she fights do not necessarily have to be people she knows. She'll have her crowning moment of awesome anyway.
Â 


Â 
Guess it would help if I threw in some Canadianese in my posts from now on, eh?


Â 
And I'll bring the maple syrup!Â

Â 
So, does that make us up here in Canada the Wildlings or the White Walkers?
Â 


Those talking about costume changes should trying being a fan of Arya. Seriously, that outfit is just going to disintegrate at some stage.


Â 
To be fair, though, Arya has a good excuse for wearing but one outfit (fugitive on the run, no money, no tailors), whereas Margaery and even Sansa should have a decent wardrobe full of gowns. Oh well...
Â 


Slightly undressed Hound, very undressed Daario, this episode is looking up.

My wife who has only read up until CoK said to me "Do you think DH is Jaqen or one of the Faceless Men?" which I thought was a pretty astute observation. I told her that (the consensus is) Jaqen is somewhere else in the Prologue to AFFC, but it's certainly possible he is a Faceless Man. I know that there's a lot in the DWD that points to Missandei possibly being more than she appears, but has there been much discussion about the possibility of Jaqen being a FM?

I love watching that purely because everything is the most challenging thing.
Also, if you pause at 2:52, just before it says "DAENERYS" you can see her (presumingly) putting her hand up to make Jorah shut up and Barristan with his hand on his sword.

Does Dany even know who Balon Greyjoy is?
Â 
I can't imagine she'd see him as a threat.
Â 
Quick question: Were there any reports last year of Patrick Malahide filming a scene for Season 3.10? If not, they may suprise us with another scene with Balon, alternatively it gives hope for LS as well

3563	Tyrion1991	2014-05-17	Surely this is the episode where Dany and Daario sleep together and not episode 10.
Â 
The promo clips have all focused on Daenerys acting or looking sexy for this episode. There will be a bit more of ruling Meereen in the background obviously but this seems to be the focus of her story this episode.Â 
Â 
Episode 10 has to include the dragons being caged (I think Jorahs exile is episode 8) and I don't see how Dany sleeping with Daario fits with the tone of "facing harsh realities" at all. Almost certain that the closing shot of Danys arc will be her leaving her dragons trapped in the catacombs under the Great Pyramid.Â 
Â 
So I think she does send him away to the Lhazareen but has sex with him before he leaves.Â 
Â 
Would be a very filler Dany clip if all they do is flirt and she sends him off to the Lhazar. So in the daytime they discuss feeding the city, perhaps the countryside slaver lords are not sending food like in the books. In the night Daario appears and asks to be sent to kill her enemies and she sends him off after sleeping with him.
Â 
I don't think Daario appears in the clip where Jorah gets exiled (IMO episode 8) and that would explain his peculiar absence from that scene (in books he is present) if Dany sends him away here.

I think this episode is where it's going to happen. If it's not here, then it's next season, as it's definitely not going to be something they do in The Children. However, I disagree that sending someone away is "filler", as it's moving the story forward and will have consequences later on. Just because something doesn't have a payoff at the exact moment that it occurs doesn't mean that it's unnecessary.Â 
Â 
Anyways, I agree with the timeline you've devised though!
3565	Mordos_Kull	2014-05-17	I imagine Dany will receive Tywin's message detailing Jorah's treachery.
Â 
She will question the loyalty of all her subordinates, and perhaps Daario will try and proves his loyalty by offering to kill anyone in her honour, and she will be like: "Sex?", and he will be like "Yes, please."

Doubtful. If that were discovered in the daytime then theres no reason why Dany would wait a night to speak with Jorah about it. That would be a problem people would expect to be addressed immediately. In the books they have the excuse that Dany needs somebody to help free Meereen so they separate the discovery from the exile. Little reason to do that in the show.
Â 
It would also lessen the impact if there is a big gap between Dany discovering that Jorah is a spy and acting on it.

Â 
Well, I've always though that she will discover it at the end of episode 8 and Â banish him in the season finale. That way they give the audiencie time to wonder what she will do about it, Will she kill him like other kings would do? Will she forgive him? She could even send him on some kind of deadly mission out of rage... maybe related with the chaining of the Dragons... I don't know, but I'm convinced Jorah's banishment is going to be in episode 10.Â

Â 
You're assuming she wouldn't talk with Jorah before summoning him before her in the throne room.
Â 
The whole throne room sequence could be a tribunal/offical sentence passing.
Â 
She can still challenge him before that scene, ask Selmy and Greyworm to place him under arrest, then having the evening to be counciled by Daario

Sansa builds a snow castle resembling Winterfell and is threatened by a jealous aunt. Littlefinger rectifies the situation with a short, sharp shove. Unknown if Littlefinger actually kisses Sansa (Aiden Gillen stated in an interview that the Littlefinger/Alayne relationship would be less creepy, more paternal.)
Â 


Â 
HahahaÂ   Â All of us saw how lord Baelish looks to Sansa in previous episodes. Petyr's glances of Sansa wasn't paternal at all. Lysa explained to Sansa who he is and what he wants. <U+00D0><U+0095>here's another interview with Aidan Gillen where he says: "What his relationship with Sansa becomes is quite interesting. I don't want to give too much away, but her character and personality is surprising, and that really excites me. Or rather, it excites Littlefinger."Â 
I guess the show try to represent the relationship between Sansa e Petyr less creepy to make it more admissible for audience. The kiss between a father and a daughter is very creepy, a kiss between uncle and nice is less creepy and more acceptabele. Â Â

It'd be less exciting than meeting LS, for sure. But they did the same to her - and to Jamie, in fact - in season 3.  Davos doesn't have an exciting end to ASOS either. Not every character needs to end with a bang...there'll be an overdose of those already! #excited

Jaime and Brienne's season 3 has an arc.Â  It climaxes at Harrenhal, when Jaime returns to rescue her, and reaches its denouement when they return to King's Landing in the finale, which is where they had been trying to get all season.
Â

That was more of a set up for one of next season's storylines than a culmination of a character arc, but I get your point that they're not afraid to end things anticlimactically for some characters.

Regardless of that, I do think she's reaching Stoneheart this season.
3577	Le Cygne	2014-05-17	She's only just started off, and she's got 2 episodes at most before that. That's reducing her entire AFFC story, for which she was a POV character, to little more than a couple of scenes. I doubt they'll cut Jaime's story the same way, so that leaves her nothing to do all season, until one scene at the very end. I haven't been able to figure out any other explanation for Gwendoline Christie's spoilers, though.Adding the ASOS way, for comparison:Â "I only drank some wine Â â<U+0080>¦ Â  you have no witness.""As it happens, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re wrong there." The singer turned to the hooded woman. â<U+0080><U+009C>Milady?â<U+0080><U+009D>The outlaws parted as she came forward, saying no word. When she lowered her hood, something tightened inside Merrettâ<U+0080><U+0099>s chest, and for a moment he could not breathe. No. No, I saw her die. She was dead for a day and night before they stripped her naked and threw her body in the river. Raymund opened her throat from ear to ear. She was dead.

What does she do next season, then? Where does her arc go? I get that they might move into Winds stuff, it just seems like there's lots of other material to work with available to them now, even if it's not as exciting as LS. They've barely scratched the surface of the hilarity that is BriPod.
Also, veering away from that for a moment, I do think that even if there's no kiss between LF and Sansa, the snow castle scene can easily be creepy enough (especially in such a visual medium as tv) for viewers to understand what he wants, and for Lysa to go crazy. I'm not holding my breath for a verbatim book scene, there :/
3588	Colonel Green	2014-05-17	What does she do next season, then?


Most likely the first few episodes are her and Stoneheart, and then she sits out most of the remainder until meeting Jaime.
3589	Seneti	2014-05-17	No, I meant the exact opposite of that.Â  Brienne running across and killing some guys she has no connection to is not a good story. There's no arc there at all.


Â 
Oh. I'm sorry. I misunderstood your post, then. I stand by my opinion though: It doesn't matter whether Brienne knows the guys she fights or not. What#s important is that 1) she gets into a fight trying to protect commoners, 2) the BwB comes to the rescue and 3) they realize she was sent by "the crown" and take her to LS. And I do think her season 4 arc will end with meeting LS.
Â 


Huisman has no problem being naked, I did a little research (someone had to).


Â 
Research, huh... Â  
just teasing of course
Â 


Â 
I guess the show try to represent the relationship between Sansa e Petyr less creepy to make it more admissible for audience. The kiss between a father and a daughter is very creepy, a kiss between uncle and nice is less creepy and more acceptabele. Â Â 


Â 
That and Alayne being his niece instead of his daughter is actually closer to the truth, now that he has married Lysa, and the closer a lie is to the truth, the easier it is to remember and stick by.

3591	King Tommen	2014-05-17	It's been redacted because of the sensitive nature of the episode spoilers it will contain.
Â 
In all honesty, it's probably an HBO intern's job to upload these to their YouTube channel and they just forgot/didn't get around to it this week. And really, I'm not sure why they even release it at this time anyways, it's supposed to be seen for the first time prior to the episode, it's not really promotional material. Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that they release it earlier online because it offers up some clues but they're under no obligation to do so.

It's not released before the episode where I'm from. I assume that might be why it's on YouTube. However, I am probably wrong and they have now just realised that, for the majority of viewers, there is no point (of which there is for the minority).

HA! Excellent.
3597	Arkash	2014-05-17	I think they're gonna break the patern this season of having Arya just one on two episodes and feature her in both 7 and 8. 8 is the most logical episode to injure (kill) the Hound : having both the Clegane brothers go down in an episode and then, ending Arya's storyline in 10 by having sail away to Braavos.
3598	Konradsmith	2014-05-17	^I'd put money on that.
3599	Arkash	2014-05-17	So, quick rundown of all we know of the storylines of Mockinbird so far :
Â 
- Eyrie : Snow Castle + Moon Door (probably another scene earlier in the episode).
- KL : Tyrion / Jaime. Tyrion / Oberyn. Mountain and Cersei. Maybe some Tywin and Bronn in there as well.
- Brienne / Pod : no clues over there.Â 
- Dragonstone : Mel and Selyse sharing a vision. Maybe some Shireen in there.
- Wall : Jon tries to reinforce CB and we know Sam will appear there as well. Looking forward to great scenes there. I missed the Wall in episode 6 (although it was good to have a Stark-less episode).
- Arya / Hound : she stabs someone ("Nothing" speech ?), he removes his armor (?)
- Meereen : Dany / Daario. Probably another scene earlier in the episode of Dany's small council.
Â 
This is going to be a very heavy episode. I hope they can give justice to all those storylines !

Honestly as long as they do Only Cat justice and have 'not as your judge - as your champion' it's enough to make it great
3601	Konradsmith	2014-05-17	And despite it's being such a packed episode, ArkashÂ it's another really short episode.

3603	Konradsmith	2014-05-17	^Which really means 51 minutes.
Â 
I guess the only individual scenes that have to be longer than four or five minutes are theÂ Eyrie and the Arya and the Hound stuff.

3604	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-17	Here's to hoping the pacing in this packed, short episode is stellar. I felt it was in Breaker of Chains, but First of His Name not so much.
3605	Ser Blake	2014-05-17	I'm honestly slightly worried about how they are going to handle the pacing in this episode.Â  There are a lot of characters set to appear in this episode and we already know a significant portion of time will have to be devoted to Kings Landing and the Eyrie
3606	Arkash	2014-05-17	And Arya since she has two scenes (two different backgrounds and motives in the trailer). But the Brienne / Pod stuff cannot be just some random fighting so it has to be about something.Â 
Dany's screentime will most likely consist of two scenes as well.
Â 
Brienne / Pod, Wall and Dragonstone are the only "one scene" storylines for the episode, imo.
3607	SM4e	2014-05-17	Any guesses when we will get Cersei saying "I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen"?
I'd assume it's the final scene of Cersei in episode 10 when Tywin marries Tommen to Margaery (this needs to happen before his death, Cersei would never agree to it if it wasn't for her father).
Â 
Also: There're still several lines of Jorah advising Daenerys missing. Has to be in this episode in my opinion because I assume Tywin's letter to arrive in episode 8.

No, Tommen got married after Tywin's death in the books.
3609	ebevan91	2014-05-17	I doubt it'll happen in episode 7, and we know it won't happen in episode 9. I'm guessing episode 8 or maybe early in the season finale.
Â 
Episode 8 seems most likely.
3610	SM4e	2014-05-17	No, Tommen got married after Tywin's death in the books.


Like really? I really thought it had happened before, especially after reading Cersei's PoV and her relationship to Margaery. 
Still, I think in the show it will happen/be about to happen in episode 10; it gives some hints about Cersei's season 5 arc (burning the Tower of the Hand to the ground) and shows how Tywin was controlling everything. His death will have a bigger impact then.

I know, it's odd that Cersei didn't try to call it off. Well, I guess to keep the Tyrells on their side. She's not stupid, just...a tiny bit unhinged.

If you read her pov, then you should know it happened a few days after Tywin's death. We saw the wedding from her perspective and how she reacted when Tommen coughed. It also introduced Taena and others.
But it had to be that Tywin was the force behind it. She would not have allowed it. Though what is done is done. He was betrothed and all. The wedding was only formality.

No idea about Cersei.
Â 
As for Jorah's lines, Dany @ 0:28 in Trailer #1 has the same shoulderpads of her new sexy dress, so counting on that one popping up this episode. In fact, it makes sense to have this line in the episode following Hizdahr's plea.
Â 
edit: 0:34, that is definitely not her regular blue dress, you can see a tiny fraction of her bare arm.

Since the attack on Mole's Town is in episode 8, does anyone think we will see the wildlings next episode, just to remind us that Tormund and Ygritte are still doing some raids south of the Wall? I mean both Rose Leslie andÂ Kristofer Hivju are part of the main cast, yet they were only in 2 episodes so far?
3619	Konradsmith	2014-05-17	^No, I think they'll just return for episode eight but that they'll have enough screentime to make them feel important again. And in episode nine they'll have even more.
3620	Father of Dragons	2014-05-17	^ Yep, you're right, my bad. Dont think at all we will see it this season, then.
They should make it episode 2 next year, so the Unsullied get flashbacks and think "NO DON'T KILL TOMMEN TOO". Hopefully the idea will be reinforced with Hizdahr and Dany: "IF YOU KILL HER AND HER DRAGONS I'LL STOP WATCHING".
I guarantee there's someone out there who thinks that.
3621	Metopheles	2014-05-17	I wonder if we will get Meereenese povs. Similar like we had it so far with the KL guys without Tyrion or Sansa being present, or the numerous Varys and LF scenes that we could never have gotten in the books.

Â 
Green Grace as the new Olenna 
In most cases, you need to be in the starring cast to have a scene without a book POV character
(eg, Margaery/Olenna, Varys/Baelish, Bronn/Pod/Meryn)
However, I did say in most cases, not all.
(eg, Second Sons, Roose/Walder, Yara/Balon)

Â 
Green Grace as the new Olenna 


It may help to "humanize" Meereen, one of the biggest problem with the books, is that Slaver's Bay feels to cartoonish and one-dimensional. Not sure if the Green Grace will work, but some Hizdahr/Daario next season should be fun, and maybe some Hizdahr/shavepate/Barristan too, show Selmy as an important character before Dany fleed will be greatÂ

well maybe this year. But next year Joel Fry will definitely become starring[Hizdahr] and maybe the Shavepate and Barristan get scenes together and then maybe we get some mirror like scenes with the Green Grace and her ladies, similar to Olenna in her constant tea parties in the Keep's Gardens.

I see your point, but Slaver's Bay is not that cartoonish. I would argue that it is the exact opposite. I think that most westerosi sidecharacters are extremely cartoonish. Sometimes for good[Tormund], sometimes not.
Anyway other discussion 
Â 
Oh and yes, all for Brazen Beast scenes with Barristan, Grey Worm and Shavepate training them or something!!

3629	Tyrion1991	2014-05-17	I am pretty certain that Hidzhar will assume the roles of Galera and a few of the other Ghiscari characters. Danys menagerie of supporting characters is excessive enough as it is. Even before you consider all of the people who will be joining her (Tyrion, Victarion, Moqorro). They have very little place for one note Ghiscari characters that have not done anything significant in the novels. For instance the Green Grace represents the passive aggressive attitude of the slavers. No reason Hidzhar cannot do that. Shakaz? Well, cutting him actually adds weight to Barristans decision has weight and agency. Unless something MAJOR happens as a result of Shakaz actions like he betrays Barristan during the sally then he will get cut.

Â 
That's like saying Littlefinger should be cut from the King's Landing storyline and Mace should take Olenna's place, and the storyline would be just the case.
Â 

Â 
Shakaz? Well, cutting him actually adds weight to Barristans decision has weight and agency. Unless something MAJOR happens as a result of Shakaz actions like he betrays Barristan during the sally then he will get cut.

Â 
Or unless Shakaz actually poisoned the locusts to frame Hizdahr and played Barristan like a fiddle, which is one of the theories.
Â 
If he didn't... it's still a possibility that provides a sense of mystery and makes the storyline more interesting. Even if Green Grace is not the Harpy (which I think she is) it would be really stupid to just make Hizdahr the only prominent Ghiscari character and make it 100% obvious that he's a bad guy. How boring is that? How much cooler is it if the Harpy is the apparently nice elderly woman who dupes both Dany and Barristan into trusting her, in large part because they are not used to thinking of respected elderly ladies as powerful schemers and antagonists (and they should)?

are you crazy? :'D
How can you cut all the characters that were awesome and interesting? No way they should or could cut the harpy[green grace] or Dany's only openly loyal meereenese supporter[skahaz]. They could cut Reznak and most of Quentyns party and story, but not the interesting characters of Meereen.
3632	Annara Snow	2014-05-17	Honestly as long as they do Only Cat justice and have 'not as your judge - as your champion' it's enough to make it great 


Â 
I have a hunch that "Only Cat" will be the only real big moment of the episode*, and everything else will be just setup for episode 8, 9 or 10. There are just too many storylines in this episode to give proper attention to most of them.

I think we'll be able to glean what will actually happen in that storyline based on what happens this episode. There will be some sort of fight (Gwendoline has a stunt double credited on imdb) and potentially the ear-biting that she was so amused by in the Foreshadowing.
Â 
The Hound and Arya stuff looks like it will be pretty cool too. But yes, set-up in a way. The Gift of Mercy to the dying fellow sets up the more important Gift that I think will be in episode eight.

About Brienne and Pod coming across hanged Freys, this could really work to a first confrontation with Rorge and Biter and later on by the Brotherhood. It can dealt with two episodes and some nice shortcuts could be made.

I guess they could get out of it by having Jamie or Oberyn tell Tyrion that Bronn said no.
Â 
But with the emphasis the show has put on the Tyrion/Bronn relationship, and so many unsullied expecting Bronn to step up or wondering what the hell his role was in Shae not leaving on a boat for Essos, they HAVE to have Bronn in this episode

You would think so, but unfortunately we didn't see any of it in any of the trailers or production videos. And damn near every scene is spoiled in the promotional material if you look closely enough. Add that to the fact that apparently Bronn can't visit him and I think you can appreciate the doubt some have.
Â 
I'm always being pessimistic though. Either helps me be more accepting of omissions or pleasantly surprises me. Win win.

3643	Rouge	2014-05-17	Too bad they'll probably pass on "If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
Â 
I don't know if we'll have a Bronn scene tomorrow night but, as always, I'm crossing my fingers! I do have a feeling that Bronn will convince Jaime to free his brother because of the Tysha thing, but tomorrow is probably the last time we can possibly have Tyrion and Bronn together. Sad.
3644	iheartseverus	2014-05-17	^Â  Speaking of sad, let us cherish whatever Oberyn we see tomorrow night.Â  One of the best characters GRRM ever created, and then, bang, gone.Â  One grieves....
3645	Le Cygne	2014-05-17	I hope there's no scene with Bronn telling Jaime to free Tyrion, that would be awful.Â  Jaime freed Tyrion on his own, enough with Bronn making Jaime be a better man.Â  That's laughable.

Curious, why do you think there would be such a take?
3647	Le Cygne	2014-05-17	I was responding to what the person said above ("I do have a feeling that Bronn will convince Jaime to free his brother"). I hope there isn't.

Ah, got it.Â  Agree, that would be just awful.
3649	franko99	2014-05-17	I think Bronn will have his chat with Tyrion, not only he need to refuse to be his champion , he also need to explain wtf happened to Shae. Besides this is the last Tyrion/Bronn scene, and D&D love those 2, there's no way they cut it
3650	Le Cygne	2014-05-17	There's also the scene where Bronn chides Jaime about Tyrion, when they were practicing. That's what I meant by enough.But they do need to have a scene to discuss the other things. They sort of set up that Bronn would turn him down in season 3, and yet in the scene with Jaime, Bronn was almost sentimental about Tyrion, and then gave Pod his gift. Now he's going to go from good buddy to you're on your own?

Well, but... the opponent IS the Mountain.Â  The show wants to set up that anyone opposing Gregor in a one on one is just... absurd.Â  You lose, period.Â  And Bronn is pragmatic, after all.Â  I think it works in that it hypes the Oberyn vs. Mountain set-up.Â  Everybody on the planet rooting for Oberyn and actually seeing him win.Â  And then.Â  Not.Â  Heartbreaking.Â  GRRM is a hope-crusher.
3652	OnlyOne	2014-05-17	That would break my heart.Â  For both Arya and Sandor.Â  It would make her an ice machine with no soul left, and would deny him the peace of the Quiet Isle, the only peace he will ever have known.Â 

I sincerely hope she kills the hound. Starks better start killing sometime. But of course my wishing, and hoping, and thinking, and praying mean nothing.

Â 
Yeah for me it's emotionally breaking down Tyrion to the point where everyone thinks/knows he's going to win and it pretty much happens but then it's wrenched away.
Â 
Bronn leaving Tyrion is a huge part of that.
3654	Talbot	2014-05-17	On another note, how different is the cast going to look next season?
Â 
Tywin, Ygritte, Shae, Oberyn, The Hound, Varys (kinda), and Bronn (kinda) will all be leaving in some shape or another.
3655	Le Cygne	2014-05-18	Bronn in the books:Â  "I sell my sword, I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t give it away. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not your bloody brother."
3656	OnlyOne	2014-05-18	A very cruel dress!  What an odd thing to say.  One would have thought she could dress however she likes.

Every fashion designer and/or costumer always has some 'incredibly deep and emotionally charged' nonsense to say about clothing. Pfft.
3657	OnlyOne	2014-05-18	I hope there's no scene with Bronn telling Jaime to free Tyrion, that would be awful.Â  Jaime freed Tyrion on his own, enough with Bronn making Jaime be a better man.Â  That's laughable.

I don't think they'll screw with much of the rest of Tyrion's arc for the rest of the season

Well for what its worth, I think one of the brighter spots of this season is them not forcing each arc into an episode. They can get away with spacing the characters out.
Â 
Sansa can appear in 4-5 episodes next season and not have much damage done to her story. Brienne too, if it's 2-3.

Â 
If he continue to replace Ser Illyn, and join Jaime on the Riverlands, he won't be leaving
Â 


Bronn in the books:Â  "I sell my sword, I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t give it away. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not your bloody brother."


Bronn in the showÂ "I'm aÂ sellsword, I sell my sword. I don't lend it out to friends as a favor."Â
3662	Le Cygne	2014-05-18	Yes, they set Bronn up in season 3 as noted, but they characterized him a bit differently this season (he was carrying water for Tyrion).Not fighting the Mountain is one thing, you're on your own is another.Also, this was good: "Bronn smiled like a wolf contemplating a lost lamb." I wonder if they will have him marry someone (I guess not Lollys).

3663	Talbot	2014-05-18	Well it looks like we will have 3 scenes with Tyrion in his cell: Jaime, Bronn and Oberyn.
Â 
For what it's worth, I've really liked Jaime/Tyrion this season. Welcome change from the book.

3665	Colonel Green	2014-05-18	Sansa can appear in 4-5 episodes next season and not have much damage done to her story.


Assuming they do use up her first two AFFC chapters, her remaining one is good for two episodes at most, and there's no arc there to speak of, so they'd need at least one TWOW chapter, possibly more, depending on content.Â  Or else they contrive some kind of filler, but I'm really not sure what possibilities there are there.

I'm not sure, you're the expert on the characters. I was unaware they cut material.
Â 
Fact is, Brienne & Sansa at this moment in time don't demand much screentime to progress their arcs. I think those 2 storylines will be handled just fine moving along.

Well, we have no Nestor Royce but we do have both the Bronze Yohn and Anya Waynwood. So, LF will have to deal with two of the Lords Declarant with regards to Lysa's death. Whether this follows the Nestor Royce approach, it becomes the LD's issue, something in between or maybe something different remains to be seen. We know we have "Only Cat" this episode, and that's likely the end. We also get LF in 4x08 so something happens there, and we have to have Sansa in 4x10.
Given how little actually happens in her AFFC after the immediate aftermath of Lysa's death, they'll finish her entire AFFC arc early next season, if they don't burn it this very season.
3668	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-18	On another note, how different is the cast going to look next season?
Â 
Tywin, Ygritte, Shae, Oberyn, The Hound, Varys (kinda), and Bronn (kinda) will all be leaving in some shape or another.


Bronn may still be around. I expect him to accompany Jaime to Riverrun. Varys as well. He can probably acquaint Tyrion with Illyrio in Pentos, and then surprise the audience with his King's Landing homicide(s) at the end of the season. The rest don't make a big enough presence for the show to feel any different, IMO, besides Hound and Tywin. Mostly Tywin. His presence will be sorely missed.
3669	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-18	Yeah, Ygritte's got zero presence this season.
3670	Le Cygne	2014-05-18	Sam and Gilly got lost a bit, too. Gilly last seen at a house of ill repute straight out of a Dickens tale.
3671	Tixu Oty	2014-05-18	On Dany's retinue for next season, I do think it's sad her Dothraki followers are pretty much out of the picture. My unsullied sis asked me why those weren't around anymore, were they all dead or what? I told her, yes, a few of them are supposed to still be around, except a large part of the characters that had been cast have been killed off in the show and the rest must obviously not be important enough, but yes, in theory, she still has a few Dothraki with her. She thought that was a bit confusing.
So yes, I'm pretty sure those will stay gone next season, but now that I've seen what they've done with Hizdahr (awesome!) I'm confident the Mereenese will be much more relatable in the show that they were in the books.


It may help to "humanize" Meereen, one of the biggest problem with the books, is that Slaver's Bay feels to cartoonish and one-dimensional. Not sure if the Green Grace will work, but some Hizdahr/Daario next season should be fun, and maybe some Hizdahr/shavepate/Barristan too, show Selmy as an important character before Dany fleed will be greatÂ 


Yep, I'm sure they work something nice out and Barristan should gradually step up throughout the season.
Â 


Oh and yes, all for Brazen Beast scenes with Barristan, Grey Worm and Shavepate training them or something!! 


Oh wow yes that would be awesome!
Â 


I am pretty certain that Hidzhar will assume the roles of Galera and a few of the other Ghiscari characters. Danys menagerie of supporting characters is excessive enough as it is. Even before you consider all of the people who will be joining her (Tyrion, Victarion, Moqorro). They have very little place for one note Ghiscari characters that have not done anything significant in the novels. For instance the Green Grace represents the passive aggressive attitude of the slavers. No reason Hidzhar cannot do that. Shakaz? Well, cutting him actually adds weight to Barristans decision has weight and agency. Unless something MAJOR happens as a result of Shakaz actions like he betrays Barristan during the sally then he will get cut.


I agree with the other posters that we should get most Mereenese characters next season.
For one, King's Landing will cease to be at the center of all storylines which should leave much room for the other locations. Also, Dany is in Mereen for quite a bit, it will get very boring if we can't relate to the players there and what's really going on.
Also, someone pointed out that the Sons of the Harpy mystery should be pretty important and that needs to be set-up and played out like a whodunnit kind of thing. We need to know the characters well for that to work out well.
And last but not least, the battle of Mereen will probably happen either at the end of season 5 or the beginning of season 6. It will take time and quite a bit of exposition for us to fully get the politics of not only Slaver's Bay but a large part of Essos too. It will help if we can see the slaver issue through the perspective of different characters.
Â 
Â 
Now regarding Brienne's quest:


I know I'm extrapolating quite a bit from the BriPod promo pic, but I think hope we'll see several instances of them coming upon hanged Freys, lots of hanged Freys here and there through the woods.Â  I'd love it if the show does not have BriPod actually identify who all these hanged men are, because it would, I believe, give a thrill to the worldwide viewing audience to figure it out on their own, which they will of course--all the show has to do is put those stupid Frey hats on the hanged men.Â  Then, the unsullied viewers can be all:Â  'Wait a minute!Â  Those are those Frey assholes!Â  The ones who killed all the Starks at that miserable wedding!Â  YAY!!!Â  This is revenge for the Red Wedding...Â  The North Remembers!!Â  But, who's doing it????'Â  The show can really play it for all the 'YAY!Â  Revenge!' thrills, plus all the '...but who's doing it?Â  Who's left to revenge the Starks??'Â 
Â 
Makes the unCat reveal a real punch, I think.Â 
Â 
I hope this is how it plays out.Â  It is known.


I like that idea very much!!! Doom, mystery and revenge!

I just tell them that before Drogo died, the Khalessar was about 50,000 strong and after he died it was about 50 people and some of them were the former slaves of the Lamb Men. More died in Quath. Since then she picked up 10,000 Unsullied + 2nd Sons and at least 50,000 Yunkai slaves so the 30 odd Dothraki are just insignificant.
Â 
I use that same argument to explain why she doesn't have a claim to the title Kahleesi at the moment either.

She can use the title as general title for being the leader of her caravan, her khalasar, consisting of freed Unsullied and other freed slaves, who follow her like she is a khal, not really a queen.
I see that she not really has a claim at the moment over the Dothraki still in the Grass Sea, but that will come in time.

Although they've already established that ShowBronn is unblinking in the face of the Hound - to have him simply fill his strides and run at the idea of facing the Mountain would be a little feeble.

The whole point is to build up the Mountain as this really terrifying dude and make it look like Tyrion is in a desperate situation. And Brown is a sellsword,  not a self sacrificing martyr.
Why do you think Tyrion is so despondent and saying "If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place"? Because people are just begging for a chance to fight for him?
3679	Tyrion1991	2014-05-18	are you crazy? :'D
How can you cut all the characters that were awesome and interesting? No way they should or could cut the harpy[green grace] or Dany's only openly loyal meereenese supporter[skahaz]. They could cut Reznak and most of Quentyns party and story, but not the interesting characters of Meereen.

Thats six characters already in Danys arc. Some people have mentioned that they will get more time from the lack of focus on the Kings Landing arc. Firstly, there is no decline in focus on Kings Landing (nor is there is the books for that matter). The show has been going on about Tommen, Cersei, Margery and the Tyrells since season 3; they aren't going to gloss that over. Also, the separation of Jamie and Tyrion actually takes more time since they can no longer share scenes.
Â 
Again, character overload is a major problem on this show. Its not logical that losing Jorah equates to adding two additional characters whose role in the story has only been speculated and could easily be changed by D&D. Putting eight characters in Danys arc would be straining the plot too much. They do not have time. It will require a herculean effort to put the Dornish and Ironborn arcs in the story as it is.
Â 
In season 5 with Danys arc they have to address-
Â 
Her relationship with Daario
Her marriage to Hidzhar
Quentyn
The Pit (ep7)
her exile into the Dothraki Sea (ep8)
The Battle of Meereen (ep9)Â 
Her return and meeting the other characters (ep10)
Â 
Bear in mind also that Dany usually misses out one episode of the season as well and this leaves her arc with 7 episodes. There simply isn't the time. D&D are obviously going to take huge changes to Danys ADWD arc and simplify it. They're already doing her ruling Meereen, introducing Hidzhar and flirting with Daario to set the groundwork for this. Galera and Shakaz would have been introduced this season if there role was genuinely that crucial in the grander scheme of things. Â

Her marriage to Hidzhar
Quentyn
The Pit
The Battle of Meereen (ep9) and her exile into the Dothraki Sea
Her return and meeting the other characters (ep10)
Â 
Bear in mind also that Dany usually misses out one episode of the season as well and this leaves her arc with 7 episodes. There simply isn't the time. D&D are obviously going to take huge changes to Danys ADWD arc and simplify it. They're already doing her ruling Meereen, introducing Hidzhar and flirting with Daario to set the groundwork for this. Galera and Shakaz would have been introduced this season if there role was genuinely that crucial in the grander scheme of things. Â 


I thank all the gods, fate, destiny and whatever, that you are not in the position to decide which characters should get cut. No offense, but you have no idea which characters have importance. You cannot cut the two characters that make the events happen.
3684	Zoe_H	2014-05-18	That's an awful idea.
The whole point is to build up the Mountain as this really terrifying dude and make it look like Tyrion is in a desperate situation. And Brown is a sellsword, not a self sacrificing martyr.
Why do you think Tyrion is so despondent and saying "If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place"? Because people are just begging for a chance to fight for him?


Well, no, I'm not suggesting that the streets of KL are crammed with people lining up to die for Tyrion - Bronn, Jaime and Oberon seem to be the only people left in town that don't hate him.
Â 
I'm saying that if Bronn looks Gregor up and down and simply says "Nope, not fighting that", then that will be poor narrative. Regardless of how much you want to hype up the threat, let's not do it at the expense of established character.

Â 
What events? You don't know that Shakaz will betray Barristan or that the Green Grace leads the Harpy. Nor is giving a face to those characters really neccesary. You're saying they cannot be cut on the presumption that they are far too important to the plot. So you have no idea which characters are important.
Â 
What I know, is that Danys arc is stretched enough as it is. We get a couple of minutes every episode. Those sort of numbers do not "add up to a happy ending" if they add 2 additional characters to Danys arc. Lets look at who needs to be added next season...
Â 
Victarion
Euron
Doran
Arriane
Sandsnakes
Quentyn
Aegon
Griff
Val
Â 
There is simply no place for additional Ghiscari characters. Thats a massive expansion to the cast up there and Dany has a lot of material to cover in season 5. Introducing additional ghiscari characters would fail. Its not reasonable to expect their inclusion. Even if they were they would be little better than glorified extras. Danys current companions are also massively under developed.They will need their own time as well.

I think the Green Grace and the Shavepate are both necessary, assuming the first is the Harpy and the second the poisoner. The Meereen arc is boring enough (to most people, not me though) without cutting these characters. Showing behind the scenes stuff (like Hizdahr meeting with the Green Grace and them plotting the marriage with the Harpy reveal) would add another level to Meereen that is non-existent in the books with the strict POV system.
And that's assuming the season ends with the fighting pits, which may not be the case. If they decide to fit the battle of Meereen into season 5 (which is entirely possible, though would really hurt Tyrion and Victarion/Euron), there'd be no time for these characters in season 5. At this point, I think it'll be better to get the Battle of Winterfell into season 5 rather than Meereen, but I definitely understand the desire to get Dany and her company out of there and headed for Westeros before season 6.
3687	Tixu Oty	2014-05-18	In season 5 with Danys arc they have to address-
Â 
Her relationship with Daario
Her marriage to Hidzhar
Quentyn
The Pit (ep7)
her exile into the Dothraki Sea (ep8)
The Battle of Meereen (ep9)Â

1/ You're forgetting the Sons of the Harpy. It's crucial since it's the reason why Dany marries at all. The wedding idea can't come out of the blue, even if we're talking about Dany here, it's gotta be somewhat understandable. It also presumably comes into play later at the pit and shrimps.
Â 
2/ This breakdown is speculative at this point. Personally I'd say that it would be rushed. I'd be happy to end season 5 at the pit. If we're to go any further than that, then I'd say the Battle of Mereen could be included, provided Dany plays no part in it and we can skip her almost entirely after the pit.

They WILL do the Battle of Meereen at the end of season 5. Its not even up for discussion. 2 seasons of Meereen is an incredibly generous concession to GRRM but they will not have Dany still in Meereen at the end of the penultimate season (6). They have only done big battles in episode 9 and they can't do the "Wall" treatment on this battle. GRRM has already set this to be the biggest and most complex battle in the series to date.Â 
Â 
Showing behind the scenes stuff? Pray tell where the show has the time for that? D&D were quoted as saying that this is the season that gives them nightmares. Character overload. They already need to introduce too many characters and their focus has been pushing Danys story forward.Â

Â 
The Sons of the Harpy do not need a face or characters. Show Dany responding to the threat by marrying Hidzhar and have Barristans suspicion. Also, the Sons have yet to do anything important. They have killed a handful of Unsullied and Brazen Beasts. Kind of pales in comparison to the hundred thousand strong slaver army and fleet outside the city.Â 
Â 
See above post. If they delay the Battle of Meereen into season 6 they have to do it at episode 9 and that leaves Dany still in Meereen at the end of the penultimate season. They WILL NOT do that. D&D know her WoW material and what she does when she gets back to Westeros. I am extremely doubtful that the material of two books with Dany could be compressed into one TV season.

They'd have to put a battle early in season 6 anyway. The only question is Winterfell or Meereen. Like you say, season 5 is complex- and it will be complex enough without rushing through Dany's story. Rushing through Dany means rushing through Tyrion, who has a lot of ground to cover (from Pentos to introducing the Griffs to the Aegon reveal at the Sorrows to getting captured by Jorah to becoming a slave and only then reaching Meereen). Tyrion material would suffocate season 5 and suck away screentime from all the other important storylines if the battle is to happen in episode 9, and this makes the season even more complex.
There is no good way to adapt this upcoming season (in comparison with the books, at least). You just have to decide which plotlines and characters you want to butcher and run with it. In my opinion, letting Dany fall into the background of season 5 and delaying the big battle to an early season 6 episode will do wonders for the rest of the story. And it's not that there wouldn't be a big battle that season- there'll be Winterfell- or a good and anticipation inducing climax for Dany- the pit is an awesome scene.
Not saying that this will happen, though. It seems like we're getting Dorne but the Iron Iskands might get entirely cut in favor of fitting both Meereen and Winterfell into season 5's episode 9.
3692	jentario	2014-05-18	Recap anyone indeed. Mayhaps there are some implied spoilers in it (or just things HBO doesn't want people thinking of for too long)?

Yep. I think they made a huge mistake with the recap for the episode with the Jon Arryn reveal. Showing it basically in the recap..
Perhaps this episode we will see the Brotherhood rescuing Brienne from someone and that should be a big twist, so if they would show them in the recap would spoil it. I don't know. I go with the lazy HBO employee.

Â

Â 
These are precisely the sort of characters that need to be cut if they want to tell the story. Obviously Aegon and Quentyn will be included. But they are MUCH more important than Shakaz and the Green Grace; by several orders of magnitude in fact.Â 
Â

Â 
Meereen is the big budget battle. You have dragons, ships, potentially dothraki and the CGI city all with multiple POV characters present. Winterfell is a bunch of guys in a snowstorm at the end of the day and can be very small scale. Also, it would be repetitive to have 2 big end of season battles with Stannis n co.
Â 
They are not going to do what GRRM did. The big budget battle will not happen in early season 6. The show has followed a consistent pattern of building up to a climax in episode 9. Its not reasonable to assume that they will suddenly change that. Can't understand the desire for the show to repeat the same mistake GRRM did. This is precisely why the show has spent much of season 4 on ADWD material for Dany.Â 
Â 
Tyrions story will be compacted as well. I think a lot of people are refusing to accept the limitations of the TV show to telling this story as it is written in the books. A lot of people DID say that the series was un-filmable before HBO took on the project and D&D have went so far as to say that season 5 has given them "nightmares". Cuts are to be expected.
3695	Tixu Oty	2014-05-18	What I know, is that Danys arc is stretched enough as it is. We get a couple of minutes every episode. Those sort of numbers do not "add up to a happy ending" if they add 2 additional characters to Danys arc. Lets look at who needs to be added next season...

There is simply no place for additional Ghiscari characters.


Â 
We all know there are way too many characters in AFFC/ADWD for them to be all cast in season 5. But with that argument alone, you can come up with any name and say they can'tÂ  be in cause there's too many people already. So it's all about who will turn out to be essential to the rest of the story and who will make for good storytelling. I don't know if the Mereenese characters are essential to the rest of the story yet, but I do think they'd make for entertaining characters.
Â 
Also, it seems to me that the reason why Dany's arc seems so stretched out is because they're really stalling. I was surprised her Mereneese council wasn't cast this season. So either you're right and they won't be cast at all, or they're saving it for later (Hello Jojen, Meera, Ramsay and the Tully family). They chose a very limited arc for Dany this season, and while I think they do need to pick up the pace, I don't think they're intend to rush through the rest of it so much next season. That would be a very strange constrast in my opinion.
Â 


They WILL do the Battle of Meereen at the end of season 5. Its not even up for discussion. 2 seasons of Meereen is an incredibly generous concession to GRRM but they will not have Dany still in Meereen at the end of the penultimate season (6). They have only done big battles in episode 9 and they can't do the "Wall" treatment on this battle. GRRM has already set this to be the biggest and most complex battle in the series to date.Â 


Â 
I get that it would be nice to not have Dany spend too much time in Mereen, I do. And let's face it, her whole story since the beginning of season two is leading up to the battle of Mereen. They stalled a lot of it for locigal reasons but it's still the biggest momentum of her story. It needs appropriate attention. As boring as Mereen seemed on first read, I now realize it's very dense and probably important material. Besides, it's not right to sacrifice the story just because we all want Dany to get the hell out of there already. So yes, I get your point, but I think it's not good enough a reason.
Â 


The Sons of the Harpy do not need a face or characters. Show Dany responding to the threat by marrying Hidzhar and have Barristans suspicion. Also, the Sons have yet to do anything important. They have killed a handful of Unsullied and Brazen Beasts. Kind of pales in comparison to the hundred thousand strong slaver army and fleet outside the city.Â

Â 
Suspicions about who? That's the point! Just about Hizdahr? You could be right but I think It'd be kind of boring. In this case, the only characters that would matter in Dany's story would be Barristan and Hizdahr. I'm leaving Daario aside because he's pretty much just there as Dany's fuckbuddy at this point. Nice, but brings nothing to the plot.
And the importance of the Sons of the Harpy IS NOT how much damage they can cause, but how they impact Dany's decisions. You'd expect her to give up, yet she doesn't, even though the situation is getting worse and worse everyday. She marries Hizdarh because of them! I don't think that's as unimportant as you make it out to be. And I think the conjunction of internal (SoH) and external problems (siege) make for a great story. I'm sure it'll play out better on TV than it did in the books.
Â 


They'd have to put a battle early in season 6 anyway. The only question is Winterfell or Meereen. Like you say, season 5 is complex- and it will be complex enough without rushing through Dany's story. Rushing through Dany means rushing through Tyrion, who has a lot of ground to cover (from Pentos to introducing the Griffs to the Aegon reveal at the Sorrows to getting captured by Jorah to becoming a slave and only then reaching Meereen). Tyrion material would suffocate season 5 and suck away screentime from all the other important storylines if the battle is to happen in episode 9, and this makes the season even more complex.


I agree. As much as I would like the Battle of Mereen at the end of season 5 I think it might work out better at the beginning of season 6, especially since all the preview chapters (that I haven't read, but have read about) make this battle seem complex. And yes, there's the problem of bringing Tyrion and Victarion up to speed. It definitely can be done, but then I'm not sure if there would be sufficient space left for the other stories.
It does seem like the Battle of Winterfell might be easier to bring to completion in a short time.
Right now I could see Dany's arc in season 5 ending like this: pit, Dany flies away, Barristan is left to figure out the poisoning stuff, Dany hangs out with Drogon then meets the Dothraki.
Well now I'm really eager to see who gets cast or not we can get a better idea about all this.

3696	Tyrion1991	2014-05-18	It can't be early season 6 for the Battle of Meereen.
Â 
Its a much bigger battle than Blackwater and would need a lot of CG for the dragons and ships.Â 
Â 
If they do it early season 6 then they wouldn't have the money to have an episode 9 climax for season 6.Â 
Â 
They are pushing forward with Danys arc to get to this point and put the battle in. A cliffhanger just would not work.Â 
Â 
You have no evidence that they will alter the pattern they've been following in structuring the seasons. We have almost finished Sansa and Brans book material. The gap can't get too extreme and at some point the arcs have to get back in sync. Late season 5 is where that will happen. What does the series actually GAIN in delaying the battle into season 6? Which is, the PENULTIMATE season.Â

ep6 On the boat and capture by slavers
ep7 slave and taken to the pit
ep8 Probably goes to convince the Windblown rather than the Second Sons
ep9 Battle of Fire
ep10 Meets Dany
Â 
Even this makes a few big assumptions.
Â 
1- That Penny will even be included
2- That Aegon will be kept a secret from Tyrion. The show has a habit of just revealing things for the audiences benefit.
3- That they won't just have Illyrio in Voltantis to simplify the journey entirely and Tyrion arrives there. I think GRRM uses pirates as the excuse of why Tyrion cannot simply sail to Volantis. This was GRRM trying to do filler by coming up with a reason to prevent Tyrion fast travelling. Â 
Â 
If these are also trimmed down then his travel arc gets a lot simpler.
Â 
They could avoid things like Tyrion playing the fool, the Bear n Maiden Fair menagerie and Jorah being beaten up. That simplifies a lot of his later arc.Â 
Â 
Vic
Â 
Kingsmoot and Euron tells him to go to get Dany. Meets Moqorro after hand gets infected. Converts to red god. Victarion is a very simple character. They've massively shrunk the world down. If Asha can get from the Iron Ilsands to the dreadfort in a few weeks and news can travel so fast its not a stretch to say that Vic can get to Slavers Bay very quickly. Vic won't need that many scenes. hes not exactly the most complex character in the world.

.


Â 
I used to think she would be a 50/50 proposition, but with the compression that the story is undergoing, I think she is in the 'very unlikely' column now.
Â 
If she does come in, I suspect her role may be drastically shortened. Perhaps she may be a victim to the Cersei-driven general slaughter of all dwarfs that Tyrion witnesses. It depends on how they decide to portray the darker Tyrion story.
Â 
Also, how (and even if) they handle Vic will be interesting given that Dany already has a fleet.
3700	Tyrion1991	2014-05-18	I suspect the fleet she has been given will soon be destroyed to restore the balance.
Â 
Â 
Needless to say that there will be A LOT of interest over season 5 casting. Probably more intense than any other season.
Â 
Â 
What concerns me is that D&D said in season 4 interviews that "this is as big as the series gets" and "after this the series starts to contract". Either thats a white lie or there is going to be some major compression of AFFC and ADWD.Â 
Â 
But I don't think Vic will be cut. Even if his attack and use of the horn is a total failure (IMO it is)

Â 
I agree with your breakdown. But you have to admit it makes for a very eventful journey. If we're going by that pace, Dany's story should be super packed as well. We know Jon has a hell of a lot to do too. Arya's training should take quite a bit of screen time as well. Then there's the shocking Cersei storyline and all the other characters. It might work, but right now I can't say I'm entirely convinced. At least nobody would find season 5 as boring as AFFC/ADWD for sure... On the other hand, maybe that would be a case of plot overload.
3702	Annara Snow	2014-05-18	Well, no, I'm not suggesting that the streets of KL are crammed with people lining up to die for Tyrion - Bronn, Jaime and Oberon seem to be the only people left in town that don't hate him.
Â 
I'm saying that if Bronn looks Gregor up and down and simply says "Nope, not fighting that", then that will be poor narrative. Regardless of how much you want to hype up the threat, let's not do it at the expense of established character.


Â 
So you're saying that the show has not only made Tyrion a saint, but Bronn his white knight?
Â 
Gods help us...
3703	Tyrion1991	2014-05-18	Dany
Â 
episode 1 - Dead unsullied and attacks by Harpy. Hidzhars first proposal.
Â 
episode 2 - No Dany this episode (seems to be how they do things for some reason)
Â 
episode 3 - Refuse to help Astapor and burns list of suspects. Hidzhars second proposal.Â 
Â 
episode 4- Refugees from Astapor after cities destruction
Â 
episode 5- Qartheen amabassador arrives offering peace. Dany refuses.
Â 
episode 6- Dany decides to wed Hidzhar.
Â 
episode 7- Daario returns (if he is ever gone) They have lots of sex. Quentyn arrives. Awkward.
Â 
episode 8- Marriage and the pit.Â 
Â 
episode 9 - Battle of Meereen
Â 
episode 10 - Dany meets Tyrion
Â 
They might dispense with the Qartheen amabassador (Xaro being dead n all) to have more focus on Daario or Quentyn but thats still a lot of ground to cover.
Â 
Â 
Also, notice that the battle and meet up only takes up two episodes. The bulk of the season is still spent on ADWD material. Especially if episode 9 were devoted to another finale elsewhere rather than pushing Danys arc forward.Â

What events? You don't know that Shakaz will betray Barristan or that the Green Grace leads the Harpy. Nor is giving a face to those characters really neccesary. You're saying they cannot be cut on the presumption that they are far too important to the plot. So you have no idea which characters are important.
Â 
What I know, is that Danys arc is stretched enough as it is. We get a couple of minutes every episode. Those sort of numbers do not "add up to a happy ending" if they add 2 additional characters to Danys arc. Lets look at who needs to be added next season...
Â 
Victarion
Euron
Doran
Arriane
Sandsnakes
Quentyn
Aegon
Griff
Val
Â 
There is simply no place for additional Ghiscari characters. Thats a massive expansion to the cast up there and Dany has a lot of material to cover in season 5. Introducing additional ghiscari characters would fail. Its not reasonable to expect their inclusion. Even if they were they would be little better than glorified extras. Danys current companions are also massively under developed.They will need their own time as well.


Â 
I don't think that Val is that important and I doubt that she will be included.
3705	jentario	2014-05-18	I suspect the fleet she has been given will soon be destroyed to restore the balance.
Â 
Â 
Needless to say that there will be A LOT of interest over season 5 casting. Probably more intense than any other season.
Â 
Â 
What concerns me is that D&D said in season 4 interviews that "this is as big as the series gets" and "after this the series starts to contract". Either thats a white lie or there is going to be some major compression of AFFC and ADWD.Â 
Â 
But I don't think Vic will be cut. Even if his attack and use of the horn is a total failure (IMO it is)
They said that before season 3, when the show was half as popular. Back then, they were probably thinking that getting six seasons would be a godsend (they even said that the original pitch to HBO was at six or seven seasons). Needless to say, the popularity of the show now ensures a season 7 and leaves 8 as a possibility. This allows the addition of Dorne and the Iron Islands.

I think the Green Grace and the Shavepate are both necessary, assuming the first is the Harpy and the second the poisoner. The Meereen arc is boring enough (to most people, not me though) without cutting these characters. Showing behind the scenes stuff (like Hizdahr meeting with the Green Grace and them plotting the marriage with the Harpy reveal) would add another level to Meereen that is non-existent in the books with the strict POV system.
And that's assuming the season ends with the fighting pits, which may not be the case. If they decide to fit the battle of Meereen into season 5 (which is entirely possible, though would really hurt Tyrion and Victarion/Euron), there'd be no time for these characters in season 5. At this point, I think it'll be better to get the Battle of Winterfell into season 5 rather than Meereen, but I definitely understand the desire to get Dany and her company out of there and headed for Westeros before season 6.


Â 
There will be a lot more time for the machinations in Meereen and the Battle of Meereen in season 5 than it will be for the events in the North. They are already doing a part of Dany's Meereen arc this season. OTOH, Jon will not become LC before the season finale, at the very earliest (I think he will as it's a great season arc ending and setup for season 5). The entire North storyline, which is packed, has to take place in season 5. I can only see Battle of Winterfell happening in season 5, together with the Battle of Meereen, if it happens before Jon's stabbing. If it's after, it will happen early in season 6, since Jon's stabbing is season 5 finale material; and the two battles will get the Red Wedding/Purple Wedding treatment (episode 9/early episode of the next season). In any case, with the way they've accelerated Dany's story, I don't see the Battle of Meereen not happening in season 5. There's plenty of time for Tyrion and Vic to get there before that.
Â 
Also, it's high time the show starts acting like more time has passed, to explain the kids' growth. You can't keep on insisting that Bran is 12 and Sansa is barely 15.

3710	jentario	2014-05-18	Dany
Â 
episode 1 - Dead unsullied and attacks by Harpy. Hidzhars first proposal.
Â 
episode 2 - No Dany this episode (seems to be how they do things for some reason)
Â 
episode 3 - Refuse to help Astapor and burns list of suspects. Hidzhars second proposal.Â 
Â 
episode 4- Refugees from Astapor after cities destruction
Â 
episode 5- Qartheen amabassador arrives offering peace. Dany refuses.
Â 
episode 6- Dany decides to wed Hidzhar.
Â 
episode 7- Daario returns (if he is ever gone) They have lots of sex. Quentyn arrives. Awkward.
Â 
episode 8- Marriage and the pit.Â 
Â 
episode 9 - Battle of Meereen
Â 
episode 10 - Dany meets Tyrion
Â 
They might dispense with the Qartheen amabassador (Xaro being dead n all) to have more focus on Daario or Quentyn but thats still a lot of ground to cover.
Â 
Â 
Also, notice that the battle and meet up only takes up two episodes. The bulk of the season is still spent on ADWD material. Especially if episode 9 were devoted to another finale elsewhere rather than pushing Danys arc forward.Â 

This is very good on paper, but it leaves no chance for other storylines to get their apropriate screentimes. Both Dany and Tyrion would have to appear in every episode and not for short scenes. I don't see how they can fit the twelve other storylines of season 5 into that deal without serious butchery of the plot. I just don't see it working well if a full episode in that season is devoted to one storyline, and the rest of the episodes deal with mostly that one as well.
And honestly the Stannis battle outside Winterfell HAS to happen before the Pink Letter. The show can't jump around in time like the books do. So both battles run cuncurrently in episode 9 of season 5 in this case (not that that would be bad).
Casting season would be crazy this year. Every time an unnamed face would be cast people would ask EURON?! It will be great

So a lot of Dany material gets cut and Tyrion's journey is bare bones and heavy throughout the season. Goodbye Penny, goodbye subtle yet drawn out Aegon reveal. Goodbye Kingsmoot.
Eh. I wouldn't be so sure. Dany is only getting dragon and Daario material from ADWD in season 4, nothing major.

Why do you think that the battle of Winterfell has to happen before the pink letter? I think it will be cooler if Jon gets it before and is stabbed, and, next episode, or maybe one or two after, we find out that Ramsay was making stuff up all along.Â

Â 
Uh, who says that Penny or Kingsmoot have to be cut? Kingsmoot takes up just one - admittedly long - scene, a one or two to set it up, in one episode. Tyrion needs someone to talk to during his journey, I don't think Jorah is enough.
Â 
Without Dany chaining her dragons and having a relationship with Daario (and meeting Hizdahr for the first time), what is there for her in Meereen in season 5, assuming that characters like Shavepate and Green Grace are cut (which I don't believe will happen)? She is surrounded by the Yunkai and there are murders by Sons of the Harpy, so she decides to marry Hizdahr. She tells Quentyn she can't marry him as he came too late, and marries Hizdahr. She's miserable, then we're straight to Daznak Pit. Really? That's not nearly enough material for 5-6 episodes, and it's really boring, if the only mystery is "is Hizdahr a bad guy" and there are no other prominent Meereenese characters.

It takes over a day to open a topic on the TV show discussion boards if it ever is opened and they rarely are.


Â 
There's a season-by-season predictions thread here.
Â 
On topic: Except for only Cat, I think I'm looking forward to Dany the most, which surprises me. She's been a bit boring through the second half of season 3 and beginning of season 4, but I'm really looking forward to seeing some character scenes - which it looks like we'll get this episode. The court scene last week was really good, and I think the whole Meereenese plot could turn out really interesting on screen.
3722	iheartseverus	2014-05-18	I sure hope the no-recap situation this week is a one-time lapse, and not the new normal for the rest of the season(s).Â  It's always been fun when it comes out on Thursday or Friday and kick starts the speculation and discussion from then til the episode actually airs.Â  I'll miss it if its permanently gone!
3723	Tyrion1991	2014-05-18	I am trying to decide if Jorah might end up kissing Dany this episode or not. Can't make up my mind.Â 
Â 
It would be interesting if they took a spin on how after Jorah kisses her in the books she has sex with Irri; only in the show they make it Daario instead. Not sure it adds anything to the characterization or story TBH but they could do it. Personally I don't see the point of having Jorah in love with Dany if that doesn't result in him trying to push other men away from her or trying to, you know, actually get with her. Its also really unrealistic to have a character besotted with another and perfectly accept that he can never have the other character; especially in a series like Ice n Fire. Going with a purely platonic relationship would have made a lot more sense.Â 
Â 
Obviously something happens in the daytime scene and then the night-time scene involves Daario (pretty obviously sex)

They really should do it. They haven't really reminded us of Jorah's feelings for Dany this season and they need to do that before he is banished.

I don't see why you're so sure they can't pull off an early season battle. Just because the two we had so far are in 9 doesn't mean this is an unbreakable mold. And that season could have a non-big-battle episode 9 (I guess the only big battle that could happen at this point in season 6 would be Aegon taking King's Landing). I am sure with GOT's popularity they can sue for a budget increase to allow two battles. I imagine that episode 9 would have multiple climaxes, too (rather than a Blackwater moment).

Â 
I wouldn't say have to. Hes almost certain to bring that up when Dany exiles him as he does in the books. Trying to remember the quote
Â 
Jorah "Daenerys I have loved you"
Â 
Dany - "Don't use that word!"
Â 
N later onÂ 
Â 
Dany bats hand away - "Don't you dare presume to touch me or call me by name again"
Â 
I suppose it would maybe help to contextualize those lines if they do the kiss earlier and they are included (I think somebody mentioned a clip being taken of Dany batting Jorahs hand away which is probably that line but its far from certain). But its a problem because these lines come from a context where Dany is much more intensely aware of Jorahs desire for her and his inappropriate conduct. In the show, he hasn't really done any of those things and certainly not since season 2. I think in season 2 they made Dany aware of this, but its not exactly a glaring issue and source of contention between them as it is in the books.
Â 
Come think of it they probably will heavily alter the exchange between the two. I think in the trailer he says something like "its tempting to see your enemies as evil" which isn't in the books and I am not even sure what it is hes getting at. Â Â

Â 
Nope. There are at least three POV involved in the battle (Vic, Tyrion and Barristan) four if Dany is involved and a host of supporting characters. Jorah, Daario, Tattered Prince etc. They will need a full episode to adapt that battle.Â 
Â 
Winterfell does not involve any major POV (as opposed to 2 at Meereen) characters and its not even certain that the Ironborn will take part in the fight. It will be in but its likely to be a much smaller affair and before the Battle of Meereen. Â

We'd be going into speculation territory about what could happen.
Â 
Theres going to be more than a few big battles. My money is on Dany n Co landing at Oldtown to destroy the Ironborn led by Euron.
Â 
I don't think him taking the city would be a grand battle. Its more likely to be closer to how Dany takes Astapor. The city will in all likelihood fall with a whimper and a scream rather than put up a serious fight with Cersei in charge.

As for Dany, there seem to be a lot of people here who think she will magically teleport from the Dothraki sea to Meereen as soon as the battle is over and just say "fuck this place, let's go to Westeros, yay!!"
Â 
That's not how I see things happening, she will spend some time with the Dothraki, there has to be some resolution to Meereen, and I have no idea what's the deal with Volantis and Pentos (and the tattered prince), but GRRM wouldn't have add all those stuff just to leave it unfinished just because people want Dany in Westeros ASAP.Â

3732	Le Cygne	2014-05-18	The actor who portrays Jorah said he is in love with her, I think it's key to his character motivation in ADWD, however misguided it may be. He could just be shown to love her in a nonsexual way, but it wouldn't make a lot of sense given their interactions on the show, too.
3733	King Tommen	2014-05-18	Even though he hasn't made a physical move on her, I don't think there's any doubt on the show that Jorah is in love with Dany. We get enough tortured looks from him to read this. That's why the Unsullied have called him Ser Friendzone for quite some time.

That is called blackmail.
Â 
Â 
What I meant is that in season 3 and 4 there is little to suggest that Dany is aware that Jorah is in love with her or a suggestion that this is at any point a problem between the two.Lacking that its hard to see them adapting certain bits of dialogue from the exile part of the books.
Â 
Theres one scene way back in season 2 where he touches her arm and she snaps " you are too familiar". But again, theres too much of a gap between that scene and Jorah being exiled for a reference to that scene "don't you dare touch me again" to make sense. It occurred so long ago and Jorah has not done it since that its reasonable to assume that the issue resolved itself. Â

Â 
He's also clearly dismayed at her romantic interest in Daario and looks like he's about to run to him room to throw on some emo music after they come back from the Yunkai invasion and she asks where Daario's at.
Â 
That's not commitment and devotion, that's jealously and being heartbroken.
3740	Tyrion1991	2014-05-18	Because in the books he makes a very direct advance on her and tells her how he feels. Not doing that on the show feels like he accepts that he can never be with Dany. If he loves Dany that much you would reasonably expect him to do something about it. At the very least they would need to explain or provide a reason why he does not; especially since its what he does in the books.Â 
Â 
@ King Tommen
Â 
I disagree. In the books there is much more of a question mark over his actual sense of duty towards Daenerys. In the show hes portrayed in a much more positive light and appears sincere when he says he wants her to sit on the Iron Throne because...shes awesome. In the books he tells her that she looks like his wife. Thats a huge difference in tone and how you present the characters perception of Dany right there.Â 
Â 
Theres jealousyÂ   Â and then there is jealousyÂ  . In the show Jorah has not once told Dany that she should get rid of Barristan and stay away from Daario; even scenes that come close are much more muted, reasonable n one off. In the books he does this repeatedly and Dany is initially patient with this but eventually gets angry at him being possesive of her and acting like shes a foolish little girl who can't make decisions. Completely not the way D&D has portrayed Jorah in the seasons. The main point at the end of the Yunkish scene is that you feel kind of sorry for Jorah; they don't really play on the jealousy angle.Â 
Â 
Essentially they are very different characters and portrayed very differently by GRRM and D&D respectively.Â

Â 
Oh yeah they establish that she knows this in season 2 and I am not denying that. But the show does have Jorah dance around the issue rather than in ASOS where he bluntly tells her.
Â 
The problem is that in the books there are actually consequences resulting from the scene and Jorah kissing Dany dramatically changes the dynamic between the two. In the TV show, its as if it didn't happen. The plot goes on much as it had and nobody ever mentions it again. Which would make suddenly mentioning it when Jorah gets exiled as if its been an ongoing thing would be jarring and make little sense.Â

3743	LaughingTreeMaiden	2014-05-18	That's an awful idea.
The whole point is to build up the Mountain as this really terrifying dude and make it look like Tyrion is in a desperate situation. And Brown is a sellsword, not a self sacrificing martyr.
Why do you think Tyrion is so despondent and saying "If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place"? Because people are just begging for a chance to fight for him?


Â 
Bronn has to be unwilling or unavailable for Oberyn's offer to come through as a life-saving boon. Either they'll go the book way and have Cersei buy him off with a highborn wife and lands (which his TV character is practical enough to accept. they'll obviously leave out Lollys' back story)
Â 
Or the lovely queen regent have him maimed / killed so he can't champion Tyrion even if he wants toÂ  
Â 
I'd say the first scenario is more likely because the show is now projecting Tyrion as someone forsaken by everybody he trusted (Shae, Varys, and Jaime when the "truth about Tysha/Shae" conversation happens)
3744	Lady Sansa's Direwolf	2014-05-18	I've seen several people talking about Brienne's story as well as Lady Stark. Do you think they might do a flashback scene to show how Catelyn becomes LS? As a 'newbie' it would be nice to tie up the story line of her death, the BoB, and resurrection. Otherwise it is going to be hard to grasp how she comes back? Perhaps an early line about magic growing stronger as winter approaches or something. I don't want to feel like "this is who she is and this is where she came from, now suck it up."Â 
Â 
Sorry to see Oberyn go but, as they say, his memory will linger. Is he the one who stole all the potions from Maester Pycelle? Never quite got the rational for having the maester read a long list for one simple potion he already knew was the one use.Â
3745	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-18	^I doubt they would throw any flashback in (kind of corny) especially when they can explain things during a conversation between the characters.
3746	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-18	As far as the Dany and Jorah dynamic, it hasn't been as obvious in the show, but in season 3, iirc, Jorah goes directly to Barristan instead of Dany with his issues of wanting to be the 'one' for her.Â  He did a little sniping at Ser Barry about how he has no idea what the old knight's intentions are, etc.Â  Granted, some of those scenes were to confirm that TV Bar did NOT sit on the Small Council and is therefore not in the know about Jorah's deals with Varys, but still, in S3 and S4, Jorah has shown lots of bits of jealousy at Barristan becoming important to his queen, at both Daario's for even being noticed by his queen, and I won't be surprised if it moves on to Grey Worm, too.Â  He's liable to be confused on which girl the eunich really likes, LOL
Â 
It hasn't been done perfectly, but I think there is enough set up for the Jorah jealousy issues, and Dany's noticing of them, if and when she shows more interest in Daario and/or any other reasons.Â  I think by the end of ADWD, Book Jorah was becoming more realistic about his place in Dany's life and his expectations.Â  I do think, at first, he thought finding Tyrion and offering him up as a gift might be a way to get back in with her and to.....try and win her.Â  But, I think even Book Jorah has FINALLY accepted that it will never be.Â  I do think they can do something inbetween with Jorah on the TV Show.Â
3747	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-18	I really, really can't believe we are down to most likely only 2 remaining episodes with Oberyn.Â  I suspect lots of bitching from me in the off season about all the missed opportunities with him.Â  Still, I am glad we know he has 8 daughters, YOU GO GUY, and that he has an Elia.Â 
Â 
All this to say, I better get some serious Prince of Dorne action tonight.Â  And, not in THE brothel.Â
3748	Karmarni	2014-05-18	The show uses time lines in different ways. Sometimes it's 'previously on', say Season 1, and then they are saying, "Remember this happened? Well, it's important now." But then they'll move scenes and dialogue to entirely different timeline moments to condense storylines and have them be more pertinent to the current action.
Â 
All in an effort, I suppose, to be less confusing to non-book readers. But, I agree, I think they've shown more than enough for Jorah to be jealous of Dany and Daario. It really has to happen. Without it there isn't any tension to her choice, just, "Ho hum, yeah, now they get together."
Â 
I too will miss Oberyn. He's been fantastic and enjoyable to watch. Great attitude.

The only exception I can think of is episode 5, in which I thoroughly enjoyed him. Otherwise, he pretty much got the Loras treatment, in a different fashion.

They got such a brilliant actor, brilliant costumes and brilliant deliveries, but the lines are just always having one worm on them. Perfect dialogue with another character..always includes one lame line.

We've had more Oberyn on the show than in the books. Though, admittedly, he did a lot more with what little he had in the book. Hopefully he gets a lot of screentime in episode eight (though I'm doubtful).

You're assuming she wouldn't talk with Jorah before summoning him before her in the throne room.
Â 
The whole throne room sequence could be a tribunal/offical sentence passing.
Â 
She can still challenge him before that scene, ask Selmy and Greyworm to place him under arrest, then having the evening to be counciled by Daario


Â 
I can't fathom why Dany is half-smiling in the throne room clip. I hope Emilia Clarke doesn't dilute her anger at Jorah's betrayal with that pretty smirk she's been employing of late!

Â 
Thats not how the scene goes at all. Its BARRISTAN who tells Jorah to get lost as his reputation is not good. Jorah and him are having a fairly amicable conversation about Roberts Rebellion and their past experiences up until Barristan tries to do that. Only then does Jorah tell Barristan that hes not going anywhere and talks down to him that he just arrived. Thats not Jorah being jealous of Barristan. Thats show barristan being a dick.Â 
Â 
Show Barristan isn't particularly important to Dany. They've had next to no interaction and outside Meereen the only good thing she has to say about him is that he needs to stay being her bodyguard; whereas with Jorah she gives him a glowing description. She certainly isn't suddenly beholden to Barri and relying on his every word. In the council scene she takes Jorahs argument rather than Barris about going to Westeros straight away.
Â 
There is a bit of hostility with season 3 Daario during the Council Chamber. But, there has not been any this season with new Daario. In fact Daario has not even spoken or acknowledged Jorahs presence or vice versa at all so far as season 4 goes.
Â 
Dany has at no stage brought Jorah up for any "jealousy issues" because there simply are not any on the show. If there was then there would have been the heated arguments they have over this in the books. In particular the one they have after she meets Daario.
Â 
IMO you're assuming that the series is portraying this in exactly the same way as in the books when in fact its extremely different in tone and content. Show Jorah is not jealous. There is no dispute between him and Dany atm. Barristan is the one hostile to Jorah and wants him out; not Jorah. Theres very little in D&D portrayal of Jorah that is similar to the novels. I think Elio and Linda mentioned this on one of the recent reviews on westeros.org as well.Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Oh Jorah is going to get back with Lynesse Hightower in Winds of Winter. It is known. Plus, I bet shes actually hotter than Daenerys. Â  Apparently she looks like the maid made flesh and Mormont is not one to exaggerate.

Â 
I am not so sure. I can see GRRM upsetting peoples expectations. Reading between the lines, she was from a wealthy family and could have had the marriage set aside had she wanted or returned to her family rather than follow him into exile. So she was clearly in love with Jorah and stayed with him for some years before finally going with Ormillion; the circumstances of which are still unclear. Perhaps she felt some measure of blame and left Jorah because she thought she was bad for him? Anyway, her actions don't seem like those of a "bitch".
Â 
Even if there was some jealousy, its heavily watered down compared to how strongly this colors your perception of Jorah in the books. D&D obviously changed this to portray the character in a much more positive light.Â

Since from Sams POV we know that her brother is going to ask her for ships that suggests that they still have a close relationship and that she isn't estranged from the family itself. That suggests shame and self imposed exile. She'd certainly enjoy just a good a quality of life in Oldtown as concubine to an Archon.
3786	Annara Snow	2014-05-18	Oh yes we do actually.
Theon preview chapter -> Battle of Winterfell -> Pink Letter -> Jon's stabbing
there is a timeline online that proves this, and it is pretty accurate.

How does Theon's preview chapter prove anything about the pink letter and Jon's stabbing?

3792	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-18	Melisandre is definitely in finale. There is this shot of her in trailers where she watches something burn - there is ice behind her.
Â 
Considering how Mel is showing Selyse some powders I assume they are at Dragonstone. I'd love for writers to use this opportunity to troll Unsullied more and hint that Stannis is going to KL.


Yea I agree. I'm hoping for as much misdirection as possible, so Stannis's arrival at the wall is as shocking and awesome as it should be for unsullied viewers.Â
3793	Tyrion1991	2014-05-18	Â

Â 
But Jorah never had any money. Lynesse must have known this and her father would have told her that. She did not marry him for money. Also, I wouldn't call the Bear a sugar daddy....Â 
Â 
Shes mentioned in Sams arc. One of Leyton Hightowers sons is going to meet with the "whore of a sister" to ask for ships in Lysene. Plus shes been mentioned by the Old Bear and by the She Bears. If GRRM is introducing the Hightowers as a piece on the Game of Thrones it makes sense that Lynesse will become involved with Dany and therefore Jorahs arc. Especially since they are already in Essos.Â 
Â 
I think it would be more interesting if she still loved Jorah rather than being a total bitch who left him for money. Especially since when Jorah rejoins Dany he is going to be hated by everybody. Dany, Daario, Barristan, Tyrion, Victarion etc. Having another character arrive who validates that opinion wouldn't add anything. Whereas having her of all people take his side would make a better story. GRRM could do as you say. But I don't think that would be very interesting.Â

Lets hope they do a really good job of rehabilitating Stannis.Â  At least one of the PTV Unsullied is pretty disgusted with him right now...
Â 
I don't see anything good about Stannis now, I really don't. We know Davos thinks the world of him, but well, Davos is delusional. Everything he says is exactly opposite to what Stannis actually does.
Â 
Why they did that fake out 'going to the wall' thing last season is really beyond me too. It did not serve any purpose really, except to show that Stannis does exactly what Melisandre says. 'We're going to the wall' - ok. 'Don't kill Davos, I need a scapegoat around'- Done. 'We're not really going to the wall' - Sure.

Um, I've read the Theon chapter. Nobody is questioning that it's after the battle. And since I've read it, I also know that in no way addresses the Pink Letter. Where are you getting the evidence that the Pink Letter was written after the battle?

Yep. I also believe they forgot it, but surely it could include two scenes that would be a dead giveaway. Beric being revived and Catelyn's death. I believe even an Unsullied could put 1 and 1 together there.

I don't think it's in tonight's recap, in finale recap, perhaps. I don't think they'd show Cat's death, on the other hand they have names of actors in main titles which seems like such a stupid thing - it spoils many episodes for Unsullied.

Well the openings this season are pretty unreliable. No Eyrie, Every week the Dreadfort.. and on rewatchs of earlier episodes, almost every opening has some actors in the wrong houses, say the little icon is wrong.

Somehow I don't expect them to assume everyone to have forgot the Stannis scene in the season 3 finale. Most know he's heading north so it won't be much of a surprise when he saves the day at The Wall. But it will be amazing and shatter the 'evil' impression unsullied viewers have of him.

Kinda depends on what kind of mood the show runners want, and they can do that with lighting, music, etc.. The music should be new: the original Stannis theme, just slightly less dark and more "heroic". Warrior of Light is pretty cool! but it needs to be more uplifting to show Stannis in a more positive light.

Â 
I mean, what the hell is this all about?
Â 
https://www.youtube....h?v=GrjPj3fLfG8


Â 
Agreed. And let's not forget that scene in season 2 where he says to Dany "there are times when I look at you and I still can't believe that you are real" after fanboying over here for an entire speech (and Dany's look afterwards which basically said "awkward... creepy awkward..."). Also, they still have time to film the kiss, if they really want to hammer in how much Jorah wants her.
Â

Yeah this following OC is extremely elegant but there is no way they can do anything in final scene of the season to top LS reveal. It would be like having Stannis arrive in 20th minute of the battle and then just show random wildlings getting killed, except here it's worse because that plot twist has been building up for this pay off the entire season - it's season climax moment, not episode ending moment, at least for me.

Agreed, nothing major happens again with the Wall storyline until episode 9 when it ALL happens. And yes this episode should end with Only Cat.I like the idea of starting with the Snow Castle, having another scene in the middle and ending with Only Cat.


nah 2 scenes max. that storyline really is pretty thin overall and with the amount of other stuff they need to squeeze in that would be too much.
3829	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2014-05-18	I don't think we'll see LS tonight, I think the best we can hope for is Brienne finding some hung corpses of Freys with signs that says "they broke guest right".

I want to say that Stannis scene was originally supposed to be in a different episode, possibly the premiere and had to be moved to Martin's due to time so it wasn't Martin that wrote it. I could be mistaken though.

If they thought the story would have had too many characters they shouldn't have started filming.
Â 
Next thing you come up with merging fAegon and Quentyn, because they are actually quite the same, both wanna marry Dany and both related to the Martells.Â 
Â 
Seriously, if you don't like the Essos part, fine, but don't say they should and could cut most of it.

But think about this: Next season we will likely get nothing from Bran except 5 minutes and nothing of Osha and Rickon, Sansa will be extremely small, Tywin scenes are gone, Olenna scenes are gone, Hound, there are so many characters gone that there is plenty of space for new ones.
Oh and don't forget, we got rid of the North scenes with Robb and Cat etc that took up quite some time. We saw this season that they do not lack time, only material. So much filler for most characters, because other characters are far more advanced in the story than others.Â

Plead your case elsewhere. Neither you or I run the show. I simply said "they could". And they can. Rage on everyone.
3860	kjm16216	2014-05-19	Even that, they have gallows and Ser Ilyn Payne and dungeons.Â  I don't think they throw criminals to the friendly neighborhood psycho so he can get his jollies killing them.

Or maybe they do.
3861	Metopheles	2014-05-19	Even if the Mountain is a pure monster and horrible person, he is one awesome warrior. It took a young Loras Tyrell to defeat him. And poison.
Seriously, if I were to chose a champion, I would take him. Or in war, he's the man.Â 
Â 
I bet he would have been able to kill a dragon alone. Or a direwolf pack.
3862	rmholt	2014-05-27	Oh if you read it, you would know that it happened minutes after Asha's last chapter. He is still outside Winterfell and starts planning.Â 
I don't know what you want with it proving something, I just said that the timeline is not in the order you suggested. The pink letter is after the battle. Theon's preview is before the battle. I don't know what you want.


Â 
Â 


Â 
Um, I've read the Theon chapter. Nobody is questioning that it's after the battle. And since I've read it, I also know that in no way addresses the Pink Letter. Where are you getting the evidence that the Pink Letter was written after the battle?
Â 
Â 
Â 
What, some fan on the Internet made a timeline that assumes that the Pink Letter was written after the battle - and that's your evidence that it was written after the battle?
Â 
Really?!
Â 
Or are you saying it must be written after the battle because it says so in the letter? Because there's no way it may not be true... Riiiight? 


Â 
Â 
I dont think the letter is written after the battle necessarily, Ramsay could be lying. Â I bet it's after Theon leaps and before the battle. This is because I refuse to believe Stannis loses!

3906	cade	2014-05-19	"Take off your clothes"


Â 
Love how Emilia Clarke delivered that line. Has my vote for sexiest scene of the entire series.
Â 
"The slaves you've freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
Â 
"I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the Masters of Yunkai."
Â 
Both those lines from Jorah are points sorely lacking from the books, imo.
3907	Rouge	2014-05-19	This was a good episode for quotes. Oberyn's entire scene was near-perfection. Arya and the Hound had a great exchange. Tyrion and Bronn exchanged great one-liners. And many more. Twas epic.

3909	The Last Reyne	2014-05-19	I agree the whole scene between Tyrion and Oberyn was awesome, the best so far this season and one of the best scenes in the entire series in my opinion.
3910	Mini Ghost	2014-05-19	1. Arya: Thank you! (Then gives Rorge the pointy end)Â 
2. Oberyn and Tyrion scene. Made me cry when Oberyn was telling Tyrion about the little Lannister monster. I loved PD controlled anger/crying.Â

3911	The King Of Cooked Steak	2014-05-19	The whole scene of Oberyn telling Tyrion the story of how they first met was just perfect. The acting, the writing, the chemistry, the emotion, it was all just perfect.

More or less, yes. I'm glad they kept it mostly intact. They have a habit of trying to fix what isn't broken on this show and I was very pleased with this particular scene. Pedro Pascal absolutely nailed it. And Peter Dinklage did an incredible job too.
3913	Le Cygne	2014-05-19	I'll second "Take off your clothes."

3916	Allison of Tarth	2014-05-19	Daario's "Jorah the Andal" made me laugh because he seemed to lose his accent, and I wanted him to follow up with "sup brah". 
Oberyn's lines with Tyrion totally did it for me.  "I have come to the perfect place [for justice]".
Chills. CHILLS!

You're not alone. Many men are starting to doubt about their own sexuality due to the Viper.
3918	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-19	Daario's "Jorah the Andal" made me laugh because he seemed to lose his accent, and I wanted him to follow up with "sup brah". Yeah he almost lost his accent there. And for a second I thought I was watching Orphan Black (he has a recurring role on that this season too) because his accent was almost the same. I don't suppose it helped that the scene with Dany was similar to a scene in the latest Orphan Black where a female character tells a male character to strip in a similar commanding voice!

Am I missing something? Eddard did not let him go; he fled. The reason Jorah is in that part of the world at all is that Eddard Stark was going to take his head off for the crime of trading slaves. Therefore if Eddard hadn't wanted to do to Jorah what Dany wants to do to Yunkai, Jorah would never have been a fugitive and met her.

Alas, the second best lines, after the Oberyn-Tyrion conversation:
Â 
Hot Pie: "You cannot give up on the gravy!"
Â 
Dying man, after taking a sip: "Wish it was wine"
Hound: "Me too"
Â 
Jaime: "Carefull, i'm the last friend you've got."

I knew it was coming but it still broke my heart so much. I think it is the first time Tyrion receives true compassion, when Oberyn says how his sister and him did not see a monster but a baby, albeit awkward looking but still a baby.Â Â Pascal's narration and Dinklage's face were heart wrenching.
3949	Tyrion's Third Wife	2014-05-19	Special shout out to the line: "No. Tell him you changed my mind."


Â 
I have a feeling this is going to come back to haunt her. She feels so trusting of him, and when she learns of his earlier betrayal, she's going to doubt all the counsel he's ever given her and feel such a fool. (Even if the counsel was sincere - how would she know?)
3950	Newstar	2014-05-19	Loved Jaime "praising" Tyrion's speech:
"They'll be talking about it for days to come."
There's no shade like Lannister shade.
3951	Glass	2014-05-19	I loved the "Your sister" line.Â 
I believe that this is stolen from the comics, but he says "Only Cat?" That's pretty cool. I think it's better the way they did it, because the TV show is different than the books in a few aspects. Still, it would have been awesome either way.Â

Â 
"That's not a monster," I told Cersei. "That's just a baby."
Â 
I feel like it's the first time TvTyrion hears someone (aside from Jaime) calling him the exact opposite of a freak/monster... Oberyn's saying, "You're as normal as the rest of us, with a slightly larger head and shorter arms/legs." I think it's quite profound, actually.Â (It's slightly different in the books but the effect is the same).

As did I. Seems like there's quite a few of us who did... it was just that perfect.Â
3981	Ice Wolf	2014-05-19	^
Dinklage's reaction to the line was spot on as well.
3982	Mad Monkey	2014-05-19	I like how Brienne did not say, "I'm looking for a highborn maid of three-and-ten". The general "buddy cop" back and forth between Podrick and Brienne was good too.I kind of liked Selyse chanting her lines from a couple of seasons ago ("nothing done in service of the Lord can ever be a scene" and "I'm thankful for him bringing you to him"). When she said it before it sounded really passionate, like she was genuinely pleased that Stannis was cheating on her, but now it seems clear that she can barely stand it and only her faith is keeping her from coldcocking Mel with her tiara and running to grab her man.

Oberyn's whole speech was fantastic too and the way he delivered "What about what I want?"

ETA: Â There's another one, too, that I just can't remember the details of. Â It came from the scene with Oberyn and Tyrion, about Oberyn and Cercei having more in common that O thought, in that they both wanted a Lannister dead??? Â 
Â 
Also after Oberyn had told the monster story, including that even then Cersei had wanted Tyrion dead, when Tyrion said, "And sooner or later Cersei always gets what she wants."

Another favorite:Â  "If you've come for justice, you've come to the wrong place." 
and an honorable mention:
Right after Sandor explains he stabbed the dying man in the heart because that is what you do to kill a man,Â Â  Arya uses her lesson and stabs RorgeÂ  the heart.Â  The quote is what Sandor says right after that, givingÂ praise....Â  "You're learning."Â

I agree, my favorite. Dany acting smart.
3994	Faceless Man Friday	2014-05-20	So many great quotes I liked them all. Â The one line that keeps playing in my head though is the Hound's line after Arya recognizes Rouge. Â The Hound knows what is coming next even though Rouge doesn't suspect a thing. Â

Once again, welcome to the Discussing Sansa thread where we discuss, analyze and theorize Sansa's storyline in the TV show. Spoiler alert from the title is enforced so please, if you haven't read the ASOIAF series, continue with caution.
Â 
Now, given the experience from the last thread where some people consciously derailed the thread into discussion about Barristan Selmy, Communism, Nazis and God knows whatever, I will issue this polite reminder that this thread, as its title says, is all about Sansa, those whom she interact with, those who are part of her story. Thus, the only topic that is to be discussed is Sansa and currently Vale subplot. Any other debate whether it is about Amazonian forests, Vladimir Putin or Rhoynars and is not connected with Sansa in any way, will be discouraged and should take place where they belong.
Â 
And now, given the promo we are bound to see two things: Snow castle scene, which today brings heavyÂ Frozen references and of course "Only Cat" moment which many of us have been waiting for quite some time. Since this thread has been opened before the airing of the episode 4.07 to evade possible overload of the site, you are free to discuss here before, during and after episode. As usual, I invite you all to share whatever you think about this episode, the observations, book parallels and deviations etc.

4021	GinesthoiOfIce	2014-05-18	It did not even hold a candle to the book version. I can understandÂ how hard it would have been to find a way to render the internal monologue, but the rest...I mean honestly they could have kept every bit of dialogue from the book and it would have been so much more intense. They give Oberyn as many book lines as they can manage to fit in pretty much, but with Sansa nope. The whole setting with Lysa in the background seeing the kiss looked almost like a soap opera to me. And 'your sister' instead of 'Only Cat' ? And seriously that shove looked ridiculous if you ask me. So, so disappointed !
Now wondering what they're doing next week considering the preview... Sansa's testimony could undo Petyr it seems...
Â 
On the bright side :
Actually included Snow Winterfell.
Â 
To think about :
They did not include the doll tearing...Perhaps getting rid of a foreshadowing ?

Robin is an spoiled brat, but apparently doesn't share the same sickness as his book counterpart, I wonder how that will impact in future episodes (he doesn't seem to be dying anywhere soon, which is part of LF's plans).Â

Yeah, I assumed we wouldn't get the Vale Lords until 10. Does this mean Sansa's cliffhanger for the season is going to be from her last AFFC chapter? Feels rushed.

4029	Alayne's Shadow.	2014-05-18	Weird pacing. Of course, It's still a Sansa scene, so It's always a 10 for me, but... Well, it sounded more like LF seduced her rather than forcibly kissed her.

Â 


Maybe because she might have more TWOW material?
Â 
On the whole, a bit of a letdown. Too rushed for my liking and not intense enough! They could have atleast kept some of the dialogue. They established it very well with Oberyn and Prince Tyrion (who btw even after a great speech last week seems to yet again get the most amount of the damn screentime!)

Well he could always get sick later. Maybe he'll come down with some illness.

Kind of surprised Sansa slapped Sweetrobin.


Â 
these two posts are making me wonder if they made robin healthy so that when the sweet sleep is administered, it will be clear what the motives are and that sansa is agreeing to it. d&d love to have set things up at one end of the pendulum to make the swing to the other end that much more noticeable.Â
4036	Dirk blitzen	2014-05-18	Looks like they're making Sansa more of a player than in the books.  In the preview for the next episode it appears Sansa (as witness to lysas fall) will corroborate littlefinger story, lying for him so he can remain in charge of the vale and whatnot

Before I go off on a tangent rage about my utter displeasure with the one scene I was looking forward too in this entire convoluted mess we call Game of Thrones....are we getting some heavy duty foreshadowing here? Let me explain:
Â 
"Sansa's not a killer...yet."
Did she just say she'd LIKE IT if Robin threw people who displeased her out of the Moon Door?
And then the smile after Petyr says, "What do we do to those who hurt the ones we love?"
Â 
Is Sansa about to turn into a vengeful killer person? Cause I feel like they're subtly moving her towards that route.Â

i wouldn't say vengeful killer person but there's no doubt that sansa's being set up to kill. tyrion's line about her not being a killer yet, slapping robin when she was angry with him and smiling when she hears littlefinger explain that you hurt people who hurt you or your loved ones. plus, she's far more aggressive with littlefinger than she ever was in the book. this is the second time she's demanded something from him.

Conversely, they're apparently completely removing her assenting to the framing of Marillion (or Marillion-replacement).

4044	Scrambled Aegon	2014-05-18	I knew the snow castle part wouldn't live up to the books because it's all based around GRRM's wording and the internal thoughts, and you can't convey that as well on a show. But I can't believe how much the Only Cat scene disappointed me. :/
4045	ohpooratlas	2014-05-18	It really wasn't bad but like someone said before ... it just doesn't hold a candle to the original book scene.
Â 
I think my only true gripe was the fact that it wasn't longer. I really wanted an epic Lysa monologue/rant.
Â 
And I wanted "Only cat" too. It's a minor nitpick, one I'll live with. But there you go.
4046	Scrambled Aegon	2014-05-18	That's exactly my problem. Lysa went on and on and on in the books and became more and more unhinged as it went on, and Kate was one of the best members of the entire cast, so I don't know why they decided to cut out like 90% of her rambling.
4047	MR92	2014-05-18	we definitely could of gotten a LIL more lysa rant considering her quick demise...and i realllllllly wanted only cat... he repeated "only" twice! i thought we were gonna get it! but all in all im pleased. Â Im starting to accept it all and embrace the difference! Sansa looks more and more beautiful with each episode call me creepy IDGAF shes only 3 years my junior in real life

Â 
They cut the whole damn scene as far as I'm concerned! First off, there was no build up to the scene. One minute we're in Tyrion's cell....the next we're watching Sansa walk outside in the snow. WTF? Then, they couldn't wait more than two seconds for her to really take in the fact that it was snowing? Like, shit man. And why was her kiss with LF so...consensual? I saw ZERO struggle. She hardly pushed him away (which makes me think that they really AREN'T going to play this "creepy" like Aidan said. It'll be more of a consensual thing). There was no built up tension, no going increasingly crazy with every sentence...nothing.
Â 
And here's what REALLY bothered me: they still had about 8 minutes they COULD have used to develop that scene, but instead, rushed the hell out of it and then ended the episode. Â  What a crock!
Â 
In less abrasive news...I did LOVE her conversation with Robin. And the slap. Only redeeming part of the scene.
Â
4049	Newstar	2014-05-18	Also kind of surprised at how the kiss was blocked/shot...an Unsullied viewer might reasonably conclude that TV Sansa seemed into it; she closed her eyes and everything. It's not SO far out of book canon--Book Sansa yielded briefly to LF's kiss before shoving him off--but I was somewhat surprised.
The way it was shot kind of reminded me of the Joffrey/Sansa kiss in Season 1. I wonder if that was intentional.
					
					
							Edited by Newstar, 18 May 2014 - 10:55 PM.
4050	sastelise	2014-05-18	I agree with some of the other posters that it appears Sansa's storyline is going in the direction of her conspiring with and perhaps being seduced by LF.Â I don't think Lysa revealedÂ enough in her final moments about LF's involvement in getting the whole chain of events that led to her father's death started.Â I don't seeÂ how she'll be able to piece it together now.Â This is not how I hoped the story would evolve for Sansa, but it'sÂ interesting anyway. I wonder how they'll explain Lysa's fall since there was no one else present. I really like how the pieces came together in this episode for Sansa's story. Breianne now suspects that both Sansa and Arya will beÂ at the Eyrie. The hound and Arya seem to be bonding more than in the books; I can't imagine how they will part ways.Â It almost seems like Bre and the hound willÂ meet on the way to the Eyrie instead of at the QI, and this has potential for Sansa's story.

Yeah. 'Cause D&D are really big on subtlety. ;-)
4052	Empress In The North	2014-05-18	With Sansa apparently not being afraid of slapping (impulsive or not) and rather harshly reprimanding (genuinely made me pause and think) Robin's actions with the Snow Castle, could this mean some changes when Sansa becomes the de-facto Lady Regent of the Vale? Does this stem from the show not really enforcing the idea that Sansa is now Alayne at the moment?
Â 
Unless I'm completely wrong and something similar happened in the books. Its been a while.
Â 
Also, "He is MINE!!!111!ONE1!!" - did that make anybody else jump or was that just me?

4056	Stannisneverlikedcats	2014-05-18	I'm still hoping for Sansa to snowball LF in the face, maybe it will happen in the next few episodes instead? Like maybe after he makes her lie to the lords of the vale.
4057	Another Locust	2014-05-18	D&D really dropped the ball with this one. It just seemed rushed, lacking, and almost contradictory to the books. Way to go.

4058	juanml82	2014-05-18	I may be misremembering, but didn't Sansa push LF away after the kiss, and feel really uncomfortable. It didn't give me that impression in the show. Robin is an spoiled brat, but apparently doesn't share the same sickness as his book counterpart, I wonder how that will impact in future episodes (he doesn't seem to be dying anywhere soon, which is part of LF's plans).Â 




Weird pacing. Of course, It's still a Sansa scene, so It's always a 10 for me, but... Well, it sounded more like LF seduced her rather than forcibly kissed her.


The relationship between them is changed from the books. In the show, they are a lot closer to partners. I guess Sophie's appearance was one of the reasons for the change. She's too old and big to play Book!Sansa, so the character is more mature.
It remains to be seen, but it looks like Show!LF won't be sexually harassing her - certainly not like in the books.

I said it in the books forums. And there is nothing subtle in the show. She won't be a fountain of mercy and kindness. She will reappear with a vengeance... someday.
Â 


That's exactly my problem. Lysa went on and on and on in the books and became more and more unhinged as it went on, and Kate was one of the best members of the entire cast, so I don't know why they decided to cut out like 90% of her rambling.


Maybe, combined with the whole "What do we do to those who hurt the ones we love?" line, TV!Sansa would immediately sell LF over if she has reasons to believe LF hurt her family so much. So she doesn't have to know... yet.

4059	HouseHarrison	2014-05-18	The fact that Sophie Turner could pass for 25 and towers over everyone sort of took away from Baelish's creeper moment
Â 
Also a lot of the Moondoor scene was off because I think D&D were worried that the audience couldn't process so much information so quickly. Half of show watchers think Dany's name is Khaleesi, would they really understand who "Cat" is and the whole deal with Lysa's husband?
4060	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-18	This situation really gets my goat! You guys see my goat in the corner over there? Well, this situation is getting it!
Â 
Anywho. Let me throw down my wild conspiracy theories, cause no post of mine would be complete without vague plot analysis and rampant speculation.
Â 
Check me: I don't think they're going to introduce Harry. I think they will make her engagement to Robin be the "potential" for her to take ownership of the Vale (which is also probably why Robin isn't sickly in the show. He's going to be around for a while). Meanwhile, Sansa covers for LF and they establish an, "I saved your ass, you saved mine....we're even," kind of relationship. From that point on, they plan and plot to take over the world (Pinky and the Brain style). She will use seduction and manipulation to control him. Then, he'll try and kill Robin which will then make her kill him.
Â 
I think they're moving through her story so quickly because nothing about the 'plan' in AFFC will matter (and really, why go through a whole Harry storyline when she can become the same exact thing (Lady of the Vale) by marrying Robin). Which means, next season, they can just continue developing her relationship with Robin and LF. Â
4061	Fat Trell	2014-05-18	I did not enjoy how the show castle scene played out. Robert seemed genuine in his efforts to help Sansa. Her reaction, though justifiable, seemed somewhat childish.
Â 
Heights freak me out and the moon door terrifies me as a concept. Thought that scene was well done by all involved .
4062	Stannisneverlikedcats	2014-05-18	I always thought it was a bit of a plot hole why Sansa doesn't dwell on Lysa's admissions after that part in Storm. I know she re-thinks it only once in the next book but then it's never brought up again. Just like how she suddenly remembers Jon Snow exists a few chapters later when she hears some news from the North.

Seems possible. And, with all the material waiting for them in season 5, it makes sense that they streamline arcs where they can. I'm not so sure about TV!Sansa reacting in that fashion to Robin's death. I think it's more likely that she, somehow, finds out about LF's actual relationship with Ned and does the thing they do to those who hurt loved ones.
It may add more internal conflict if, after so many rounds of (TV) consensual kissing, she does develop feelings for him. But maybe they'll turn her into a more cold blooded vengeance machine. It fits the show's style better.

4064	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-18	First off, Robin reminded me of this
Â 
Now, did they just...did they...whitewash Robin, just a bit? I mean, he destroyed the castle tower by accident. He was actually being relatively nice, albeit in a sociopathic way, and it was only when they started arguing that he kicked the shit out of the castle. I'm all for it, I have a soft spot for the little brat
Â 
Also, I agree that the whole sequence felt rushed. It's one of those cases in which they should have spaced the scenes throughout the episode. But all in all, I think it was...fine. I didn't like how Sansa didn't recoil from the kiss, even though she said she did when Lysa was pushing her.

lol! Thats cute. I totally get the disappointment over this scene. It would have to be like, totally differently presented for it to have the same impact the book version had. Like, literally voice-overs of the other Starks and stuff. (it would come off a bit cornball if they went that route) I actually was ok with Robin being kind of adorable up until he got shitty. Her smacking him is basically the ripping off of the doll's head only theres no doll. It really is the first time Sansa ever raises her hand to anyone in the show. Shes tried to push Joffers off battlements but got stopped before actual handraising happened. So its still a pretty big moment for her. Shes not going to take anyone's petty torment and bullshit.Â 
Â 
I have no idea how they are gonna resolve the "Who killed Lysa?" plot. There has been no potential patsy presented and yeah, its annoying. I also agree that there will be no Harry the Heir and he will be composited into Sweetrobin.Â 
Â 

Â 
I didn't like how Sansa didn't recoil from the kiss, even though she said she did when Lysa was pushing her.

She seemed like this was going through her head: "What the hell is happening? Is he really kissing me? Should i like, push him away? Should i go along with it for my own sake? Im not sure i really want to piss him off. He murders people....This is uncomfortable and if Aunt Lysa finds out im fucked...And i just...Man...at least he isnt giving me tongue. Ok, he really needs to like, not kiss me anymore...." It looked awkward as fuck. She didnt balk, but shes like "uhhhhhh....."

This is going to be another Jamie/Cersei scene, except in reverse. So, instead of filming a scene in which the female protagonist was SUPPOSED to appear horrified, uncomfortable and unwilling, they filmed a consensual kiss scene. Go figure!

What's with the damn directing this year? FML.
4070	BurningCandle	2014-05-19	I think I've figured out how Peter & Sansa will explain this.

The Vale lords will eat it up.

That was my first reaction, but then I remembered, isn't she still like, 15? That's how most kids are at 15, they have spurts of adult behavior with random mixes of childishness thrown in. So I think it probably was ok for Sansa to act that way since she's had to be so grown up for so long.

That, and the whole point of her snow castle is her reliving a moment of her lost and destroyed childhood. Her home and all her childish abandon was represented in the snow castle. When Robin breaks it, she begins to get upset. When he stomps on it, shes very upset. Yet another jerk to stomp all over Sansa's feelings and she wasnt having none of that. Thats why she smacks him.

Â 
That's the point. She is starting to feel for the first time in a while like she's safe, so she's not on her guard, and her only companion is the childish Robin. Makes sense she might return to her snarky commentary self (the way she was with Arya in the beginning) even if it's just temporary.
4074	Raksha 2014	2014-05-19	I noticed in this episode that the youngster playing Robin has shot up in height. Â Checked Wikipedia and found out that the actor is 13. Â Am I the only one who thought his voice was on the verge of cracking during his scene with Sansa tonight? Â By next year, or even this summer, he could be ready to shave, a few inches taller, and Sansa's new role as Robin Arryn's substitute mother will lose credibility, because Robin is physically obviously moving out of childhood and Sansa is a pretty young woman. Â Her tucking him in as he begs for bedtime fairy tales...can't see it with this actor. Â Not the boy's fault, he did a good job in the episode. Â 
Â 
I am very disappointed that they didn't have Sansa's discomfort with LF's kiss more obvious. Â I really hope they aren't setting her up as an opportunistic manipulating female version of Littlefinger.

Oy vey!!! I don't even want to go down the road of "developing feelings". I'm still reeling and on the verge of drinking straight up Vodka about the damn consensual kiss (I always want to write "consensual sex" for some reason). Adding on the possibility of "developing feeling" is just too much for my soul to deal with at the moment. Â  It could very well happen though. I definitely would not discount it at this point. Also, I'd love to see a cold-blooded and vengeful Sansa. Makes me hopeful that she'll serve a purpose other than being the perpetual "damsel in distress".

4079	Colonel Green	2014-05-19	Then, he'll try and kill Robin which will then make her kill him.


Why would he try to kill Robin if he's not planning to replace him with Harry?Â  Also, they're bringing in Waynwood next episode.
4080	BurningCandle	2014-05-19	That, and the whole point of her snow castle is her reliving a moment of her lost and destroyed childhood. Her home and all her childish abandon was represented in the snow castle. When Robin breaks it, she begins to get upset. When he stomps on it, shes very upset. Yet another jerk to stomp all over Sansa's feelings and she wasnt having none of that. Thats why she smacks him. I didnt think her childish, i thought her human.


Really good point, I agree. The more I think about it the more I think it was a good way for her to respond.
4081	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-19	Â 
Oy vey!!! I don't even want to go down the road of "developing feelings". I'm still reeling and on the verge of drinking straight up Vodka about the damn consensual kiss (I always want to write "consensual sex" for some reason). Adding on the possibility of "developing feeling" is just too much for my soul to deal with at the moment. Â  It could very well happen though. I definitely would not discount it at this point. Also, I'd love to see a cold-blooded and vengeful Sansa. Makes me hopeful that she'll serve a purpose other than being the perpetual "damsel in distress".
Â 
Â 
And here...I wanted ALL of that!! GIVE ME ALL OF THAT!!!!! Â  Make me cry like a little bitch!!! Damnit man! Wasted the best scene in the fooking books! 


/patpat
I really dont see her kiss as overly consensual. Its awkward as hell and we are supposed to go "eeww dude, LF, you fucken creep." Shes like, "i just dont even know how to react right now..." And i dunno. i kinda saw her as wanting to shove him away but was kind of afraid to? Shes pretty rigid at that moment and not really returning the kiss? Im just surprised they had them kiss at all.Â 
Â 
loool you wanted the cornball. I wont lie, i kinda wanted the cornball sap too. Im actually pretty cool with it mostly cuz she build that swirly part of Winterfell somehow and that just warmed my cold, black little heart. Its a letdown from what we expected, but i think it coulda been a lot freaking worse.Â
4082	Lady Beyond the Wall	2014-05-19	Did her hair seem to be worn in "northern style" or am I off the rocker?
4083	El Guapo	2014-05-19	She did seem to have kind of a shocked look on her face after she eventually pushes him away.
4084	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-19	Why would he try to kill Robin if he's not planning to replace him with Harry?Â  Also, they're bringing in Waynwood next episode.


Â 
That's a good point that I never even thought to work out in my head until you brought it up. Why must you make me engage in critical thinking so late in the evening?Â  Â  Where the hell is my thinking cap? *Puts on 49ers hat* Ok. So. Why would LF kill Robin? *Seriously thinks about it* Damn. I got nothing. Maybe he turns "problematic" somehow? I'm not sure, tell you the truth. Â
4085	greensleeves	2014-05-19	What did people here make of Lysa's "blue eyes staring at nothing" line?
Â 
Â 
Also, I really disagree with everyone saying Sansa's arc is about breaking her away from fantasy/childhood dreams. Â That might be true if you stop at Game of Thrones, but Sansa's arc is about being built up in addition to being broken down. Â 
Â 
The 'snow castle' scene in particular is about her reaffirming her dreams and desires. Â She builds the home of her childhood and doesn't let it get knocked down. Â She defends it.
4086	Martin Lasarte	2014-05-19	I think in the next episode Sansa and LF will meet the Lords and he'll try to convince them that Lysa's death was an accident. Sansa will notice their escepticism and will stand up to "tell the truth" about Lysa: she killed herself. And she will convice them. It'll be a great scene for Sophie.
4087	Colonel Green	2014-05-19	My tally of Sansa-related bits we haven't seen yet in the show:
Â 
- Littlefinger demanding to know whose side the person he's talking to is on (probably Sansa, in episode 8).
- Shot of angry Sansa walking purposefully somewhere (8 or 10?).
- Littlefinger's bit of dialogue from one of the ads about how she's not a child anymore (8 or 10?).
4088	The Taxman	2014-05-19	I gotta say it looked like Sansa enjoyed that kiss.
4089	Colonel Green	2014-05-19	I'm not really clear what to make of the repeated scenes of Sansa insisting on Littlefinger's "real" motivation, because what he told her back in episode 4 was far closer to the truth than what he says here (unless what he said was supposed to be true, but I really can't imagine that, because it makes no sense).Â  So we're not seeing a progression of uncovering the truth, though Sansa may think that's what she's doing; but it's presented in such a way that I suspect casual viewers might buy it, because it resembles a progression.

I wasn't sure myself.  But as someone posted in another thread,  it's one of his many ploys.  And she is quickly learning what Petyr Baelish is about and TV audience is learning right along with her.
it will occur to TV Sansa as it did to book Sansa, what did he ever do to help her beyond getting power over the only known living heir to Winterfell?
Sure, she'll play along with P, but after killing her aunt Sansa and the TV audience is unlikely to feel safe with him.
I think Petyr kissing Sansa might have been an error he will eventually rue, hopefully fatally & hopefully sooner than expected.
BTW, all the non-ASOIAF readers in the room were blown away by Baelish shoving Lysa out the Moon Door.
Poor SR. Poor Sansa.  I'm wondering what changes will be made by even more devilish TV Petyr  to imperil their lives, happiness and souls.  He really uses every decent impulse of Sansa's to make her more cynical and hard hearted. I can't wait for Sansa to use all he's taught her and blabbed to her in the books to be turned against him eventually.

4091	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-19	On the bright side :
Actually included Snow Winterfell.
Â 
To think about :
They did not include the doll tearing...Perhaps getting rid of a foreshadowing ?


Â 
Â 
I think you are right that a slap was not quite as symbolic, but both Sweetrobin and Sansa are aged up, so he's not going to be playing with dolls, plus they didn't go with his shaking spells (yet?) so a few things had to change.
Â 
I can live with the scene, though without a nearby patsy for the next scene, how will they explain it to the young lord that his mother fell off the mountain ?
4092	north of the wall	2014-05-19	I liked the winterfell scene. Wasn't entirely right but I felt it had the nuts and bolts of it and I liked Sansa slapping Robin. I thought the kiss was pretty much right maybe could have made Sansa shoving him off a bit mor obvious but I still got it. 
The moon door was rushed though. I wanted more crazy Lysa and when I told my hubby she was meant to spill her guts about Jon Arryn and be crazier and LF should have said "only Cat" instead of "your sister" he just looked at me and said its the same thing. 
So I guess it came across alright for the unsullied.
I am interested to see who or what they blame on Lysa's death and I am interested to see how LF and Sansa interact in the future. But all in all I was happy enough with the episode. A little more crazy Lysa would have made it perfect but was still pretty good.
4093	Takiedevushkikakzvezdy	2014-05-19	They basically need TWOW material now to advance Sansa`s story. Unless the want to show Littlefinger trying to make out with her for an entire season.

4095	Hellothere	2014-05-19	With the speed of Sansas storyline is nobody else worried that the show is going to start spoiling the books? Â Does anybody know has there been any word on this from the makers? Â
4096	Mladen	2014-05-19	I have to ask what is with D&D's inability to adapt such beautiful scenes of Sansa's arc? I mean, this sucked... On so many levels...
Â 
Ok, let me dissect this. It all started nice, her walking out on the snow, "Winterfell" tune playing, her building the castle in silence, this is where the tune should have kept on... Now, SR... I am torn about this. On one hand, there is understanding of SR not playing with the dolls, and that piece of foreshadowing means nothing for Unsullied given that we haven't seen the story of Baelish's sigil on the show. Slap also felt more natural, even when LF compared it to the maternal role she will be playing for SR in the future. But, I didn't like the conversation with Robin...
Â 
Now, with LF. Let we be clear about this, before we start arguing that nonsense that Sansa liked any kiss with LF in the books. She doesn't. LF has to force himself on her for those kisses, and she has resisted every each one of them. So, no. What we saw here, IDK, what happened... Are we now talking of yet another scene of bad editing, like with Cersei/Jaime? Or was this intentional? Well, TBH, she didn't feel comfortable, and certainly the angle someone posted provides us with more insight. All and all, this is not book Sansa and I see that even the attempts of comparing those two storylines is simply wrong. Subtleties were never their forte, but this, this is just bad...
Â 
And will someone explain me WTF is so difficult in adapting "Only Cat"? I mean, one of the most memorable lines ever in ASOIAF... Who does that? What adaptation defile the books like this? Simply, it is idiotic and counter-productive.
Â 
Â 


They basically need TWOW material now to advance Sansa`s story. Unless the want to show Littlefinger trying to make out with her for an entire season.


Â 
Yeah... I mean, not only hers. Brienne's arc is also on verge of ending... Next season will be most interesting to see how things resolve.
4097	Darkbringer	2014-05-19	The first part of her walking out into the courtyard was well acted and choreographed, but the rest felt awkward, and yes, leaving out "only Cat" was a travesty.
4098	Chebyshov	2014-05-19	I think the kiss was framed poorly, but it was clear she wasn't reciprocating (and reiterated later when she talked to Lysa). And I oddly liked the SR slap; I think the doll through this medium may have made Sansa look a bit bratty, without us being privy to her thoughts.
Â 
I guess Sansa will spend part of next season piecing together Jon Arryn's death? Seems like it's good knowledge for her to have.
Â 
As to "Only Cat," here's one theory on why they changed the line:Â http://www.vanityfai...=social_twitter
4099	Hoo	2014-05-19	I don't see why Sansa would turn on Balish. Â He saved her from the KL, and saved her from Lysa, and he loved her mother. Â Sansa really only has positive experience with Balish. Â I think they are tied up as partners.
4100	OnlyOne	2014-05-19	Â 
i wouldn't say vengeful killer person but there's no doubt that sansa's being set up to kill. tyrion's line about her not being a killer yet, slapping robin when she was angry with him and smiling when she hears littlefinger explain that you hurt people who hurt you or your loved ones. plus, she's far more aggressive with littlefinger than she ever was in the book. this is the second time she's demanded something from him.

Now everybody is catching on....LF is doomed.
4101	juanml82	2014-05-19	I don't see why Sansa would turn on Balish. Â He saved her from the KL, and saved her from Lysa, and he loved her mother. Â Sansa really only has positive experience with Balish. Â I think they are tied up as partners.I think it depends on Sansa  finding out -or not - that LF betrayed Ned in season 1
4102	Chebyshov	2014-05-19	I think it depends on Sansa finding out -or not - that LF betrayed Ned in season 1


Â 
Plus I don't think she's on-board with the poisoning of SR. We'll see how they change that in the show given SR's heartiness, but Sansa knows LF isn't a good or trustworthy man. Plus the creep factor.
4103	Cas Stark	2014-05-19	Am I right that show Sansa doesn't know that her aunt poisoned her husband? Â She wasn't there in the scene between Lysa and LF, and last night all she says is she killed for him?
Â 
Interesting change, it could be mean nothing or could mean that Book Sansa will never do anything with this information that matters.
4104	Empress In The North	2014-05-19	I don't like her at all.Â 
Â 
She has done nothing, the most passive character in the history of characters.Â 
Â 
Her only "thing" is being a Stark.Â 


Â 
Nope. Nope. Not going to do it.
4105	Fey	2014-05-19	Don't know which thread to put this in, but I suppose I'll put it here.
Â 
Didn't like the scene at all, from the beginning of the snow castle scene to the end with Lysa's death. I knew it would be hard to portray how important the castle meant to her, but it still disappointed me that they didn't. Short and rushed. Robin trying to be kind towards Sansa, and her snapping at him for accidentally breaking a part of the castle felt extremely bratty of her, especially since viewers don't know how she's supposed to have worked on it for hours and how much thought and effort were put into it.
Â 
Lysa's death scene felt incredibly rushed and not intense at all like in the book. And I find it interesting/odd that they didn't have Lysa repeat that she killed her husband, since Sansa now doesn't know this fact and, if she ever finds out, it would have to be from LF (assuming it's important that Sansa knows that LF had Lysa murder her own husband)
4106	Elba the Intoner	2014-05-19	Props for the Frozen link!Â  I too immediately thought of Sansa in her snow castle as soon as I heard "Let It Go".Â  That is Sansa's new anthem for me.
Â 
As for the big scene, sadly I too found it was underwhelming and rushed.Â  I don't know why they put the reveal about Lysa killing Jon Arryn and blaming it on the Lannisters a few episodes back in a murmer between her and Petyr.Â  It was much more shocking in the books and there was such a built up of rising craziness in which Lysa completely breaks with reality and starts addressing Sansa as if she is Cat in the books that would have been really powerful to show.Â  I do think Kate Dickey did a great job with what she was given though.Â  I am as perplexed as everyone else as to who they are going to explain Lysa's death now.Â  I am really, really trying not to be a critical book purist, I liked that they reintroduced Hot Pie for example, and I get that you can't show internal monologue the same way in a visual medium, but I just don't get why they are making some of the changes that would be great TV.Â  "Only Cat" was a much more powerful statement.Â  And Sansa needs to know that information herself.Â 
Â 
I am also going to bring up the Hound's scene here because it relates to Sansa.Â  I liked his monologue and I love Rory's portrayal of the Hound but would it have killed the writers to have him mention Sansa here?Â  If the running theme of this ep was all about sibling relationships as the article in the link someone posted above suggests, then why not have the conversation about when he asks Arya if she had a brother she wanted to kill, or perhaps a sister?Â  That was the perfect place for it.
4107	Oberoth	2014-05-19	Robin wanted to show sansa the moon door, but he was over excited. He was about to slip when lysa tossed him back and saved him. Unfortunately she fell instead.
Â 
Not sure how they will actually explain the push/fall. I did miss the "Only Cat" line.
4108	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-19	For some reason, they really seem to emphasizing on Robin pushing "something" out the moondoor. Whether it was the "gift" from Petyr in episode 5 or him telling Sansa that he could let someone fly. Now the eyrie set has been torn down and in the books, they have descended to the gates of the moon, but still weird that they emphasized it twice.
Â 
ETA: Moon tea was not mentioned. Not important then?

4109	juanml82	2014-05-19	ETA: Moon tea was not mentioned. Not important then?

Well, I think it's vital to understand Book!Lysa motivations and her sad backstory. I'm not sure Show!Lysa motivations aren't clear though: she didn't help Robb because she was very jealous and upset at her sister, had been madly in love with LF all her life and she struggled to finally marry him despite all opposition.
4110	Chebyshov	2014-05-19	ETA: Moon tea was not mentioned. Not important then?


Â 
I had the same thought. Then again it could be a detail or minor plot that just won't make it into the show.
4111	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-19	So, I re-watched the scene (much to my chagrin), and I'm thinking that the reason they kissed so long was so that the camera could pan out to Lysa watching. I think they were trying to set up an "Oh shit" moment when the audience saw that Lysa was watching them, so basically, the directing was, "Kiss and hold". That theory still doesn't change the fact that the scene--as a whole--was terribly rushed and underwhelming, but I'm thinking that at least explains the long kiss part.
4112	howardh51	2014-05-19	I think this is another example of the show overtaking the book(s)...
Â 
To me it reads as if - when we catch up to Sansa and LF in WOW - they will be more partners and the show needed to ummm, show this, to move the story forward for next season when we get into WOW territory...
4113	RoamingRonin	2014-05-19	I liked the snow castle scene a lot. I like Robin a lot more on the show than the books (did the kid age at all in real life?). The snow scene had great pacing but the Lysa-Sansa-LF scene? Not so much. It felt rushed, didn't have suspense. I burst out laughing at "Your sister". Â Sophie Turner is not just tall but full-bodied as well. There's something amazonian (you mad OP? lol) about her. Why didn't she just pick up Aunt Lysa and slam dunk her through the moon door. 
Â 
The Vale scenes were good TV but as a reader I would have liked something more in line with the books.Â 
Â 
LF and Sansa might tell "the truth" about what happened: Lysa attacked her and LF saved her.Â
4114	Gogossos	2014-05-19	The Sansa scenes in this episode sums up the challenges, the mistakes and what they sometimes get right, about adapting the books. It started brilliantly and Sansa looked radiant in the snow, as she should. The building of the snow castle was skipped and SR's and LF's interjections were switched around. The reason for that, I guess, was to carry the momentum to Lysa's scene, so maybe it's understandable. Slapping Robin felt fine and oddly the kissing scene, whilst it wasn't exactly spot on, it wasn't wrong either. Perhaps a bit longer than it should but Sansa didn't consent, she didn't strongly push him back either - curtesy as armour. The mistakes, I feel, started at Lysa's scene. Couldn't they have invested another two minutes to allow Lysa to rant and rave, going madder by the second? I know that they put the Jon Arryn poisoning confession a few episodes earlier, so they couldn't really put it here again but even without it the main thrust of the rant could've come across. Cat once kissed and teased LF and it was Lysa who snuck into his room, gave up her virginity to him and even fell pregnant before it was terminated by Hoster. She's always loved and is devoted to Petyr, and Sansa's kiss was just a reminder of what Cat once did to him and it pushed her over the edge.
And it was that rage as she dragged Sansa that convinces LF that Lysa's time was over. So while cutting out the moment when Sansa got lost in her Winterfell memories was probably a good filming decision, I think shortening Lysa's rant is the reason why the scene lacked a bit of punch (to readers anyway) as well as the decision to change an iconic line and for that there's no excuse. Maybe it's D&D's ego taking over, maybe they thought it wasn't clear (which is a result of them condensing Lysa's rant), quite possibly maybe they weren't aware of how iconic that line was. Â

4115	Hoo	2014-05-19	I'm not really clear what to make of the repeated scenes of Sansa insisting on Littlefinger's "real" motivation, because what he told her back in episode 4 was far closer to the truth than what he says here (unless what he said was supposed to be true, but I really can't imagine that, because it makes no sense).Â  So we're not seeing a progression of uncovering the truth, though Sansa may think that's what she's doing; but it's presented in such a way that I suspect casual viewers might buy it, because it resembles a progression.


Â 
This. Â A really good point. I have no idea why Sansa asked Balish again to give her the real reason for killing Joffrey. Â The sound reason was given when they were sailing for Vale, the boy was unstable. Â  In this episode Balish tells Sansa it was because Joff killed Cat, as the real reason. Â But would Balish then not kill Tywin? Â Seems like an inconsistent plot tool to get to the kiss and killing of Lysa.
Â 
Â 
*Confused*
4116	Woman of War	2014-05-19	Sansa's lie about Marillion's guilt has been left out, obviously, since there was no Marillion or any other character to be accused falsely of having killed Lysa.   Sansa does not have a part in Marillion's death by lying! Oh-oh, serious whitewashing here, character assassination, St. Sansa the showmakers' favorite pet!!!! 
But with the rather consensual kiss and the different approach between Baelish and Sansa the showmakers will probaly walk the path of making Sansa and LF more partners in crime in the future than it was hinted at in the books.
4117	Le Cygne	2014-05-19	I am also going to bring up the Hound's scene here because it relates to Sansa.Â  I liked his monologue and I love Rory's portrayal of the Hound but would it have killed the writers to have him mention Sansa here?Â  If the running theme of this ep was all about sibling relationships as the article in the link someone posted above suggests, then why not have the conversation about when he asks Arya if she had a brother she wanted to kill, or perhaps a sister?Â  That was the perfect place for it.Good point, Elba! Praise for the actors, but the writers don't have a feel for these stories.Looking at the two scenes side by side, when Sandor hit Arya, and when Sansa hit Sweetrobin, that was filmed the same way. I'd imagine there will be a moment when Sansa and Sweetrobin come together next, like Sandor and Arya did. I guess there's some meaning there (perhaps they are the parent figures in the absence of Ned and Catelyn), but I'd rather they hadn't gone there. Words are more effective than slaps, to my thinking.

I agree that vengeance required the death of Tywin, not Joffrey who, for all his faults, had nothing to do with the RW. I guess LF thought process is "Damn! She didn't believe me when I told her the truth... sigh... I'll just lie to her. I'll end up taking her to my bed that way. Maybe I'll steal a kiss today and see what happens"

4119	Newstar	2014-05-19	I don't think striking a smaller, younger, weaker child (not that TV Sweetrobin seems like a weak child, but TV Sansa is clearly much stronger than he is) is something Book Sansa would do. I don't think it's ZOMG character assassination or anything, but it just doesn't fit with my image of Sansa, who even at her most incensed only took out her anger on Sweetrobin's doll. It's not that I think she wouldn't have the impulse--in AFFC when Sweetrobin is being trying she thinks how she'd like to give him slaps--but acting on it?
I'm kind of puzzled by the Hound's lack of references to Sansa, particularly given how many conversations the Hound and Arya have been having. It's not that there have been none (the Hound mentioned saving Sansa during the riot), but it almost seemed in the books as if he wouldn't shut up about her.
Rorge and Biter's deaths (meaning no clash with Brienne and no rape of Saltpans), with Brienne burning through her AFFC storyline (meaning a possible early meeting with Stoneheart), really make me wonder about whether the Hound will die for real on the show. I scoffed at the idea before, but I am really starting to wonder.
On another note, we're still missing that shot from the Season 4 trailer of Sansa stalking through a hallway, looking angry.

4121	Ser Not Appearing	2014-05-19	I haven't read many of these so I'm not sure how people feel about her progression overall but in this episode:
Pretty hard to capture the emotion of the book snow castle scene so I guess I'm not surprised they barely tried. I thought they made her look like the person in the wrong when she slapped Robyn which was... interesting.
Overall, I feel she is (in the show) coming off as somewhat more intrigued and not put off by Littlefinger's interest than she should be.
That's all I've got.

4122	avernite	2014-05-19	LF is sneaking in that he loves Sansa - and Joffrey has definitely done things to hurt Sansa.
Â 
So, 'what do I do to those who hurt you? I poison the cruel creeps'. Not the greatest pick-up line ever, but it fit LF's character, no?

Sansa is supposed to have been "shocked" by the kiss, per the BTS video.Â  I was wondering how the Unsullied would take that scene because it was less forceful than in the book, but there doesn't seem to be many people who thought it was mutual, so it seems more like something that only book readers were wondering about.

I'm an unsullied. Â I took the scene as a surprise kiss. Â From previous episodes, Sansa does not have an inkling that Balish is attracted to her. Â She believes him to view her as Â a "stupid little girl" who should keep her mouth shut. Â However, Sansa did not appear to resist the kiss, and even if surprised, she welcomed the kiss in a way. Â (Now, it may seem so because she is taller than Balish and had to lower her head for the kiss, but I do not believe it was just a matter of the mechanics.)
All this, and their relationship, makes me believe they are tied up in a partnership, but the previews hint Sansa may tell on Balish at the vale hearing.
4125	Tyrion's Third Wife	2014-05-19	I've only skimmed the Sansa threads, and admire the amazing amount of thought, study and insight that goes on with the Sansa fans, but I posted here just to say OH THANKS OP, I finally got that dang Frozen song out of my head and now it will be torturing me for days.
Â 
I hope you're happy.

4126	juanml82	2014-05-19	I haven't read many of these so I'm not sure how people feel about her progression overall but in this episode:
Pretty hard to capture the emotion of the book snow castle scene so I guess I'm surprised they barely tried. I thought they made her look like the person in the wrong when she slapped Robyn which was... interesting.
Overall, I feel she is (in the show) coming off as somewhat more intrigued and not put off by Littlefinger's interest than she should be.
That's all I've got.

I don't see why slapping Robin is wrong. Even if they don't show it, building that snow castle takes time and effort and the spoiled brat was destroying it with barely a reason. So Sansa finally snapped and did what his mother should have done so long ago.
Â 
I do agree about your perception of the rest of the snow castle scene, though. I don't know. Maybe any sort of reference to her internal monologue would seem over the top, but the previous conversation between Oberyn and Tyrion can be seen that way - and it's a character just narrating a flashback, which Sansa could have done. Among other things, I guess the thing that's most missed is that, in Sansa's head, snow means childhood and home.
Â

Well, "shocked" doesn't seem she didn't approve. Beside, if they need to explain things in a BTS video, they are doing it wrong. Movies and TV shows don't come with subtitles telling all the excuses of things that should be there but they aren't. They are to be judged by whatever comes out of the screen and speakers. I think we should all remember that Sansa, both TV and books versions, haven't read the books and don't have the same feelings for the characters that readers have.

4127	MarieAntoinette	2014-05-19	I wonder in which direction they are going with LF and Sansa. I do think that Sansa had a confused facial expression after the kiss, it did not appear like she gave consent, more like that she was too startled to react.. I even wonder if it was affection or infatuation of LF's part. -Right after the kiss he did not appear smitten, but had quite a cold and calculating stare.Â
4128	Petyr Patter	2014-05-19	In the book, doesn't Sansa think she's about to be raped a la Marillion when Littlefinger kisses her?
Â 
Even if the kiss itself lingered to long, we needed to see Sansa protest strongly after the fact.Â  "Why'd you do that?"Â  "You can't kiss me!" "Lysa will kill us!"
4129	Angmar	2014-05-19	Bleh at Frozen and suggesting Sansa is at the level of those shallow characters. Â 
Â 
I overall liked the scene, but I did feel it was quite rushed at the start. It could've been nice had the beginning with the snow yard been a bit slower, more "whimsical" in nature, like Sansa suddenly enter into her own Narnia or Wonderland. Show her playing a bit more with the snow, etc.
Â 
Could have been nice for the scene to have a more "nostalgic" feel to it, and for the snow castle to take its time to build. SR was okay but I never pictured Sansa slapping little kids- she's more of a nurturer in that regard. She strikes me as the type of caretaker who would make deals with the kids for them to listen to her.
Â 
The kiss was strange. in b4 tumblr attacks again with "RAEP CUTLRUEW!!!"
4130	OnlyOne	2014-05-19	Sansa won't betray LF yet although I do believe she will kill him...eventually and in that moment, Sansa will no longer be stupid.
4131	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-05-19	I was very disappointed with the snow castle scene. Â I was expecting her to be more emotional about it. Â Also most "unsullied" viewers seemed to think she enjoyed the kiss, which is very different than what happened in the book.
4132	Hoo	2014-05-19	Is Sansa starting to play games as she matures? Â 
Sansa was grilled by Lysa about Sansa's relationship with Balish, to the question of whether Sansa was pregnant by Balish. Â Lysa was powerful and disturbed in that scene so much that Lysa made Sansa cry. Â In this episode Sansa kisses Balish. Â Then, when confronted by Lysa, the first thought of guilt that comes to her mind is that she hurt Robin. Â 
Â 
Is Sansa still an immature child? Â Is she starting to connive?

She didn't see Lysa. So she has reasons to believe Robin told her about the slap, but no reason to believe Lysa saw them. Also, it's Baelish who started the kiss, not Sansa. Sansa just took her sweet time before pushing him back.
4134	Peachie	2014-05-19	-Right after the kiss he did not appear smitten, but had quite a cold and calculating stare.Â 


Â 
I can see that but it also seemed like he was "putting his Littlefinger mask back on" in a way. He'd let his guard down and reacted to seeing Sansa in the snow (as we hear from GRRM in the post-ep video) , to her interaction with SR and after she pulls back he realizes that he needs to put his walls up again.Â

Correction. Baelish kissed Sansa. He basically "stole" that kiss by surprise.
4136	The Fenris Wolf	2014-05-19	LOL I always get a kick out of this forum. Â I've read the books multiple times, and have been a faithful watcher of the show from the beginning, and I just don't get the incredible butthurt over this scene. Â It seems that every single episode there is some irrelevant bit that they change that all the fans just completely lose their shit over. Â "OMG HE DIDN'T SAY ONLY CAT!!" Â So what? Â Good lord.
Â 
And one of you actually mentioned that this scene, this ONE SCENE, is the only thing that in your opinion makes the entire series worthwhile. Â I just don't get it. Â Here are the fundamentals of what is by all accounts a fairly standard GRRM murder scene:
Â 
1. Sansa stands in snow
2. Sansa builds Winterfell
3. Robin wrecks it
4. Littlefinger helps her rebuild it
5. They kiss
6. Lysa sees the kiss, goes apeshit
7. Littlefinger pushes her out the moon door, blames it on fop
Â 
I've read these books so many times and this particular scene never struck me as any kind of lynchpin. Â I mean there are so many massive scenes that they altered or just didn't do at all, that to fixate on this one strikes me as almost pathological.
4137	Fey	2014-05-19	I'm very curious about Sansa's future after this episode. Even if this episode, I got an inkling of Sansa turning darker, what with the slap, demanding LF to tell her why she had Joffrey killed, and the slightly mischievous grin on her face when LF gives his "explanation". Plus there's the preview for episode 8, where it seems like Sansa's going to lie on LF's behalf in front of everyone. Lots of set up. Can't wait to see what they do with her next season.
4138	Jojosh	2014-05-19	and now the show has launched anew the sansa/littlefinger ship something serious. I mean sophie closes her eyes and leans into the kiss and everything.
I keep forgetting this is faux grown sansa and she's no longer little bird book sansa

And what's the point? Â It's a badass line that he threw away while killing someone. Â So what? Â Is this seriously ruining your enjoyment of the entire episode? Â You could have offered me a thousand dollars and I wouldn't have been able to tell you what Baelish said when pushing her out the Moon Door. Â Why obsess over this one line? Â Why not over the fact that the Moon Door is in the floor and not in the wall, like in the books? Â That's just as bloody random.
Â 
One of my favorite lines from the books is when the Hound kills Polliver at the Inn at the Crossroads. Â I don't know why, I just think it's epic and badass.
Â 
"If you want me, come get me." Sandor pushed away from the wall and stood in a half-crouch behind the bench, his sword held across his body.
Â 
"You think we won't?" said Polliver. "You're drunk."
Â 
"Might be," said the Hound, "but you're dead."
Â 
That is awesome. Â Short lines, would have taken mere seconds on the show, but they didn't do it. Â Why not? Â I don't know, and don't particularly care.
Â 
My question is: why this scene? Â It is a moderately important scene, but no more than a thousand others over the course of this series. Â Why the obsession? Â As I said in my first comment, it reaches the level of pathology.

4142	Kingpin	2014-05-19	Â 
Nope. Nope. Not going to do it.


Â 
I don't know what she "pulled off" in the book, but in the show it's as I said it.Â

You know it's true!

Could there be some sort of disconnect here between what was intended and what came across to the viewer through acting/directing, a la Jaime/Cersei rape scene earlier in the season? Because if the showrunners intended Sansa's reaction to be one of horror or disgust, or even shock and confusion, I gotta say, having Sophie Turner close her eyes in a relaxed way--not screwed shut, but relaxed--and lean into the kiss was not the way to accomplish it. I just watched How to Steal a Million, and the first kiss between the two leads reminded me of the LF/Sansa kiss as filmed: a forced kiss to start off with, but the female lead's body language softened, her eyes closed, and she leaned into the kiss as a shorthand for conveying the attraction she was feeling. Now, there's no way of knowing if that's what the writers/actors were trying to signal in that scene, but if they were going for something else, I'd say they screwed up.
4144	Lothar	2014-05-19	I do agree about your perception of the rest of the snow castle scene, though. I don't know.

Â 


Â 
All that would be needed to capture how she is feeling about Winterfell is the dialogue from the books.
Â 
Â 

â<U+0080><U+009C>That will give it strength enough to stand, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d think,â<U+0080><U+009D> Petyr said. â<U+0080><U+009C>May I come into your castle, my lady?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Sansa was wary. â<U+0080><U+009C>Donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t break it. Be . . .â<U+0080><U+009C>. . gentle?â<U+0080><U+009D> He smiled. â<U+0080><U+009C>Winterfell has withstood flercer enemies than me. It is Winterfell, is it not?â<U+0080><U+009D>â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes,â<U+0080><U+009D> Sansa admitted.He walked along outside the walls. â<U+0080><U+009C>I used to dream of it, in those years after Cat went north with Eddard Stark. In my dreams it was ever a dark place, and cold.â<U+0080><U+009D>â<U+0080><U+009C>No. It was always warm, even when it snowed. Water from the hot springs is piped through the walls to warm them, and inside the glass gardens it was always like the hottest day of summer.â<U+0080><U+009D>

Â 
It's pretty damn lousy that they skipped the building of the snow castle - my personal favorite Sansa scene in all of the books. Â Certainly one of the most emotional. Â It would have been so easy to keep that emotion too. Â Just keep playing the Winterfell music and show short clips of her building it. Â Everyone would have understood. Â Have her become frustrated at not being able to get the castle right - which would show how badly she misses it that it has to be absolutely perfect. Â It could have been heart wrenching for the TV audience. Â But no, instead of that, let's have bland dialogue between Milasandre and Selyse, a pointless Jon scene, two pointless Dany scenes, and a boring Brienne scene.

My anger has little to do with the "only cat" line. I'm worked up about Sansa's treatment of pedofinger, and the lack of emphasis on the snow castle. The scene was so friggin short that they couldn't fit the whole song. Sad. And then people like you state that it is 'inaignificabt.' Forgive me, but this may very well be the most important part of Sansa's arc to date and D&D treated it like background music.
4146	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-05-19	I'm glad I'm not the only one who is upset by how those two clowns handled the snow castle scene.
4147	ugashep	2014-05-19	Perhaps the reason Sansa did not appear to rebuff Littlefinger as much as many hoped is that she ultimately has a consensual love affair with him. It's not popular but its been suspected by some. SansaÂ going all in physically, emotionally, and politicallyÂ with Littlefinger might be the "controversial" with some portions of the fandomÂ development that we have been told about from TWOW. Everyone expects her to go from pawn to player but I cannot get over the fact that her wolf is dead. That has to be significant, she may be the Tully he would have had in a world were love overcomes strength and duty. D&D know the end game for her. Maybe the reason their development is so unsatisfying to Sansa fans is that its not the development they so hope for.

I don't think you're right at all. Look at Arya this season - She has little in common with book!Arya at this point, which is pretty much a traumatized girl that stabs a man a hundred times whilst crying. Or Cersei's development, or Tyrion's. Sometimes they simply change characterization because they want to, not for some ulterior motive. As to Sansa being a Tully, she's really more Ned, which could possibly mean she's really more Jon Arryn, by association.
Â 
On-topic: I guess I had expected too much out of this scene, and It felt rushed and not ressonating with it's book counterpart. I love the melancholic vibe of it, and the show didn't even seemed to try. It was like going through the motions as fast as It could.

No. Wrong tense. Sansa, as of the moment at the end of AFFC has no love affair, or nowhere near it,not even light years away. Perhaps one day they will have it, which I sincerely doubt, but as of this moment, it is silly to discuss the ongoing "love affair" between LF and Sansa.
4151	Alayne Stone	2014-05-19	I've rewatched the scene and don't get where the consensual impression is coming from. True, she didn't go 21st century power female and punch him or scream about respecting her gender identity. Everything in her demeanor is of being scared and, moreso, trapped. Look at the way he holds her head. Who kisses like that? It's a trap, not an embrace. And a trap from someone she had little reason to believe wasn't her protector. 
I'm at a loss - did they give Petyr his clean hands line?  I don't remember it and I miss it, especially as context to this scene.
4152	Martin Lasarte	2014-05-19	Petyr's expression after kissing her seems kind of frustrated. Like he was expecting her to be more enthusiastic, and she didn't respond as he wanted. That's what leads me to believe it wasn't consentual.

Then they need to quickly take a 101 Course of Portraying Non Consensual Sexual Acts on TV
4154	Newstar	2014-05-19	Look at the way he holds her head. Who kisses like that?
Â 
Joffrey, when kissing Sansa in Season 1, although Joffrey doesn't grip her head the whole time with both hands. Going back, the scene was shot similarly to Petyr and Sansa's kiss--shot from the side with Sansa on the left--as well. An intentional callback? It's the only other kiss Sansa's had in the series.
Â 
Â 
Â 
No, the scene was just badly shot. Â I think I read somewhere this morning that the writers of the tv show confirmed Sansa wasn't into it.
Â 
The "Inside the Episode" talking heads segment with D&D stated that the kiss "shocks" Sansa, which is a...curiously neutral way of putting it.

Â 
To be fair to ugashep, I think what was meant in that post by Sansa "ultimately having" a love affair with was that Sansa and LF might ultimately have a love affair in future books, not that they're currently having one...although I have to admit it's a little funny to state that LF and Sansa are "light years" away from a love affair, given that they've already made out in the books and Sansa's reaction to doing so was very ambiguous. Pod and Missandei are light years away from a love affair. Sam and Arianne are light years away from a love affair. LF and Sansa? It might be a ways off, and it indeed might never happen, but "light years" is overstating it a tad.
Â 
Â 
Â 
D&D know the end game for her. Maybe the reason their development is so unsatisfying to Sansa fans is that its not the development they so hope for.
Â 
Â 
I don't think you're right at all. Look at Arya this season - She has little in common with book!Arya at this point, which is pretty much a traumatized girl that stabs a man a hundred times whilst crying.
Â 
Except that Arya's characterization in Season 4 as a hardened, cold-blooded killer who slowly executes a man without a hint of remorse is entirely consistent with where the character is headed in the books as of the end of ADWD, even more so when you consider (big spoilers for TWOW)
Â 

	Spoiler that the manner in which she kills Polliver in 4x01 mimics the way she kills Raff in the Mercy chapter of TWOW, right down to reciting the words

The example of Arya goes against your point, since her characterization this season resonates very strongly with how she behaves in AFFC and ADWD, as a merciless killer many have argued to be an irredeemable sociopath. So if the same holds true for Sansa, then her behaviour in this season may very well be indicative of where she's headed as a character in future books, as opposed to reflecting writerly capriciousness on the part of D&D. Remember that this is the first season that they wrote after they got the huge, detailed rundown from GRRM as to all the characters' future plot arcs. The way they're writing Sansa this season may well be reflective of the knowledge that GRRM only laid on them in 2013. They certainly seem to be speeding through her ASOS and even now her AFFC material with great haste...maybe to get to some really juicy stuff post-ADWD?

4155	Another Locust	2014-05-19	I don't think you're right at all. Look at Arya this season - She has little in common with book!Arya at this point, which is pretty much a traumatized girl that stabs a man a hundred times whilst crying. Or Cersei's development, or Tyrion's. Sometimes they simply change characterization because they want to, not for some ulterior motive. As to Sansa being a Tully, she's really more Ned, which could possibly mean she's really more Jon Arryn, by association.
Â 
On-topic: I guess I had expected too much out of this scene, and It felt rushed and not ressonating with it's book counterpart. I love the melancholic vibe of it, and the show didn't even seemed to try. It was like going through the motions as fast as It could.


I agree that Sansa is more like Ned. The most similar trait with her mother that I can think of is appearance, and we all know how relevant that is. It would seem that D&D care more about Melisandre's productive conversation with Selyse than they do with one of the most poetic and symbolic chapters in the entire series. I consider it the turning point in Sansa's storyline, and they didn't even bother to hint at it in the episode's description. Irritating. They do a diservice to Sansa. I understand that it makes it more 'graspable' for the unsullied, but for the love of science, just have a little more substance with situations of relevance. Everything about it seemed kind of 'off.' Maybe the camera angles were off, but I didn't get the same connection that I did with GRRM's descriptions in ASoS.
4156	Newstar	2014-05-19	On rewatching Sansa and Sweetrobin's scenes in 4x07, Sweetrobin's voice is awfully, uh, deep. As others have pointed out, as tall and as physically imposing as Sophie Turner is, a mother/son vibe is going to be a hard sell. If anything, Sweetrobin seems more like a younger version of Joffrey at the start of the series: not in the sense of being a psychopath, but in the sense of trying to impress Sansa the way Joffrey once did (promising to toss anyone she doesn't like out the Moon Door).
Â 
I also wonder as others have if Sweetrobin will weaken visibly in Littlefinger's "care" over the next several episodes, and if that's the reason for his apparent robust health in 4x07. He might be hale and hearty now so that the deterioration in his condition is more obvious to the TV audience.

I truly believe that Sansa is one of the characters the show creators and writers don't understand too well and don't really want to use more than they have to. Â (Stannis and Brienne are others, and there are more I could name) Â The snow castle scene was nice, Sophie Turner as Sansa looked beautiful, but there was very little of the deep emotions she experienced in the book, and the kiss does not seem as unwelcome as it truly was. Â  Â  
Â 
There were several moments that could have been cut to expand that scene. Â Did we really need more footage of Selyse's insecurities, or the 60 seconds or whatever of Hot Pie's bringing forth the Direwolf Pastry? Â I'm convinced that Melisandre was lounging in the bath to satisfy HBO's Game of Thrones Nekkid Women quota. Â Or another round of 'You know nothing, Jon Snow' (only this time they were right, but at least there was a shot of Ghost)? Â The snow castle scene is an important moment in Sansa's development, and it was rushed and muted, and totally eclipsed by Littlefinger's kiss. Â (he should have been shown insinuating himself into her good graces, or trying to, by helping her build the castle after Robin's assault).
Â 
I certainly hope Sansa does not eventually have a consensual affair with LF. Â Ick. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â

The young actor is 13 now; and, listening to him, I felt he was struggling to keep his voice childish. Â He's definitely too old for TV-Sansa to be his mother-substitute; and the dialogue reflects that when the boy promises to make her enemies "fly" when they're married.
4160	Newstar	2014-05-19	Given the crazy amount they've streamlined Sansa's story, I predict they're going to cut out Harry the Heir.


Â 
I'm getting kind of excited about the speed of Sansa's storyline in Season 4, because I hope that it means that Sansa's storyline blows up post-ADWD into something really huge, and that they're flying through Sansa's ASOS/AFFC material to give themselves as much space possible in the show to cover it (bearing in mind that D&D have been batting around the seven seasons number for a while). However, it could just be that the writers are whipping through Sansa's remaining published chapters for some other reason, or that they're planning some Qarth-type filler arc. I know a lot of fans were really excited about Sansa going off on her own arc in the Vale and no longer being a glorified prop for Lannister-centric scenes, but their patience has been rewarded with the show tearing through Sansa's chapters at warp speed.
Â 
As for Harry the Heir, I could see them eliminating him entirely for economy. We still don't know how important he is in the books--red herring? Sansa's endgame husband?--but really, even if he is important in the books in some way, D&D might still write him out regardless. GRRM warned D&D against writing out Willas and Garlan because of their importance in future books, and D&D went ahead and did it anyway.

Â 
Yes and yes. I dunno. I should have seen this coming, as Sweetrobin's actor was not all that young even in Season 1, and that was filmed back in 2010, but eliminating the mother/son angle to Sansa and Sweetrobin's relationship really diminishes it. No shade on Sweetrobin's actor--he's fine except for his age--but they really should have recast with someone younger for Sweetrobin's return in Season 4.

Going back, the scene was shot similarly to Petyr and Sansa's kiss--shot from the side with Sansa on the left--as well. An intentional callback? It's the only other kiss Sansa's had in the series.
I love this analysis.  The girl, inexperienced as she is, is very good at going along and sussing out the situation caused by men in politically and physically dominating situations.

Â 
To be fair, even though compared to previous seasons Season 4 seems packed with seemingly meaningful references and what looks like possible foreshadowing--White Walker baby scene, Melisandre's insistence on Shireen being brought along, Jojen's vision of his burning hand--it's hard to tell how much of it is driven by D&D's knowledge of future books and how much is just showrunner fuckery with no broader implications other than reflecting their own preferences. Is Stannis being downplayed in the show because D&D have some special knowledge that he's not all that important in the end result and won't live past TWOW, or do they just not care for the character and therefore can't be bothered to give him much attention? The same goes for Sansa. Are the showrunners burning through her ASOS/AFFC chapters because they know something truly epic and huge is coming up for her and they can't wait to get to it, or do they just not give a shit?
Â 
The other part of the equation is that while D&D might not "get" her arc, they at least know where it's going. I would like to think that that will inform the way that they write Sansa now, and that we can parse the way these big Sansa scenes are written for clues, but, well, they knew exactly where Shae's arc was going, too. They could just take her way off-book and then just "course correct" at the last possible moment to get her back in line with her book characterization/storyline (much like Shae had this loving, sisterly bond with Sansa but nonetheless sold her out at the trial just as she did in the books)...and we wouldn't know the difference unless post-ADWD books were released by that point.

Â  Â Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  


Well, we read the books. D&D read the books and talk with the authors. So I think they understand every character. They also understand they can't have successful TV show by trying to make carbon copies of the book characters. For instance, they didn't write Shae the way they did because they didn't understand her. GRRM could have shared all his opinions, backstories, notes and everything that doesn't make it to the final material. They felt that (re)creating her the way they did made for a better show.
I agree that there was very little of the emotions portrayed in the books. Either they didn't care (which isn't the same as not understanding the character), they chickened out or they felt it didn't made for good TV. Personally, I'm inclined to believe in the second one. D&D really, really, struggle with the characters internal emotions and conflicts. More often than not, those things are shown because the directors and the actors pull it off, but not because the show was designed to pull it off.
Â 
As for the kiss "not seeming as unwelcome as it truly was" I'd be very careful with those assertions. Show!Sansa and Book!Sansa are different characters and the dynamic between Sansa and Baelish is different in the books and the show. The end game should be similar and D&D might go along the same path, maybe with some simplifications, or they might want to reach it through a separate path. Whether that feels organic and natural or it feels like a retcon is something we'll see when the show reaches that point in the narrative.
Â 
And I'll also be really wary of pretending to understand a character better than the guys who had a lot of chats with the book's author (or the author himself). I think many Sansa fans will be in for a nasty surprise when TWOW is finally published, and Show!Sansa's reactions to Robin's idea of installing a Moon Door at Winterfell and LF's phrase about "what do we do to those who hurt the ones we love" "foreshadow" a lot more of even Book!Sansa's future than obscure references in the books which can be completely unintentional.

Â 
My sentiments/assumptions down to the T! I'm assuming she's incredibly important in the future, which is why they're rushing her storyline; because they need to get to that stuff quicker. And I think this because of the fact that not only will we potentially end the season having gone through all of her written chapters, but also, because her personality is different. She's much more forceful with Petyr and they've alluded to her "newfound" desire for vengeance and potential for killing (i.e. "She's not a killer...yet). I honestly think they're jumping right into who she ends up becoming---without taking the scenic route of the book. And if they're doing that, its got to be for a reason other then "they don't understand her character".
Â 
Also, I don't think Aiden or Sophie were "trolling" in all of these interviews. When Aiden talks about becoming partners with her and that her personality surprises him, I'm starting to think that wasn't wishful thinking, faint praise, or anything else. I think he's speaking from a place of knowing exactly what the hell's about to happen. Same with Sophie. When she says off the wall stuff that isn't happening right now (either in the show or books); or when she goes off on a tangent rage about being frustrated that people don't root for a feminine character with intelligence...I'm inclined to think she too is speaking from a place of knowing what's about to happen rather then what's happened up to this point.Â 
Â 
You know, I wouldn't be surprised if they flip the script and have Sansa tell Petyr HER plans. So, she saves his ass in this next episode and then in the finale she says something to the effect of, "I want Winterfell back. How do we do that?" And then hell, he'll say something to the effect of, 'Why stop at Winterfell when you can have the world," (i.e. "The world will be yours") and there you go! Partners in crime! (A scenario that would also make Aiden's comment about "not playing this relationship creepy", ring true).Â 
Â 
No matter how you slice and dice it though, I'm incredibly excited that they're rushing through her material because I'm more than a little intrigued about where her story will eventually end up.

Â  Â  
Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  

Â 
I agree, but it's a somewhat inevitable issue of aging the character up. In the ASOS appendix, she is 12. While I do think it's a little too hard to imagine the book Stark kids as young as they were described (and George has said that given the direction the narrative took, the youngest characters should have been introduced as a little older), a lot of things about Sansa make more sense for a girl who has just begun puberty in book 2.
Â 
It's easy for me to imagine a 12-14 year old building a snow castle, losing her temper when a little brat tears it down, but also feeling the obligation to be nurturing in the way where an older sibling has to take the role of a surrogate parent before she's really equipped to do so, and having a young teenager's mix of curiosity and repulsion of being kissed, both despite and because of not having a complete understanding of everything sex entails. When I see someone who looks like a young adult playing in the snow, slapping a child, and kissing a man, I have to actively tear down my assumption in the back of my thoughts that because she looks like a young adult, she has the knowledge and experience of a young adult. And by Westeros standards, there wouldn't be anything particularly ick about a man Littlefinger's age pursuing a 17 year old. Show Sansa would be an appropriate age to be getting married and running her own household. So on one hand, it's important to the character to have kept her in a state of relative naivety and innocence, but OTOH, if it's played up too much, it leaves the older looking character seeming not just naive but developmentally challenged and impossibly out of touch with reality, to give her the mindset of a 12 year old. So she's stuck in maturity limbo.
4168	voodooqueen126	2014-05-19	I have no problem with Sansa wanting justice for the people she loved. I think this is normal and natural. I also think if we forgive evil people, and let them run around, they will cause suffering to even more people. Justice is good and good people seek justice.
I am actually surprised by book Sansa's lack of rancor towards the Lannisters.

I'm willing to concede they understand her if that means they just didn't like her very much. Outcome is the same. My opinion is based mostly on three things: Sansa's blistering rebuke of the Septa in season 1 ("Oh, I forgot. I don't care."); the emmense popularity of Tyrion, Dany, Jon, Bronn, Oberyn, Arya, Jamie and any other character whose plots tend to get more threads and comments than a Sansa one; and the missing seven minutes at the end of last night's episode.
4170	Alayne Stone	2014-05-19	Random tangent: how far ahead do the actors get the scripts?  I know Sophie's read the books. I remember reading that Aiden hasn't. It may not be trolling so much as utter innocence.
4171	Newstar	2014-05-19	I'm willing to concede they understand her if that means they just didn't like her very much.
Â 
Eh, if they didn't like her, they would have included the most unflattering book Sansa scenes: Sansa going to Cersei in AGOT, Sansa telling Arya she should have died instead of Lady, etc. etc. They would not have included a scene where Joffrey apologizes to Sansa and promises to mend his ways, explaining why she trusts him again after his previous behaviour. They would have continued showing Sansa being rude and haughty with Shae throughout their relationship, instead of developing the sweet, sisterly bond that they did. They would have played up Sansa's hostility and iciness towards beloved hero Tyrion and her disgust at his dwarfism. They did not do any of these things. It would have been very easy for them to destroy viewer sympathy for TV Sansa simply by being faithful to the books, but the TV writers deliberately softened Sansa's actions and scrubbed her more controversial actions from the adaptation, something they wouldn't have bothered doing if they didn't like the character.
Â 
Â 
the emmense popularity of Tyrion, Dany, Jon, Bronn, Oberyn, Arya, Jamie and any other character whose plots tend to get more threads and comments than a Sansa one
Â 
It would be one thing if Sansa were the most popular character among the book reader fandom and was reviled by the TV viewer fandom, but that's hardly the case. If anything, Sansa is even less popular among book readers on average than show viewers, and that's thanks largely to things which didn't make it into the show, like Sansa going to Cersei in AGOT. If the adaptation were more faithful, I imagine TV Sansa would be even less popular than she currently is among TV viewers. Even if, however, the fandom in general isn't all that enamoured of Sansa, that doesn't mean that the TV writers necessarily feel the same way. Didn't Bryan Cogman say that Sansa's the character he most wants to give a hug?
Â 
All that's not to say that the writers like Sansa as much as Tyrion or Arya, because that's clearly not the case, or even that they necessarily care that much about her storyline, because they haven't seemed all that invested in her except in relation to the Lannisters (who do clearly interest the writers quite a bit), but I'm not seeing any evidence of dislike.
Â 
And really, so what if they don't like Sansa as much as Tyrion or Arya? GRRM vastly prefers Tyrion and Arya to Sansa, and it shows. If GRRM's entitled to that opinion, then surely the ones adapting his books are as well.

That scene is basically a replacement for Joffrey being nicer to Sansa in the tourney sequence, which they cut.
Â 
As far as whether this or that is foreshadowing, there's certainly foreshadowing suggestive of future plot points this season, which are usually underlined, but things like how the kiss was shot don't fall into that category for me (particularly in a season that brought us the huge writing/directing screwup with Jaime/Cersei). The show doesn't really make characterization foreshadowing on that subtle a level.
4173	Rapsie	2014-05-20	I do wish they had not cut so much of Sansa's arc (or Lysa's back story). They had the Crasters filler yet seem to rush every scene Sophie is in (like the deleted scene from season 2 where Sophie and Rory spend a minute and a half almost tripping over their lines to get them out, followed by a minute and a half shot of a sad looking Tyrion.)I hope not, but I suspect next season may include a Sansa filler storyline to some degree like Dany had in Season 2. They do seem to be increasingly replacing source scenes with their own invented ones. Like Stannis, Sansa seems to be a character they are not really interested in to the same extent as others.[quote name="juanml82" post="5803915" timestamp="1400556996"]Well, we read the books. D&D read the books and talk with the authors. So I think they understand every character. They also understand they can't have successful TV show by trying to make carbon copies of the book characters. For instance, they didn't write Shae the way they did because they didn't understand her. /quote]Cat Stark and the awful addition of Talisa would tend to refute that. Also Shae suddenly turning on Tyrion at the trial has confused a lot of unsullied because it is so against the characterisation they have done with her. While they may talk to the author that doesn't preclude the "wouldn't it be cool if" aspect of deviation or the dude bro nature of the producers. The addition of the Pod brothel scene or the babies in jars at Dragonstone for example. Indeed when you have guest directors weirded out by a producer demanding random naked women in a scene to appeal to the pervert side of the audience, that does not suggest character understanding as much as a guy who has never mentally matured beyond 15.They are doing what they think will be cool in the adaptation of the books, but that doesn't mean that it is the definitive way to do things or they are getting the right idea across to the viewer ( such as the Jaime raping Cersei scene that they thought they portrayed as consensual). Some filler they do well; the Brienne/Pod/Hotpie scene was lovely and very much in the spirit of the relationship between the two in the books. However other filler, does not work well.

Â It seems that every single episode there is some irrelevant bit that they change that all the fans just completely lose their shit over. Â "OMG HE DIDN'T SAY ONLY CAT!!" Â So what? Â Good lord.
Â 
And one of you actually mentioned that this scene, this ONE SCENE, is the only thing that in your opinion makes the entire series worthwhile. Â I just don't get it. Â Here are the fundamentals of what is by all accounts a fairly standard GRRM murder scene:
Â 
1. Sansa stands in snow
2. Sansa builds Winterfell
3. Robin wrecks it
4. Littlefinger helps her rebuild it
5. They kiss
6. Lysa sees the kiss, goes apeshit
7. Littlefinger pushes her out the moon door, blames it on fop
Â 
I've read these books so many times and this particular scene never struck me as any kind of lynchpin. Â I mean there are so many massive scenes that they altered or just didn't do at all, that to fixate on this one strikes me as almost pathological.


Â 
Â 
Most of the components are there, but I think if anything was a lynchpin in that scene in the books, it was Lysa revealing her secrets to Sansa (not the audience) - she murdered her husband and blamed the Lannisters, she kept the Vale out of the resulting war because she actually hated Catelyn over the whole Petyr issue. Up to that point, Lysa was portrayed as haughty and fearful, and she comes out as treacherous and utterly crazy. As well, it reveals that whatever we thought about Littlefinger up to that point, the reality is far worse. ASOS had many "holy shit" moments, and this was one of them.
4175	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-20	I'm really liking the way they're portraying Sansa in the show, with some more vengeance, I gotta admit.Â 
Â 
Â 


The fact that Sophie Turner could pass for 25 and towers over everyone sort of took away from Baelish's creeper moment
Â 
Â 


No, she definitely doesn't pass for 25 in the show, she's tall and very beautiful but she's also undeniably a child. The way she was speaking about winterfell, she sounded very young.Â
4176	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-20	Â 
Yes and yes. I dunno. I should have seen this coming, as Sweetrobin's actor was not all that young even in Season 1, and that was filmed back in 2010, but eliminating the mother/son angle to Sansa and Sweetrobin's relationship really diminishes it. No shade on Sweetrobin's actor--he's fine except for his age--but they really should have recast with someone younger for Sweetrobin's return in Season 4.


Everyone is older in the show. He's plenty young and irritating and Sansa can still be maternal towards him.Â
4177	Lothar	2014-05-20	Â 
It's easy for me to imagine a 12-14 year old building a snow castle, losing her temper when a little brat tears it down, but also feeling the obligation to be nurturing in the way where an older sibling has to take the role of a surrogate parent before she's really equipped to do so, and having a young teenager's mix of curiosity and repulsion of being kissed, both despite and because of not having a complete understanding of everything sex entails. When I see someone who looks like a young adult playing in the snow, slapping a child, and kissing a man, I have to actively tear down my assumption in the back of my thoughts that because she looks like a young adult, she has the knowledge and experience of a young adult. And by Westeros standards, there wouldn't be anything particularly ick about a man Littlefinger's age pursuing a 17 year old. Show Sansa would be an appropriate age to be getting married and running her own household.Â 


There's no way she's 17 in the show. Â She was 14 when she married Tyrion at the end of last season. Â It hasn't been 3 years since then. Â As far as we know, she's still a 14 year old building a snow castle. Â Well, not building, since they cut that part out.Â
4178	ladyinblack	2014-05-20	Sansa's lie about Marillion's guilt has been left out, obviously, since there was no Marillion or any other character to be accused falsely of having killed Lysa. Sansa does not have a part in Marillion's death by lying! Oh-oh, serious whitewashing here, character assassination, St. Sansa the showmakers' favorite pet!!!! 
But with the rather consensual kiss and the different approach between Baelish and Sansa the showmakers will probaly walk the path of making Sansa and LF more partners in crime in the future than it was hinted at in the books.


The Thronecast interview with Aiden certainly implies just that
4179	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-20	GRRM prefers Arya over Sansa? That's news to me. Sure, he outright said that his favorite character is Tyrion but Arya's popularity stems from the fans, who outnumber Sansa fans.Â

According to the GoT wiki she's supposed to be 15-16 in S4. They're not really explaining the flow of time well, but then again they said something about her being tortured by Joffrey for 2 years, so that kind of fits.
4181	The Last Conformist	2014-05-20	Â 
I'm getting kind of excited about the speed of Sansa's storyline in Season 4, because I hope that it means that Sansa's storyline blows up post-ADWD into something really huge, and that they're flying through Sansa's ASOS/AFFC material to give themselves as much space possible in the show to cover it (bearing in mind that D&D have been batting around the seven seasons number for a while). However, it could just be that the writers are whipping through Sansa's remaining published chapters for some other reason, or that they're planning some Qarth-type filler arc. I know a lot of fans were really excited about Sansa going off on her own arc in the Vale and no longer being a glorified prop for Lannister-centric scenes, but their patience has been rewarded with the show tearing through Sansa's chapters at warp speed.
Â 
As for Harry the Heir, I could see them eliminating him entirely for economy. We still don't know how important he is in the books--red herring? Sansa's endgame husband?--but really, even if he is important in the books in some way, D&D might still write him out regardless. GRRM warned D&D against writing out Willas and Garlan because of their importance in future books, and D&D went ahead and did it anyway.
Â

Â 
If Anya Waynwood is already cast (and she is), I don't see why Harry the Heir wouldn't appear next season. Frankly, it would be a bit strange to keep Lady Waynwood but cut out the only thing that makes her important (that she basically controls Harry the Heir).
Â 
We'll see. I think Harry the Heir will be mentioned in the meeting with the Lords Declarant next episode. They could have cut the Lords Declarant entirely (especially since Marillion is cut), but they didn't, which indicates to me that Sansa/the Vale's plotline will continue more or less as written.

Â 
I agree with this. If the reason we're so far in Sansa's material is because there's a lot coming up, that's incredibly exciting. If it's more of a "well we have a lot to cover next season" move, then I'll be disappointed.
Â 
As for Harry being cut, it's incredibly hard to predict with what we know of her arc so far. I think SR looking super healthy makes me more doubtful of Harry's appearance, but maybe they'll give SR a fit next week, or we'll hear Harry's name evoked. Kind of a jump-ball at the moment.
4183	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-20	IÂ wonder how they are going to portray Bronze Yohn Royce. We do not know for sure that he knows Sansa's identity but it is hinted in the books (and that is with the hair dye). Since he is going to appear, i really do wonder what's going to happen. Will he go "do i know you"?

Â 
GoT wiki is wrong, plain and simple. It's not really the most reliable source out there. Sansa can't be 16 unless there's been more than a year since her wedding to Tyrion (when she still hadn't turned 15), which would also mean about a year since the RW... which is obviously not the case. Someone got confused between the time that passes on the show and the time that passes in real life while we're watching the show. They also put Joffrey at 19 (?!), explaining it by a mention of him being 17 in season 2, and they obviously think that there's actually been two years between season 2 and season 4, like Kit when he said he had been beyond the Wall for two years (LOL).
Â 
It's not even consistent - whoever edited Dany's page put her age as 18 (?!), which is also obviously incorrect, since she was 17 in season 1, being about the same age as Robb and Jon, so she should be 19 now. And, of course, it's theoretically impossible for Joffrey to be older than Dany.

Â 
Yeah, the GoT wiki is definitely off, but so is the show's timeline. They say that Tommen was 8 in S1, and we are definitely not looking at a 10/11 year old king. You're right about Sansa's age at the wedding; IMO placing her nearish to 15 seems a safe choice. But the whole thing is entirely farcockt.
4186	Annara Snow	2014-05-20	Random tangent: how far ahead do the actors get the scripts? I know Sophie's read the books. I remember reading that Aiden hasn't. It may not be trolling so much as utter innocence.


Â 
He said that after filming scenes in which he's creeping on her including kissing her, so yeah, he was definitely trolling.
Â 
Sophie has only read her chapters, and she only reads them for the season she's working on. I don't know if it means that she had read just ASOS, or AFFC too before filming season 4, since they seem to already be including AFFC stuff like Lords Declarant and the aftermath of Lysa's death.
Â 
-----------
re: the kiss - the way the kiss itself was filmed isn't that different from how it is in the book; it's Sansa's reaction once she overcomes her shock and pulls away that's strong in the book:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>I told you that nothing could please me more than to help you with your castle. I fear that was a lie as well. Something else would please me more.â<U+0080><U+009D> He stepped closer. â<U+0080><U+009C>This.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Sansa tried to step back, but he pulled her into his arms and suddenly he was kissing her. Feebly, she tried to squirm, but only succeeded in pressing herself more tightly against him. His mouth was on hers, swallowing her words. He tasted of mint. For half a heartbeat she yielded to his kiss... before she turned her face away and wrenched free. â<U+0080><U+009C>What are you doing?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Petyr straightened his cloak. â<U+0080><U+009C>Kissing a snow maid.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re supposed to kiss her.â<U+0080><U+009D> Sansa glanced up at Lysaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s balcony, but it was empty now. â<U+0080><U+009C>Your lady wife.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>I do. Lysa has no cause for complaint.â<U+0080><U+009D> He smiled. â<U+0080><U+009C>I wish you could see yourself, my lady. You are so beautiful. Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re crusted over with snow like some little bear cub, but your face is flushed and you can scarcely breathe. How long have you been out here? You must be very cold. Let me warm you, Sansa. Take off those gloves, give me your hands.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>I wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t.â<U+0080><U+009D> He sounded almost like Marillion, the night heâ<U+0080><U+0099>d gotten so drunk at the wedding. Only this time Lothor Brune would not appear to save her; Ser Lothor was Petyrâ<U+0080><U+0099>s man. â<U+0080><U+009C>You shouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t kiss me. I might have been your own daughter...â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Might have been,â<U+0080><U+009D> he admitted, with a rueful smile. â<U+0080><U+009C>But youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not, are you? You are Eddard Starkâ<U+0080><U+0099>s daughter, and Catâ<U+0080><U+0099>s. But I think you might be even more beautiful than your mother was, when she was your age.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Petyr, please.â<U+0080><U+009D> Her voice sounded so weak. â<U+0080><U+009C>Please.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>A castle!â<U+0080><U+009D>
The voice was loud, shrill, and childish. Littleflnger turned away from her. â<U+0080><U+009C>Lord Robert.â<U+0080><U+009D> He sketched a bow. â<U+0080><U+009C>Should you be out in the snow without your gloves?â<U+0080><U+009D>

Â 
Yeah... they screwed up with the Tommen reference. The child actors are growing up and the show timeline is slower paced. On the other hand, people and news seem to travel very fast. Maybe they could try to make it look like time has passed in season 5... but I wonder how they'll do Brienne's story then. The time on the show is a wibbly wobbly timey wimey thing.
4188	Annara Snow	2014-05-20	A new interview with Aidan Gillen: http://www.tvguide.c...en-1081973.aspx
Â 

Â 
Does he think of himself as Sansa's mentor? Or perhaps a father figure?
Gillen: I think kind of a mentor. I think we're also going to see that with Lysa's son Robin Arryn (Lino Facioli) as well. These two young people need some guidance, and I do put myself in that position. I traveled to the Eyrie with Sansa. She assumes this identity, this alias Alayne Stone. She likes it, she likes role playing. It's more like a surrogate avuncular uncle-like relationship. I think a lot of this stuff is complicated.

Â 
So, he at least seems to think she's Alayne Stone on the show. (Bastard? Daughter of a bastard?) And I can't see how they could avoid mentioning her name/identity in the next episode.
Â 
On another note, his interviews are so amusing: "These two young people need some guidance"

Yay! I assumed we'd hear her last name being "Stone" at some point, but this is pretty decent confirmation. I love how he calls killing Lysa an "inspired moment" for LF. Gillen's quite funny.
Â 
EDIT:
Â 
And there's this gem:
"Does he want her as a political pawn or does some of it have to do with Catelyn?Â 
Gillen:Â For sure, and I think Sansa views him as a political pawn too. Or she's probably not thinking politically, but she's playing him. She's becoming something, she's changing. And I think it wouldn't be beyond her to be playing me."

4190	Newstar	2014-05-20	The Thronecast interview with Aiden certainly implies just thatHard to take Aiden's interviews seriously, considering how he has in interviews characterized Petyr's interest in Sansa as paternal, avuncular, and not creepy.
As for Sophie Turner's interviews...let's just say that there's often a disconnect between her take on what she thinks is going on in the show and what appears on screen. Grain of salt and all.
Not very much time has elapsed in the show since Sansa gave her age as 14. She could have turned 15 since, I guess, but she couldn't be any older.

4191	ugashep	2014-05-20	Sorry yall, my quote function does not work. I think it is a distinct possibility that Sansa will turn out to be a tragic figure. Essentially, a little girl with idealistic dreams, that horrible circumstances destroy. This tale is one where there are not going to be happy finalÂ endings for many characters including "good" ones like Sansa. I am not surprised that my post from yesterday was quickly and strongly disagreed with by people who post under names implying a Sansa fanship, in fact that is part of the point I was making. I think thatÂ it is just as likely that theÂ hardcore Sansa fans are reading her wrong as it is that D&D are simply "not getting it".
Â 
Also, to mladen, when I said "ultimately has" in my post above I meant as Newstar suggested, in future books.

4192	Woman of War	2014-05-20	I believe that step by step, so the show only fans won't clearly realize that the timeline is a little bit off, the show will correct the ages of the young characters. After all they have to since otherwise they would have to recast most of them.
And it has some real advantages, just like Martin himself saw the 5 year gap as positive for some character arcs. For example it was necessary to have Sansa naive and young at KL, still young enough that she can dream of beautiful princes and emotionally too young for sex at her wedding with Tyrion, one important aspect of him refusing consummation. And already Turner so very visibly was not fourteen anymore.
And Arya is far more believable at around thirteen or fourteen, the actress - and the character -  could hardly pass for  eleven. Bran is visibly a young man. Robert Arryn already is as tall as his mother was. And Sansa - well, she looks like at least twenty and having her act like a fourteen year old would seem totally off, she'd come over as retarded.The show slightly speeds up time for former child characters and works at letting us forget the ages at the beginning of the story. By now Sansa plays maybe sixteen and next season she will be a believable seven- to eighteen year old, not far from Turner's real age. One small remark about her age and the character of Sansa is old enough for hinting at sex and Baelish and her may become more than partners in crime.
Apart from that Turner looks, as some stated it, "amazonian" or "statuesque". The last thing I want to be is anyhow demeaning since the actress is very beautiful, but she has the frame of an olympic swimmer and looks as if she could wield a weapon not much worse than Brienne. The showmakers simply cannot write the story of a helpless girl for her, again she would come over as dumb. This is no little bird and her  book story has to get a very different twist, the helpless virgin does not really suit her.
Shouldn't we be happy about that? I do not care if her character takes a walk on the darker side since there are no real moral event horizons for Martin's characters. Meaning that wherever Sansa goes, on her own or following Baelish, she can always turn around, just like nearly any other character apart from the Ramsays of that world. And Sansa herself does not know the full extent of what Baelish did, she has no idea of his actions against her family - so why should she see him in a negative light? If she goes along with him having killed Lysa, what else should she hold against him? Obviously not the poisoning, actually she seemed attracted to the possibilities lying in darker actions.  So far she has yet to find out some truths about LF and I hope she will research herself instead of getting secrets served on a silver platter.
And the more Sansa is involved with Baelish the deeper might be his fall in the end (and the better the story may get, and that is what everything is about)
I think it is a distinct possibility that Sansa will turn out to be a tragic figure. Essentially, a little girl with idealistic dreams, that horrible circumstances destroy. This tale is one where there are not going to be happy finalÂ endings for many characters including "good" ones like Sansa.
.....This may happen if Sansa follows Baelish into moral event horizon hell. Possible but less likely than getting a way out imo

4193	juanml82	2014-05-20	I'm willing to concede they understand her if that means they just didn't like her very much. Outcome is the same. My opinion is based mostly on three things: Sansa's blistering rebuke of the Septa in season 1 ("Oh, I forgot. I don't care."); the emmense popularity of Tyrion, Dany, Jon, Bronn, Oberyn, Arya, Jamie and any other character whose plots tend to get more threads and comments than a Sansa one; and the missing seven minutes at the end of last night's episode.




Cat Stark and the awful addition of Talisa would tend to refute that. Also Shae suddenly turning on Tyrion at the trial has confused a lot of unsullied because it is so against the characterisation they have done with her.
While they may talk to the author that doesn't preclude the "wouldn't it be cool if" aspect of deviation or the dude bro nature of the producers. The addition of the Pod brothel scene or the babies in jars at Dragonstone for example. Indeed when you have guest directors weirded out by a producer demanding random naked women in a scene to appeal to the pervert side of the audience, that does not suggest character understanding as much as a guy who has never mentally matured beyond 15.
They are doing what they think will be cool in the adaptation of the books, but that doesn't mean that it is the definitive way to do things or they are getting the right idea across to the viewer ( such as the Jaime raping Cersei scene that they thought they portrayed as consensual).
Some filler they do well; the Brienne/Pod/Hotpie scene was lovely and very much in the spirit of the relationship between the two in the books. However other filler, does not work well.


The show is, in a not too broad definition, fanfiction. And I don't mean it in an insulting tone - many of the greatest narrative works of art in history are, after all, fanfiction. But, and this is important, D&D aren't posting this in ff.net or elsewhere. They are making a multi-million dollar business. So they probably have HBO execs pestering them about the ratings, they have focus groups and other marketing research going on, and they are also trying to set themselves up for newer contracts and projects once the show is over. And you just don't manage that kind of business with the mental age of a fifteen years old teen.
Â 
The changes they make to the source material aren't because they don't like certain characters. That may influence their writing in a subconscious level, but their ultimate goal is to attract viewers and make the best use of the available budget. Some things they have to change because they don't reflect in a TV screen as they do in a book, some because they thing they are cool and some because previous decisions generated backlash discovered in actual marketing research, not by reading Internet forums. Now, some of the changes are good, some are bad and Sansa's arc isn't the offender in that list. IMHO, it's because D&D have the subtlety of a sledgehammer and lack experience in screenwritting. Remember, in the pilot, which would have determined whether the show was made or not, they had not even explained that Cersei and Jaime were siblings. It got approved due the sunk cost fallacy.
Â 
Â 
As for the character ages and the time that passed in the show, I've given up trying to figure that out. Regarding Sansa, she doesn't look fourteen at all. And if a TV character doesn't look fourteen, then it's not fourteen because excuses are not shot.

And it has some real advantages, just like Martin himself saw the 5 year gap as positive for some character arcs. For example it was necessary to have Sansa naive and young at KL, still young enough that she can dream of beautiful princes and emotionally too young for sex at her wedding with Tyrion, one important aspect of him refusing consummation. And already Turner so very visibly was not fourteen anymore.
And Arya is far more believable at around thirteen or fourteen, the actress - and the character - could hardly pass for eleven. Bran is visibly a young man. Robert Arryn already is as tall as his mother was. And Sansa - well, she looks like at least twenty and having her act like a fourteen year old would seem totally off, she'd come over as retarded.The show slightly speeds up time for former child characters and works at letting us forget the ages at the beginning of the story. By now Sansa plays maybe sixteen and next season she will be a believable seven- to eighteen year old, not far from Turner's real age. One small remark about her age and the character of Sansa is old enough for hinting at sex and Baelish and her may become more than partners in crime.
Apart from that Turner looks, as some stated it, "amazonian" or "statuesque". The last thing I want to be is anyhow demeaning since the actress is very beautiful, but she has the frame of an olympic swimmer and looks as if she could wield a weapon not much worse than Brienne. The showmakers simply cannot write the story of a helpless girl for her, again she would come over as dumb. This is no little bird and her book story has to get a very different twist, the helpless virgin does not really suit her.
Shouldn't we be happy about that? I do not care if her character takes a walk on the darker side since there are no real moral event horizons for Martin's characters. Meaning that wherever Sansa goes, on her own or following Baelish, she can always turn around, just like nearly any other character apart from the Ramsays of that world. And Sansa herself does not know the full extent of what Baelish did, she has no idea of his actions against her family - so why should she see him in a negative light? If she goes along with him having killed Lysa, what else should she hold against him? Obviously not the poisoning, actually she seemed attracted to the possibilities lying in darker actions. So far she has yet to find out some truths about LF and I hope she will research herself instead of getting secrets served on a silver platter.
And the more Sansa is involved with Baelish the deeper might be his fall in the end (and the better the story may get, and that is what everything is about)
This may happen if Sansa follows Baelish into moral event horizon hell. Possible but less likely than getting a way out imo


Â 
Um, Sansa and Baelish can't be "partners in crime", let alone consensual lovers  and that has little to do with whether she's 13, 15 or 17 (let alone her height; seriously? That's a ridiculous argument. I guess show!Joffrey should have never had any power, especially not over all those big strong men who obeyed him). Being partners implies a more or less equal relationship. What we have here is a massive power disbalance between one of the politically most powerful men in Westeros, and a girl in a helpless position, with no family, no one to turn to, nowhere to go, who's wanted by the crown for a crime she was framed for (by this very same powerful man) and must hide her identity unless someone takes her to King's Landing to be tried and executed. In addition, this powerful man is now girl's legal guardian in the eyes of the world, and she has little choice but to hope that the powerful man will keep protecting her from being taken to the queen and getting her head chopped off, and that, preferably, he will not make her his sex slave yet.
Â 
As for a potential "consensual love affair" between Sansa and LF, that would be like saying Craster relationships with his daughter-wives was consensual.
Â 
Re: Sansa not being "emotionally mature" for sex with Tyrion - so, I guess, a girl has to reach a certain level of emotional maturity before she decides that it would be a good idea to have sex with a man she finds completely unattractive and that she was forced to marry by her captors, who had been waging a war against her family, in order to use her to get her family's lands... because... uh, I don't know? I can't think of any reason why she would have wanted to have sex with him.

But I guess the show just condenses her story and takes it there where it was meant to go anyway by Martin.

This is reminding me of the people saying that she should have been able to spinning-dragon-kick Lysa out the Moon Door.Come on, she should have fought her way out of King's Landing. It is known. 
A few days ago I saw someone (not on this forum) say that she didn't want to leave King's Landing and that's why she didn't take any of the "many chances" to leave, because she liked the "comfort" and riches more than being with her family. *double facepalm*
4201	Woman of War	2014-05-20	... And reportedly someone said (not on this forum) that Sansa will feed Sweetrobin as pies to Baelish since he confessed to be the boy's father. 
We can find all kinds of stuff out there in the big bad world wide web
4202	Chebyshov	2014-05-20	And she shows fear exactly how?


Â 
By screaming and stifling sobs? I know what you mean though, in that she's pretty direct with him, but I don't think it's much of a departure. Saying that Book!Sansa is "afraid" of LF is a bit reductive. I think she's mistrustful and a bit creeped out, but not really afraid.
Â 
Â 

He is serving me lies as well, Sansa realized. They were comforting lies, though, and she thought them kindly meant. A lie is not so bad if it is kindly meant. If only she believed them...

Â 
Â 
Â 
He saved Alayne, his daughter, a voice within her whispered. But she was Sansa too... and sometimes it seemed to her that the Lord Protector was two people as well. He was Petyr, her protector, warm and funny and gentle... but he was also Littlefinger, the lord sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>d known at Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing, smiling slyly and stroking his beard as he whispered in Queen Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ear. And Littlefinger was no friend of hers. When Joff had her beaten, the Imp defended her, not Littlefinger. When the mob sought to rape her, the Hound carried her to safety, not Littlefinger. When the Lannisters wed her to Tyrion against her will, Ser Garlan the Gallant gave her comfort, not Littlefinger. Littlefinger never lifted so much as his little finger for her.
Â 
Except to get me out. He did that for me. I thought it was Ser Dontos, my poor old drunken Florian, but it was Petyr all the while. Littlefinger was only a mask he had to wear. Only sometimes Sansa found it hard to tell where the man ended and the mask began. Littlefinger and Lord Petyr looked so very much alike. She would have fled them both, perhaps, but there was nowhere for her to go.

No bravely going to the wood at night to meet the anonymous person who promises to help her escape, carrying a knife; no planning her escape. 
You seem to have a very odd idea about "agency". Like, if I say that Gilly was sexually abused by her father, you'd probably say that I'm denying her "agency", and that maybe she made him think she liked to have sex with him sometimes to get a bit more food or avoid a beating, and if she did, that made her empowered and emotionally mature.

Â 
As for a potential "consensual love affair" between Sansa and LF, that would be like saying Craster relationships with his daughter-wives was consensual.
Not really. A better potential comparator would be Dany/Drogo. Their love relationship could never be truly consensual, as many of the factors you list for Petyr and Sansa were also present in that relationship--power imbalance, underage girl, helpless and friendless girl on the run with nowhere to go and no one to turn to, massively powerful man who could treat her as a sex slave if he wished to, any consent is considered negated where a partner is underage (statutory rape), etc.--and yet despite these factors, GRRM sold the relationship they ultimately had as a consensual one and even as a love story that Dany found empowering. TLDR, GRRM's done this before.
Also, arguing that a power imbalance means that GRRM won't go for a love affair between politically powerful man X and far less powerful girl Y strikes me as odd. If anything, GRRM has founded many of the few seemingly healthy, "consensual" relationships in the books on such huge power imbalances: Tyrion/Tysha (while it lasted), Oberyn/Ellaria, Illyrio/Serra, Dany/Drogo, even Daemon/Nettles in TPATQ.
I think by "consensual love affair," what's meant is "about as consensual as it could be under the circumstances, taking into account all the things that militate against free consent, like the power imbalance, Sansa being underage, Sansa's desperate circumstances, etc." The use of the word "consensual" is a bit dicey, but I think it's meant to distinguish from scenarios where, say, LF turns Sansa into his sex slave or where Sansa coldly seduces LF for her own ends and feigns love for him. Maybe "pseudo consensual" is a better way of putting it: not truly consensual, but closer to Dany/Drogo than to Ramsay/Jeyne.

Â 
This has been perfectly covered by another poster in a book thread, which saves me the time to write an answer.
Â 
Â 


I seriously doubt it, but I am disturbed by how some people here seem to not only think Sansa will be sexually abused by LF, but apparently are looking forward to it, or think the only way a Sansa chapter could be "controversial" is if it involves sexual abuse. Or think that GRRM is such a hack writer that he'll delve into detailed POV descriptions of sexual abuse just for the shock value. Yes GRRM mentions sexual abuse and rape many times but it's not described in detail (to the point some fans, for example, overlook what Arya witnessed at Harrenhal.) Even what happens to Jeyne Poole is addressed in a very subtle manner, no graphic descriptions, just enough for the reader to know what a monster Ramsay is.As for comparisons to Drogo/Dany, the BIG difference is that Drogo treated her as a wife, not a daughter. Now, considering the Dothraki culture that doesn't mean he treated her as an equal peer, I personally think he didn't treat her that well early in the marriage. But, it was Dany herself who took the initiative to learn more about sex, not just passively taking "lessons", and assert herself as a more equal partner, and Drogo actually loved her for her "fierceness" and came to actually take what she said seriously, to the point of letting her defy centuries of Dothraki tradition when she defended the Lamb Women from rape.
LF, on the other hand, is presenting himself as BOTH father-figure and lover, and demanding inappropriate kisses from her AS a father, not as a suitor. That's what makes his obsession with Sansa so creepy, that he's specifically using his position as an authority figure to coerce her into sexual activity. It's the M.O. of many real life predators who sexually abuse both children and teenagers, they don't approach them as they would a peer, they take jobs such as teacher, sports coach, Boy Scout leader, etc., that already give them power over their victims, and use that power to take advantage of them. Do you really think LF would like it if Sansa asserted herself and wanted a more equal partnership? I don't. That's a big difference between Sansa and Dany's situations, even if their ages are similar.
BTW, as mambru mentioned Lysa, While many fans discussing LF and Sansa think Sansa is "Cat 2.0" to him, I actually think that much of LF's behavior toward Sansa is based on what worked for him earlier with Lysa. Lysa actually seems impressed by LF's "cleverness" when he tells her to kill Jon Arryn and blame the Lannisters for it, and I think LF spent a lot of time bragging about his schemes to Lysa as well, knowing she was too besotted with him to oppose anything (except, perhaps, anything that would jeopardize SR's welfare, it seems LF sold his plans to Lysa as either (1) What we need to do so we can finally be together and (2) What we need to do to keep SR safe.) Now, I don't think LF plans to discard Sansa as he did Lysa, but for all we know, if LF never met Sansa, he'd have kept Lysa around as "Cat 2.0".

If "taking part" will go the way everybody in these forums likes or if she will go a different road some do not enjoy, who knows. But she is for sure no silent mouse.
And out there in the real world the word "agency" may have a meaning that makes sense. But in these forums it is the most cheapened expression and by now can only be used with heavy gravy of irony on top.

It's true that there's plenty that's offensive, objectionable and creepy when it comes to LF and Sansa, but that's equally true in a different sense with Dany and Drogo--swap out daddy/daughter role play and classic grooming behavior for the touching tale of a girl falling in love with her rapist and how her strength of character is signaled by her occasional pleasure when being raped--and GRRM blithely sold it as a grand romance, or as a consensual love affair at least. It would be naive to assume that there's no way he'll do it again.

No, it really wouldn't be. It's pretty clear from the way he wrote LF/Sansa, as opposed to how he wrote Dany/Drogo (which I'm no fan of - except in the sense that it plays its role in Dany's development and I could see how it seemed like a romance from her POV) that this is no story of a romance or a consensual love affair. I don't know think that GRRM could have made LF/Sansa creepier or less romantic or sexy if he tried, short of having him rape her.
Â 
If you were a writer trying to sell a love story or consensual love affair between a teenage girl in helpless position and an older man in position of authority (and there sure have been many such stories), the way GRRM has been writing LF/Sansa is almost like a textbook of everything you shouldn't do. And that was obviously intentional, it's not like he seems to be trying to set up a romance/erotic affair and failing, he seems to be trying and doing the exact opposite.

The kiss in particular. I've always thought that Littlefinger didn't entirely understand his interest in Sansa either. In AFFV Sansa remarks on his seemingly dual nature. Petyr might actually view Sansa as his daughter, the one he should have had with Catelyn. While Littlefinger sees her as a replacement Catelyn and be sexually interested in her as such.
I mentioned that because his mask dropped in that seen. Maybe Littlefinger had more practical reasons for the Purple Wedding, reasons to do with political gainand personal advancement but Petyr had personal reasons for murdering Joffrey that I believe had to do with Catelyns death at the Red Weddding.
At least in the scene in the show his demeanor became less smug when he said that line. He sounded like he was speaking from the heart. Then Sansa smiles at him and he continues to talk about his personal feelings and he kisses her.
When she pushes him away though, his face looks as shocked as Sansas. Like he knows he did something he shouldn't have, or at least that he surprised himself. He does that alot around Sansa, from touching her hair the first time he meets her, to telling her that her eyes are honest and true, as deep blue as a sunlit sea. And she thinks to herself that he looks at her as if hes seeing her for the first time.

GRRM talks about this here:Â https://www.youtube....h?v=MtYhmD2TZs0

He credits LF as having a three-way nature in relation to Sansa (thrice nature?). But yeah, I quoted that part of Alayne's chapter on the previous page. It's a complex relationship, and will be interesting to see how it develops next season (where they'll either be completely off-book, or in TWOW material, most likely).

Sadly, the books have several love affairs--not all of which are sold as a great love story as Dany/Drogo was, although it's telling that GRRM's great love story of the books has all those elements which you insist mean that LF/Sansa can never happen--that have creepy, dysfunctional, or even downright abusive elements, but which are nonetheless treated as consensual or pseudo-consensual love affairs at the very least. You're really in the wrong series if you're arguing that X and Y won't have a (pseudo) consensual hookup because it would be creepy, disturbing, offensive, and fucked up. If anything, that makes it more likely.

Say what you will about GRRM, but nobody can accuse him of trying to make that dynamic sexy or romantic, or set it up as a consensual affair.

I'm not sure what you mean with the' fooled by a fool' part, Sansa always had severe doubts of the escape plan with Dontos (she did not trust his competence, was afraid he was only giving empty promises, was frustrated he did not reveal anything of the plans etc.), but she took the chance because it was the only option she had. In case you forgot the parts where Sansa asks questions in the books, I collected a few for you (from Sansa V-VII ASOS):
Â 
Â 
In the books Sansa herself realizes an 'amethyst' is missing, and starts to realize the implications and demands answers from Dontos:

Â 
"You said I must wear the hair net. The silver net with . . . what sort of stones are those?"
"Amethysts. Black amethysts from Asshai, my lady."
"They're no amethysts. Are they? Are they? You lied."
"Black amethysts," he swore. "There was magic in them."
"There was murder in them!"

Sansa questions LF's motives for the murder:

Â 
He had this all prepared for me. "My lord, I . . . I do not understand . . . Joffrey gave you Harrenhal, made you Lord Paramount of the Trident . . . why . . . "

She blames LF for framing an innocent man:

Â 
Sometimes she dreamed of Tyrion as well. "He did nothing," she told Littlefinger once

She questions LF for not taking her home:

Â 
"Couldn't I stay on the ship until we make sail for White Harbor?"
"From here the King turns east for Braavos. Without us."
"But . . . my lord, you said . . . you said we were sailing home."

She questions LF for not taking her home for a second time:

Â 
Petyr yelped, as the snow slid down under his collar. "That was unchivalrously done, my lady."
"As was bringing me here, when you swore to take me home."
She calls him out on kissing her instead of just staring like she is dumb.

Â 
"What are you doing?"
Petyr straightened his cloak. "Kissing a snow maid."
"You're supposed to kiss her." Sansa glanced up at Lysa's balcony, but it was empty now. "Your lady wife."
.....
"You shouldn't kiss me. I might have been your own daughter . . . ".

She realizes something is very wrong when she is brought in front of Lysa:

Â 
He would not leave. "My lady said to bring you."
Bring me? She did not like the sound of that. "Are you a guardsman now?"
.....
Marillion swung the doors shut and barred them with a third spear, longer and thicker than those the guards had borne.
Sansa felt a prickle of unease. "Why did you do that?"

4215	Newstar	2014-05-20	I never said that Sansa couldn't end up in Baelish's bed for reasons of survival, I just don't see how that could be presented as a consensual love affair, especially with GRRM having written it the way he has. Say what you will about GRRM, but nobody can accuse him of trying to make that dynamic sexy or romantic, or set it up as a consensual affair.
Jaime/Cersei is hardly written as sexy or romantic, either--I can think of few things less sexy than their altar sex interlude, and GRRM was clearly going to some pains to make it as nasty as possible--but it is a consensual love affair (in the books, at least), as gross, nasty, creepy and wrong as it may be.
As for GRRM doing nothing to lay the groundwork for a pseudo-consensual love affair, I'd say the last Alayne chapter does plenty in that regard, but that's been covered before.

I'm at a loss  where you saw anything consensual there on Sansa's part, or any sign of even a remotest sexual or romantic interest from her.
What do you even mean by pseudo-consensual in this case? She will endure him fucking her like she endures him kissing her? He will be able to fool himself that she wants him? Perfectly possible, but "consensual love affair" that some folks here are talking about it certainly wouldn't be.

4218	juanml82	2014-05-20	Okay. So....the moment didn't play out in the show like it didin the books, but it was still interesting.
The kiss in particular. I've always thought that Littlefinger didn't entirely understand his interest in Sansa either. In AFFV Sansa remarks on his seemingly dual nature. Petyr might actually view Sansa as his daughter, the one he should have had with Catelyn. While Littlefinger sees her as a replacement Catelyn and be sexually interested in her as such.
I mentioned that because his mask dropped in that seen. Maybe Littlefinger had more practical reasons for the Purple Wedding, reasons to do with political gainand personal advancement but Petyr had personal reasons for murdering Joffrey that I believe had to do with Catelyns death at the Red Weddding.
At least in the scene in the show his demeanor became less smug when he said that line. He sounded like he was speaking from the heart. Then Sansa smiles at him and he continues to talk about his personal feelings and he kisses her.
When she pushes him away though, his face looks as shocked as Sansas. Like he knows he did something he shouldn't have, or at least that he surprised himself. He does that alot around Sansa, from touching her hair the first time he meets her, to telling her that her eyes are honest and true, as deep blue as a sunlit sea. And she thinks to herself that he looks at her as if hes seeing her for the first time.
That was my take on that scene as it played out.


I don't know about that reason for the PW. I think he was closer to honesty in the boat. If he wanted revenge for the RW, he would have aimed at Tywin, not Joffrey. And, at least in the books, we know that the plan for the PW was underway since the moment LF brokered the alliance with the Tyrells.
So I think he gave her a lie which Sansa was more inclined to believe than the truth. However, I also believe LF wants revenge for the RW and he's aiming at the Freys - he has both emotional and pragmatical reasons to destroy them - and wants to check how willing is Sansa to join Frey Hunting Season, hence the line about "people who hurt the ones we love". Fortunately, Sansa seems quite willing to join the FHS.
4219	The Fenris Wolf	2014-05-20	I never said that Sansa couldn't end up in Baelish's bed for reasons of survival (that's actually a constant unpleasant possibility in her Vale chapters, she has already been enduring his kisses and pushing them completely out of mind, she seems to have mastered the art of detachment), I just don't see how that could be presented as a consensual love affair, especially with GRRM having written it the way he has. Say what you will about GRRM, but nobody can accuse him of trying to make that dynamic sexy or romantic, or set it up as a consensual affair.


Â 
Why wouldn't that be consensual? Â Shae and Tyrion are consensual, Jamie and Cersei are consensual, Prince Oberyn and Ellaria are consensual. Â There's significant power and prestige differences in all those relationships. Â The fact that she'd be doing it to survive doesn't make it less so in my opinion, though to be frank she'd be doing a damn sight better than just "surviving" if she does eventually agree to share his bed. Â To be the lover and companion to one of the most powerful men in the realm means that she'd be living a life of unimaginable safety and comfort, one denied to about 90% of the people of Westeros. Â I think it's pointless to force 21st century romantic standards onto what is essentially a medieval society.
Â 
By this logic, practically none of the relationships, either professional or romantic, are consensual in Martin's story. Â The Hound had a death sentence the moment he left the king's service. Â How much 'agency' did he have over his life? Â Robb was told who to marry and when, and of course so was his Frey betrothed. Â Is their marriage not consensual? Â King Robert and Cersei had a loveless marriage, and I doubt either one of them would have picked the other for themselves. Â Cersei constantly talked with loathing of how Robert would stumble to bed and force himself on her, but I doubt she would ever describe it as rape. Â Through our modern eyes, I don't know if it could be called anything else. Â And of course Robert hated her and had his heart set on Lyanna and never wanted to marry her in the first place. Â

Your argument's a bit hard to follow, Annara Snow, probably because I keep refuting your points and so you keep changing your argument. But to sum up: 
1. Power imbalances, statutory rape, etc. do not negate a consensual love affair in ASOIAF as far as GRRM's concerned (Dany/Drogo)
2. Relationships deliberately written as creepy, unsexy or unromantic or even as containing abusive elements can still be consensual love affairs in ASOIAF as far as GRRM's concerned (Jaime/Cersei, although I could list others)
3. Even though LF and Sansa's relationship has massive power imbalances and creepy and even abusive elements, and even as it's written as unsexy and offputting, GRRM may still write LF/Sansa as a pseudo-consensual love affair in future books.
4221	Newstar	2014-05-20	The Alayne chapters do the exact opposite of that. I'm at a loss  where you saw anything consensual there on Sansa's part, or any sign of even a remotest sexual or romantic interest from her.

4222	Annara Snow	2014-05-20	Not the thread for it, but it's been amply discussed elsewhere.Yes, it has, and no one has managed to come up with a plausible scenario in which Sansa would be having a sexual relationship with LF that could be considered consensual.

Oh I like that--anything that brings us closer to the source material.
4225	ugashep	2014-05-20	Legally rape generally involves the penetration of a bodily orifice by violence or threat of violence. It also can be rape where consent is obtained through deception (for example by impersonating one's spouse). Rape as a result of the nature of the relationship is most often a prohibition related to age like the statutory rape concept we have in the U.S. There does not appear to be a statutory rape in Westeros so its hard to are how that could apply. Even using the common U.S. definition of rape it seems pretty foolish to argue that GRRM has laid no groundwork whatsoever for non-rape sex  to even have the possibility to occur between LF and Sansa.

Just to conclude this argument thoroughly and to understand what personal bickering is, I will apply the 'consensual' relationship with Sansa and LF to the show.
Â 
In other words, no. No, no no no no. Although I wouldn't put it past D&D to make Sansa and LF have a romantic affair, GRRM will probably not write that. I'm sure we all know why, I dearly hope. What does this mean forÂ Show!Sansa? I cannot say. I can only predict and speculate on this matter. I don't think it's going to be sunshine and bunnies however, and it will most likely result in the death of a character. LF, Robin, or both LF and Robin. They both are irritating, one slightly more than the other.
Â 
I also don't think that Sansa is going to tell the 'truth' about LF in the next episode, because it seems quite early for this to happen. The question to ask is, who the hell was she talking to? Mayhaps I should watch it again...

Jesus, I'm not from USA but really hope that this is not the legal definition in many US states, because that sounds horribly outdated. I'll try not to discuss rape much, but I have to say I'd find it really disturbing if people thought that a person has to be penetrated to be raped (fits with "men can't be raped if they have an erection") and if it sex obtained through coercion, threats (unless it's direct violence), abuse of authority, including that of a family member over a child, master over slave (including sex trafficking), husband over a child bride, kidnapper over hostage, or temporary or permanent incapacity of a person (including being unconscious) would be considered "consensual", if the victim isn't screaming and fighting.

I actually wouldn't mind that. It would make the preview all the more troll-y.

Â 
Goes to show awful TV and movies still tend to be in showing female desire, when scenes in which females are passive and emotionless while guys are kissing them but don't push them away after a second are taken by some of the viewers as romantic kisses that they're enjoying, when we don't have the POV in a book where the character is thinking something like "WTF is this now... ugh, awkward... and his lips are tasting of [insert random taste]." The way people reacted to the Gale/Katniss kiss in Catching Fire also comes to mind.

Well, she has no reason not to trust that he wouldn't send her to Cersei, so she knows that he, at least, will try to keep her alive, because his interest in/agendas with her are different. That's what it all comes down to - it's not that she trusts him that much in the books, but she doesn't have anyone else she can trust.
4240	Petyr Patter	2014-05-20	Â 
Jesus, I'm not from USA but really hope that this is not the legal definition in many US states, because that sounds horribly outdated.

Â 
Well, most sex crimes are dealt with on the state level in the US, meaning there are 50 different legal definitions surround "sexual violence."Â  I do believe rape is mostly defined as penetration in the absence of consent, or consent obtained with threat of violence.Â  There is also "statutory rape," which means a sexual act is defined by law as rape, even if it was otherwise consensual.Â  Mostly statutory rape is related to "age of consent," which varies state by state.Â  Meaning a consensual relationship between a 14 year old and a 21 year old can be prosecuted.Â  I know some states extend the definition past age and include relationship of authority as a type of rape.Â  For example, a high school teacher no matter how young compared to his or her students, is always in a position of authority over them and any sexual relationship could be prosecuted.
Â 
Regardless, there are certainly other laws that protect against sexual violence that doesn't include explicit penetration.Â  Instead, terms like "sexual harassment," "sexual battery," or "sexual assault" are the legal definitions.Â  Long story short, most obvious acts of sexual violence are prosecutable under some aspect of state or federal law.Â  Certainly sex traffickers would not be able to skirt by technicalities.Â 
Â 
The biggest problem with sexual violence in America is not in the wording of the law, but in proving an encounter was in fact non-consenual.Â  In a lot of cases, the only witness to the assault was the victim herself.Â  However, when a perpetrator is questioned, he claims the sex was consensual.Â  Without any other evidence, most juries cannot find the person guilty "beyond a reasonable doubt," especially if drugs and alcohol were involved.
Â 
To tie this back to Sansa and Littlefinger, yeah, that kiss would totally get him locked up in America due to Sansa's age.
Â 
I do wish the show had made the lack of consent clearer.Â  A couple lines of protest after the fact would have gotten the point across.Â  Or a different angle where we see Sansa's face reacting in shock.
4241	Rapsie	2014-05-20	Sansa actively challenges Baelish and asks the right questions. This will forward her taking part far more than getting fooled by the fool with Florian and Jonquil stories. If "taking part" will go the way everybody in these forums likes or if she will go a different road some do not enjoy, who knows. But she is for sure no silent mouse.
And out there in the real world the word "agency" may have a meaning that makes sense. But in these forums it is the most cheapened expression and by now can only be used with heavy gravy of irony on top.

She challenged him and knew he was lying to her in the books. She is being led along by him in the TV series. 
In the books she was complicit in her own escape and worked out the poison on her own, the dangers of Loras, Marg and Joff etc. The Florian and Jonquil story parallels her previous belief that all knights were good, such as one might believe that cops are all good, only to find they are not, but still hope that there are some who will stand up and be counted. This is not childish. 
In the books Sansa distinguishes between Knights and True Knights, which is her looking for men who abide by a code in the same way one might hope for a Policeman who is honest after having to deal with corrupt cops. 
She certainly is brighter in the books. 
Also if you don't know the meaning of Agency I suggest you look it up. It is fairly easy to understand.

Â 
I'm not seeing the similarity. They made Shae/Tyrion a genuine romance in order to make Tyrion look better and less delusional. Why on Earth would they be trying to make Sansa have a "love affair" with LF of all people? To make her look worse? To make LF look like a good guy? Nah.
Â 
I also find it hilarious that a couple of weeks ago, people were thinking the show was somehow paving the way for Sansa hook up with Tyrion in the end, now she's going to hook up with LF... If Marillion was in the show in his original role, I bet people would think she was going to hook up with him, too, unless Sansa karate-chopped him or something.  And this on the same forum where a lot of people were arguing last week that the show will only have LF kiss her on a cheek or hug her, while others have claimed that the casting of a 40-year old as Sandor is a sure sign that there is never ever going to be anything romantic between him and Sansa...
4244	Chebyshov	2014-05-20	She certainly is brighter in the books.

We are privy to her thoughts in the books. Note in the show she does challenge his motives for the PW. It's not as proactive a role, but don't assume that Show!Sansa is less intelligent.

Â 


I took it different when he answered what do we do to those who kill the ones we love, I think her smile outside is hiding in her mind I know what you want sucker.


Maybe. But, then again, we have the previous Sansa reaction to Robin's idea of placing a Moon Door in the actual Winterfell. In other words, if LF wants vengeance for Catelyn, why would anyone think Sansa doesn't want the same thing?
Â 


I think Petyr will tell Sansa that if she doesn't cooperate, he will tell the lords that Sansa killed Lysa


Too blunt, I don't think so.
Â

Very likely. I guess they both prepare it. LF tells some bullshit story that's too romantic/hard to believe/whatever, and then Alayne "tells the truth", saying a version of the death that's easier to swallow and probably makes LF looks like a loving husband.

Goes to show awful TV and movies still tend to be in showing female desire, when scenes in which females are passive and emotionless while guys are kissing them but don't push them away after a second are taken by some of the viewers as romantic kisses that they're enjoying, when we don't have the POV in a book where the character is thinking something like "WTF is this now... ugh, awkward... and his lips are tasting of [insert random taste]." The way people reacted to the Gale/Katniss kiss in Catching Fire also comes to mind.


The book and show work under a different canon. The thoughts of BookSansa may not apply to ShowSansa.
Â 


Next episode will clearly cover the substance of AFFC Sansa I, and at least some of the content of AFFC Alayne I, though not necessarily the whole thing.


Well, it's the meeting with Nestor Royce but with some of the characters of the Lords Declarant meeting instead. And we also have Littlefinger's line about how defensible the Eyre is from previous episodes. So, who knows... if there is no Harry the Hair, they might even burn through a lot of her AFFC material in just one episode
4246	The Fenris Wolf	2014-05-20	Â 
Well, most sex crimes are dealt with on the state level in the US, meaning there are 50 different legal definitions surround "sexual violence."Â  I do believe rape is mostly defined as penetration in the absence of consent, or consent obtained with threat of violence.Â  There is also "statutory rape," which means a sexual act is defined by law as rape, even if it was otherwise consensual.Â  Mostly statutory rape is related to "age of consent," which varies state by state.Â  Meaning a consensual relationship between a 14 year old and a 21 year old can be prosecuted.Â  I know some states extend the definition past age and include relationship of authority as a type of rape.Â  For example, a high school teacher no matter how young compared to his or her students, is always in a position of authority over them and any sexual relationship could be prosecuted.
Â 
Regardless, there are certainly other laws that protect against sexual violence that doesn't include explicit penetration.Â  Instead, terms like "sexual harassment," "sexual battery," or "sexual assault" are the legal definitions.Â  Long story short, most obvious acts of sexual violence are prosecutable under some aspect of state or federal law.Â  Certainly sex traffickers would not be able to skirt by technicalities.Â 
Â 
The biggest problem with sexual violence in America is not in the wording of the law, but in proving an encounter was in fact non-consenual.Â  In a lot of cases, the only witness to the assault was the victim herself.Â  However, when a perpetrator is questioned, he claims the sex was consensual.Â  Without any other evidence, most juries cannot find the person guilty "beyond a reasonable doubt," especially if drugs and alcohol were involved.
Â 
To tie this back to Sansa and Littlefinger, yeah, that kiss would totally get him locked up in America due to Sansa's age.
Â 
I do wish the show had made the lack of consent clearer.Â  A couple lines of protest after the fact would have gotten the point across.Â  Or a different angle where we see Sansa's face reacting in shock.


You gave a perfect summary of rape / sexual violence laws in America. Â Still I hate to beat a dead horse, but I think it's important to remember that though what was going on between LF and Sansa could be prosecuted here, that doesn't mean ANYTHING regarding the laws and customs of Westeros. Â Ned Stark executed men caught on his lands that were fugitives from the Night's Watch, and no one ever questioned his right in doing so. Â Could you imagine a governor or senator trying something like that today? Â "Well you see, the local police department in Podunk caught this guy who has been AWOL from his Army unit for the past six months. Â So I drove down there, picked him up, and brought him back to the capital. Â Then I put him in front of some witnesses in front of the capital building, and shot him." Â It's absurd on it's face. Â There are any number of constitutional violations going on there, plus questions of public safety (discharging a firearm in a public place), due process, inevitable discussions of why he was AWOL in the first place. Â None of that is ever considered when it's Eddard Stark, because that's just how things are done in Westeros.
Â 
All I'm saying is that if we're going to try and bring modern feminist theory to bear and deconstruct all male/female relationships in GoT, we may as well use modern consitutional or legal theories when discussing the behavior of lords vis a vis their vassals and serfs.
4247	Newstar	2014-05-20	The biggest concern I have is that Sansa's TWoW arc is going to be spoiled in season 5, well before the earliest possible completion date of the book.You say that like it's a bad thing. By 2015, GRRM will have let 10 years elapse with no news of Sansa. 10 years. If he lets D&D beat him to the punch, he'll have no one to blame but himself. I'll be first in line to drink GRRM's tears if that happens.
The funny thing is that if TWOW remains unreleased by the time Season 5 rolls around, we'll have no way of knowing whether the new material is TWOW stuff or Qarth-style filler. I am cautiously optimistic that we're zipping through Sansa's AFFC arc because it means that they're barreling ahead to get to TWOW territory...although they could just do what they did with Bran (who's only appearing in four eps this season) and slow her arc to a crawl in Season 5, or what they did with Arya this season (stretch a thin bit of material from the books over several episodes with lots of philosophical conversations and plot detours and such).
As for the kiss, because we can't access any character's thoughts on a kiss while it's happening, body language of the actor playing the kissee counts a lot. There are ways to suggest with body language that the kissee is not into it without showing overt struggling or shoving the kisser away. Is the kissee relaxed or tense? Are they leaning into or out of the kiss? Do they freeze up when kissed and stay frozen (as opposed to the whole freezing in shock at first and then melting in the kisser's embrace and such)? Is their body language self-protective at all? And so on.
The interesting thing about the Sansa kiss is that as it appears in the episode, Sansa's body language seems more relaxed: she's leaning into the kiss, her eyes are closed and relaxed, and you can really only see the actors' heads and shoulders (much like the Joffrey/Sansa kiss). However, there's a still of the LF/Sansa kiss, showing a different story. Sansa's eyes are screwed shut in pain or discomfort, and you can clearly see her arm in front of her chest as if she's bracing herself or trying to protect herself. So it really might be that the acting/directing didn't match up with the intent of the writers.

Â 
In common law countries, the U.S., U.K., Commonwealth territories, the traditional definition of rape requires "penetration" and the "slightest penetration completes the crime", againÂ that is part of the definition of "rape" traditionally and in most cases remains so today. Keep in mind however that pretty much every example you give is a serious crime in the U.S. We call human trafficking eitherÂ "human trafficking" or "slavery". When it is aÂ prepubescent child who is the victim we call it "child molestation" or some variant thereof.Â If it isÂ a post puberty but under 18 teenagerÂ victim attacked by an adult, even if it isÂ would otherwise be "consensual" ifÂ the victim was not under 18, we still call it "statutory rape". We do not get really broad withÂ the term "coercion" as it relates to rape,Â the termÂ certainly covers violence, direct,Â and threatened (express or implied) which is what I meant when I referred to "threat of violence" beforeÂ but other laws address the coercion of sex through financialÂ or some otherÂ kinds of coercion for example, anti-blackmail laws, anti-pandering/prostitution laws, anti-sexual harassment laws, etc.Â Unwanted touching of the genitals without penetration is usually prosecuted as "sexual battery" or something similar. To the extent you have been arguing purely that Sansa's under 18 age status will always make it rape, yes in the modern world that's true, things were different howeverÂ in the Middle AgesÂ the period on earth which most closely parellels Westeros. Back thenÂ  most people couldn't expect to live past 40, so the appropriate age for the concept of "consent" was a lot earlier, likewiseÂ  things are different in Westeros. The age question aside, I think the books have certainly laid the groundwork that a consensual relationship between Sansa and LF is a possibility, however gross it is to many of us. And judging by the reactions to the idea on the forum it would certainly fit the "controversial with some elements of the fanbase" remark.

If you want to discuss that, I suggest General Chatter where you can discuss as much as you want what constitutes rape according to this and that law. This isn't thread for that.

So, stick to Sansa, before this small derailment of several posts gets out of control.Â

Â 
Uh, I haven't argued that at all. Maybe you should re-read my posts.
Â 
What is defined as "rape" and what "sexual assault" or "battery" etc. is not really the point. All of these fall into the non-consensual category. I was arguing against the idea that Sansa is in her position to be LF's "partner in crime", or have a "consensual love affair" with him, as some here have been claiming, both of which would imply freedom and choice, with the former also implying an equal relationship.

Compared to Bran or Arya, though, there was no inherent reason that Sansa's story needed to be structured like this.Â  Bran has, let's face it, almost no adaptable story in ASOS or ADWD, and what little he has in ASOS is intrinsically tied to events in Jon's story which have to occur at a certain point.Â  Arya's story, likewise, is tied fairly tightly into the Red Wedding at a certain point.Â  Conversely, there was no real structural reason that Sansa's ASOS material had to be finished by episode 7 (particularly when they omitted things like the Fingers), so it would have to have been a deliberate choice on their part to go through the material at this pace.
Â 
If they came up with this story structure and then planned to spend season 5 running on the fumes of her last AFFC chapter, that's pretty awful planning.

I'm not seeing the similarity. They made Shae/Tyrion a genuine romance in order to make Tyrion look better and less delusional. Why on Earth would they be trying to make Sansa have a "love affair" with LF of all people? To make her look worse? To make LF look like a good guy? Nah.
Â 
I also find it hilarious that a couple of weeks ago, people were thinking the show was somehow paving the way for Sansa hook up with Tyrion in the end, now she's going to hook up with LF... If Marillion was in the show in his original role, I bet people would think she was going to hook up with him, too, unless Sansa karate-chopped him or something.  And this on the same forum where a lot of people were arguing last week that the show will only have LF kiss her on a cheek or hug her, while others have claimed that the casting of a 40-year old as Sandor is a sure sign that there is never ever going to be anything romantic between him and Sansa...


I don't have an answer for this, but then again I find most of the changes they make utterly ridiculous. So I would not anything past them, really. And they seem to want to add 'romantic' scenes (Shae is in love, Talisa whole storyline, even Ramsay has a girlfriend)
Â 
The example of Sansa and Tyrion you yourself give is a good one; it seems like they wanted to make fans believe their marriage could 'work out', only to destroy it few scenes later. They clearly wanted to play with some will they/won't they 'intrigue'  . So I would not be surprised if something similar was done with LF.
4254	Newstar	2014-05-20	And yet Dany had a relationship with Drogo billed by GRRM as a consensual love affair and one of equality, despite the many factors involved--power imbalance, powerful man, helpless and friendless girl, no power to refuse sexual advances, etc.--that would render Dany's consent meaningless, even though Annara Snow has argued that those same factors mean that LF and Sansa's relationship could never be a treated as a consensual love affair in the books.
Strictly speaking, Sansa is no more free to fall in love with LF than Dany was truly free to fall in love with Drogo. And yet the books accept that Dany did, so I can't argue that Sansa necessarily won't for that reason.
I'm not saying that LF and Sansa will have any sort of consensual love affair. God forbid! It's only that it's a terrible argument that they can't have a consensual love affair because of things like power imbalance, which applied equally to Dany/Drogo. Nor is it any argument to claim that they won't because GRRM has not written them as sexy or romantic (as opposed to the profoundly unsexy altar sex scene, I guess), or that they won't because it would have creepy or abusive beginnings (as opposed to Drogo raping Dany until she starts to enjoy it).

Well, as you said, nothing came out of it and it ended just like in the book. Sansa did not fall in love with Tyrion, surprise, surprise, the marriage did not 'work out'. Tyrion is in love with Shae in the books and believes they have something; Robb did marry a girl he wasn't supposed to, who he claims to love in the book (why fans prefer to think he was lying and only ever told the truth when he said that he also had to marry her because of honor, I don't know), even though it wasn't a terribly cliche romance as in the show... How would any of this be similar to Sansa somehow being portrayed as a completely free and equal partner to LF who decides to start sleeping with him because she finds him so attractive, or whatever? Even if that kind of plot made any sense under her circumstances. And why would the show runners even want to do that? It's pretty easy to see what they were going for with Shae or Talisa, but what motive could they have for that kind of change?

  It doesn't make any sense to rush her story like this if they are just going to have to make stuff up for the entire next season. There was no need for her to be in 8 out of 10 episodes. The AFFC material is thin as it, and even if they had finished season 4 with Lysa's murder, I think they would have needed to do at least the chapter that was moved from ADWD in season 5; but I'm starting to think that they'll do a lot of TWOW material with her the next year.
Â 
Personally, I think that they figured, knowing the basics of her storyarc, and possibly having read some of Sansa's TWOW chapters (if GRRM has written multiple Sansa chapters already) that she has a big storyline coming up and they decided they needed to start her storyline earlier instead of cramming it later on.

We already know what happened to Tyrion/Shae and Robb/Jeyne. You're suggesting a LF/Sansa relationship would be a "change" from the books, when you have no idea what will happen beyond ADWD and can't come up with a single compelling argument why a consensual LF/Sansa love relationship could never happen.
I mean, I'd love proof that it could never happen, but creepiness and consensual love affairs are not mutually exclusive. As SanSan shippers are so fond of saying in relation to another relationship, it might be creepy, but pretty much everything is in this series. Abuse victims fall in love with their abusers. Rape victims fall in love with their rapists. Captives fall in love with their captors. Patrons marry their sex slaves and it's treated as romantic. And so on.

First I feel the need to say, I genuinly hope that the show makes it as clear as it was in the books how uncomfortable Sansa is with LF's kisses. I'm merely voicing concerns.
Â 
Also I absolutely did not mean they would start sleeping together (because  ) or that they would be free equal partners (because they obviously are not, she is his prisoner). I merely meant the showrunners might make it look like she likes him, or they will keep it ambiguous how she feels. Because they will get exciting will they/won't they 'intrigue' ,Â  sappy 'romantic' moments  and finally shock value when they go to book canon like nothing happened .Â 
Â 
And of course I'm always hoping they stick as close to the source material as they can, because I love the books. Especially Sansa's arc.

Â 
I guess we can keep our eyes peeled for a Sansa/Alayne chapter dump in the weeks leading up to Season 5's release...assuming TWOW isn't released by then, and a TWOW release pre-April 2015, as awesome as it would be, is looking unlikely. I'd thought until the last few eps aired that Season 6 would be the first seasons that would really get into TWOW material, but it's looking increasingly likely that Season 5 will be the season where the show officially passes the books...for at least a few characters, anyway. I find it an exciting and a terrifying prospect.
Â 
Maybe it's only the relatively pokey pacing of Seasons 2 and 3, but I've gotten the sense in Season 4 that the writers are really cooking with gas and moving full speed ahead. I stated on another thread that it seems like in this season the writers are really not fucking around: they're tying up loose ends left and right, they're even less bothered with mystery, subtlety and ambiguity than they were before (making it immediately crystal clear who killed Joffrey), they're resolving mysteries (one of the writers stated in a recent interview that Syrio was dead...no teasing, no hinting, just boom, dead), they're fairly bludgeoning us with post-ADWD foreshadowing, and they are plunging into AFFC/ADWD where certain characters are concerned. Maybe it's the possibility of only having seven seasons to finish this thing, or maybe it's the result of whatever GRRM told the writers in that meeting in the spring of 2013 (around when they were writing Season 4), but this season, I get the feeling that the writers are really gearing up to forge ahead into TWOW territory sooner rather than later and damn the torpedoes.
Â 
I know this prospect might give a lot of book fans the vapours, but I'm not nearly so particular. Then again, I'm very doubtful the series will ever be finished by GRRM, so...
Â

4262	Le Cygne	2014-05-20	Ages, she's between 15 and 16 on the show (more than two years have passed and she started the show after her 13th birthday), she's legal to do what she wants sexually in much of Western Europe at 15, and the rest of Europe and most of the US at 16. But I don't see how the modern context is relevant to the discussion. Sansa isn't the reader's daughter or sister or niece or whatever, she's a warg living in a fantasy world, complete with dragons, and an author who sets ages for sexuality very young, and doesn't shy away from large age gaps.In Westeros, her age isn't the problem with the kiss, it's that she's Littlefinger's captive. She's got no choice, he's murdered two people in cold blood right in front of her, threatened her, shown no respect for her as a person, and is responsible for the misery and death of her whole family, not to mention the price on her head that limits her options drastically. If she's not afraid, she's stupid. Take your pick. I don't think book Sansa is stupid. She's doing the smartest thing, biding her time, gaining his trust, surviving, and learning to navigate her world.I don't want to get into all the word parsing of how a blush means she digs Littlefinger (for an example of what a Sansa blush means, look at the forced wedding, she blushes and the text says that means she is "mortified"). I've seen the "evidence" and am not impressed. Moreover, she's focusing on kissing another guy. Not exactly the thing to do when you want someone else. And we know at least as far as the latest chapter, she wants to get away from Littlefinger. When Bronze Yohn comes, two things come to mind for her, the Hound, and Winterfell, and that = she wants to beg him to protect her from Littlefinger, but she's afraid.Now if someone were to come along that she does trust without reservation (Sandor, her brothers, her sister, Brienne perhaps)... Or if she finds a way out of her mess herself... (I'm partial to the second option myself...)

But, then again, we have the previous Sansa reaction to Robin's idea of placing a Moon Door in the actual Winterfell. In other words, if LF wants vengeance for Catelyn, why would anyone think Sansa doesn't want the same thing?
Â 
Â 
Oh she wants vengeance / justice; I just think show Sansa is thinking quicker than book Sansa and she is putting some of the pieces together, not totally there yet, but I think she's going to use him to get it and make him and others pay.

Yep, that's what I think they may do.Â  They take Sansa on dead ends and use her to prop up other characters because I don't think they find the character or her story very interesting, or they don't think the audience will for some reason.Â
4265	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-05-20	I think Sansa will kill Littlefinger (I'm guessing she will poison him or something) and when she does it she will say "what do we do to those that hurt the ones we love?" meaning her father.
4266	Le Cygne	2014-05-20	The Florian and Jonquil story parallels her previous belief that all knights were good, such as one might believe that cops are all good, only to find they are not, but still hope that there are some who will stand up and be counted. This is not childish.Â Yeah, they took away her songs, because they thought they were childish, but they weren't.Â  How did they miss that, who knows.Â  But they gutted her when they did that.Â  That line about real life being boring or whatever, that didn't sound like ASOS Sansa to me.Â  The point is, she's keeping this ideal of a better way (that's even in the hymn she sings) alive, how is that a bad thing?Â  It's not.Also, just remembering this, Old Nan is the one who told them the stories. Even Jon remembered. Old Nan is childish. Right. A Song of Ice and Fire. She plays the harp and sings. Someone else did, Rhaegar... He's childish, too.

Â 
Sansa's love of songs really couldn't have worked in the adaptation, at least once they decided to age her up from 11 to 13. The show's made a lot of changes I scratch my head over, but that particular change made perfect sense.

Â 
Seeing, again, as I have nothing to back-up my points besides circumstantial evidence and gut instinct, all I can say is that "they don't get her", "they don't like her, and "they can't convey her" are near identical interpretations of the same information and with ultimately the same outcome.
Â 
I'm torn. Â They can do subtle. Â They do it all the time. Â They've shown little ability to do subtle with Petyr or Sansa, however. Â On the other hand, an attempt to convey a subtle and complex relationship via the kiss has been met with significant viewer backlash that she should have been more obvious in how she pulled back, it wasn't clear enough, there should have been more resistance, etc., etc., etc. Â I had a foreign exchange film student friend tell me it's very American to need things like that spelled out. Â Maybe I should add a fourth to my list: "Audiences can't handle her."

4271	Asha's Suckling Babe	2014-05-20	I can see many posters have talked about the kiss and the slap but not much of the change in Robert's actions. I would have been less bothered by the slap (though it would be rather OOC for book!Sansa) if the scene would have otherwise played the same way. However the scenes in book and show give very different views of Sansa:
Â 
In the books I think there was some great symbolism in that scene, where Robert was a hostile threat attacking something dear to Sansa, her snow Winterfell. She fiercely responded to it by trying to seize his hand. This shows her being protective, and trying to stop an existing threat.
Â 
In the show the scene is completely different, Robert is trying to help Sansa improveÂ  Winterfell, with her permission, and he simply is too clumsy. And then she starts unreasonably blaming a child for what was clearly a mistake. (He doesn't start destroying it intentionally until after Sansa has unreasonably blamed him, and told him he has completely ruined it.) This shows her being unreasonably harsh and unforgiving, and being angry with someone who only tried to help her but failed.
Â 
Has a completely different feel to it, imo.

Â 
j/k, of course. I was upset in the moment that they had her so blatantly choose an accusatory word. Â My Sansa is still the lady armored in courtesy. Â I got over it when she made her embarrassed explanation to Petyr that she was trying to remember Winterfell. Â Then I remembered how emotional it was for her and let her have her lapse.
4273	Newstar	2014-05-20	I agree with everyone saying the slap was OOC for Book Sansa.

Â 
That's a good point. To be fair to Sansa, though, she was very sweet and friendly with Sweetrobin until he accidentally destroyed part of it. Her reaction was disproportionate, sure, especially given that Sweetrobin's a younger child, but she was trying.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Has a completely different feel to it, imo.
Â 
It was a little jarring to see Sansa going from lightly chatting to Sweetrobin to arguing with him heatedly, and that argument escalating into Sweetrobin destroying Winterfell in a rage and Sansa slapping him, since in the books Sweetrobin just came stomping over. It reminded me of the scene with Sansa and Joffrey at the Trident: it starts out all sweet and friendly with Joffrey eager to impress Sansa, and spirals down from there.

Why wouldn't that be consensual? Â Shae and Tyrion are consensual, Jamie and Cersei are consensual, Prince Oberyn and Ellaria are consensual. Â There's significant power and prestige differences in all those relationships.Â 


Unless you can show that the powerful half of any of those couples deliberately had three (count them) people murdered in front of their powerless partner, and deliberately incriminated their powerless partner in those murders so that there would be no safety for her anywhere except by slavishly doing whatever the powerful partner said, and the powerful partner openly threatens to kill anyone the powerless partner betrays him to (even inadvertently), AND the powerful partner demands the powerless partner think of him at all times as her father (a traditionally submissive and obedient role) AND at the same time abuses that submissive obedience by making ever more sexual demands that are taboo for a father to request - then all of those couples are VERY different from Sansa/LF.
Â 
IMO, the real comparison is a lot closer to Craster/Daughter (as Annara Snow mentioned)...which IMO can be considered consensual by NO stretch of the term.

Of course a lot of Americans don't need or want everything spelled out for them.
I think it was explicitly evident that she didn't consent to or enjoy the kiss. I don't see how anyone could look at it and think 'Yup, she was totally up for it'.

Â 
Agree TOTALLY on your better explanation for the point that I was making. Â Uh, but have you read the last thirteen pages re: the kiss? Â I don't get the controversy either, but I was thoroughly rebuked the last time I brought it up after reading some freak outs about it.
4278	juanml82	2014-05-20	Ages, she's between 15 and 16 on the show (more than two years have passed and she started the show after her 13th birthday), she's legal to do what she wants sexually in much of Western Europe at 15, and the rest of Europe and most of the US at 16. But I don't see how the modern context is relevant to the discussion. Sansa isn't the reader's daughter or sister or niece or whatever, she's a warg living in a fantasy world, complete with dragons, and an author who sets ages for sexuality very young, and doesn't shy away from large age gaps.
In Westeros, her age isn't the problem with the kiss, it's that she's Littlefinger's captive. She's got no choice, he's murdered two people in cold blood right in front of her, threatened her, shown no respect for her as a person, and is responsible for the misery and death of her whole family, not to mention the price on her head that limits her options drastically. If she's not afraid, she's stupid. Take your pick. I don't think book Sansa is stupid. She's doing the smartest thing, biding her time, gaining his trust, surviving, and learning to navigate her world.
I don't want to get into all the word parsing of how a blush means she digs Littlefinger (for an example of what a Sansa blush means, look at the forced wedding, she blushes and the text says that means she is "mortified"). I've seen the "evidence" and am not impressed. Moreover, she's focusing on kissing another guy. Not exactly the thing to do when you want someone else. And we know at least as far as the latest chapter, she wants to get away from Littlefinger. When Bronze Yohn comes, two things come to mind for her, the Hound, and Winterfell, and that = she wants to beg him to protect her from Littlefinger, but she's afraid.
Now if someone were to come along that she does trust without reservation (Sandor, her brothers, her sister, Brienne perhaps)... Or if she finds a way out of her mess herself... (I'm partial to the second option myself...)


Remember this thread is about the show character, not the book character. Show!Sansa hasn't met Bronze Yohn yet and we don't know how she'll react to him.

I'm not sure that they can do subtle. The actors can, the directors can, even the costume designers can. But D&D? I don't their part of the work (production, screenwritting and one episode per season) manage to successfully pull subtle stuff, nor the character's internal conflicts.
Â 


Yeah, I'm American and she seemed pretty grossed out to me. Look at her face:http://d1mxyp5ceukby...er-kiss-hbo.jpg


And yet that shot didn't make out of the editing room. The editor looked at it, D&D probably looked at it, the episode director might have looked at it, and they've decided against showing it.
And they did it for a reason.
4279	joachim	2014-05-20	She looked appropriately repulsed to me after it happened.
4280	Goldfinger	2014-05-20	Sansa enjoying that kiss for at least 10 seconds.

4282	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-21	When someone brought up an alliance between Sansa and Robin, it got me thinking. So...would it be possible that her line in the trailer about, "Lord Baelish has told many lies," isn't directed towards the Lords Declarant, but towards Robin (in a different scene)? Because I can imagine her saying that to Robin and then adding on, "Don't trust him, trust me." You guys think that would be possible? Well...I mean, ANYTHING is possible, so I guess I should say, is it likely? Or is she really just talking to the LD? Â
4283	ChromeWeasel	2014-05-21	LOL I always get a kick out of this forum. Â I've read the books multiple times, and have been a faithful watcher of the show from the beginning, and I just don't get the incredible butthurt over this scene. Â It seems that every single episode there is some irrelevant bit that they change that all the fans just completely lose their shit over. Â "OMG HE DIDN'T SAY ONLY CAT!!" Â So what? Â Good lord.
Â 
And one of you actually mentioned that this scene, this ONE SCENE, is the only thing that in your opinion makes the entire series worthwhile. Â I just don't get it. Â Here are the fundamentals of what is by all accounts a fairly standard GRRM murder scene:
Â 
1. Sansa stands in snow
2. Sansa builds Winterfell
3. Robin wrecks it
4. Littlefinger helps her rebuild it
5. They kiss
6. Lysa sees the kiss, goes apeshit
7. Littlefinger pushes her out the moon door, blames it on fop
Â 
I've read these books so many times and this particular scene never struck me as any kind of lynchpin. Â I mean there are so many massive scenes that they altered or just didn't do at all, that to fixate on this one strikes me as almost pathological.


Â 
Totally agree. I was just saying the same thing to my fiance about this. I've read the books several times. She's a viewer only. We both liked the scene.

Agreed. She kind of froze on the spot, but then pushed him away, and sounded pretty sincere when relaying that to Lysa.
4286	Newstar	2014-05-21	Sansa's body language in the still was different from Sansa's body language in what wound up airing, but after the Jaime/Cersei debacle, I have trouble attributing that to a deliberate choice on the part of the show. The stills usually match up with what airs in the show--or else the differences are so minor as to be unnoticeable--so the discrepancy sticks out.
Â 
I don't really see that the kiss itself is greatly different from the books. Book Sansa yields very briefly to the kiss before shoving Littlefinger off, as well. It's the elimination of everything after the kiss--Sansa losing her shit, Littlefinger coming on to her and offering to warm her hands, Sansa worried about being able to fend Petyr off and being "saved" by Sweetrobin interrupting them, etc.--that changes the flavour of the scene.
4287	juanml82	2014-05-21	No, that's a still.


Yes, but if Sophie Turner performed one, or more, shots with that body language, then that performance should have been recorded. And it was not used.

Well, the difference is that the Jaime/Cersei scene seems to have been a directing issue. In other words, it's possible that they didn't have any shot that would make it look consensual when they were cutting the episode. In this particular episode, it seemed they did have alternate shots that made it look non consensual. Now, performance might not be the only reason, or the reason at all, why they discarded it, but we need to remember that's a discarded shot, not the one who was actually used in the story.

But they clearly didn't understand that it came across as non-consensual, is the point.Â  So assuming that their use of this shot is meant to convey something different from the still is a rather shaky assumption.

Â 
Well, to me the in-episode version got across more or less the right message. Surprise followed by rejection. Not an immediate violent denial, sure, but that seems a bit tricksy with Petyr 'I poison people for hitting you, imagine what I do to someone who annoys me' Littlefinger.
4290	Ser Not Appearing	2014-05-21	Â 
Yes and yes. I dunno. I should have seen this coming, as Sweetrobin's actor was not all that young even in Season 1, and that was filmed back in 2010, but eliminating the mother/son angle to Sansa and Sweetrobin's relationship really diminishes it. No shade on Sweetrobin's actor--he's fine except for his age--but they really should have recast with someone younger for Sweetrobin's return in Season 4.Intetesting. I actually see show Sweetrobin as perfectly fine. One of the better child actors as well, imo, but age-wise I don't have many gripes. I think it would work out fine... unless he ages like Bran.
4291	Annara Snow	2014-05-21	Maybe Sansa will witness SR having a seizure in episode 10, if he does not play a significant role in episode 8, revealing his illness to the audience and maybe leading to a conversation about his health and possible death. 
I don't see why Sansa could not have a motherly relationship with him. Lino looks too old? Well, everyone has been going on about how adult Sophie looks, so that should level out. More importantly, SR acts younger than his age, even in the books where he's 8, it's one of his defining characteristics. I'd love to see him ask Sansa if, since they presumably aren't going to be betrothed now, she could be his mother.
4292	juanml82	2014-05-21	Well,  show!SR sleeping with show!sansa would have a different  tone than in the books

Â 
I really do think Sansa's final scene this season is:
Â 
"Are you my mother now Alayne?"
"Yes, IÂ suppose IÂ am."
Â 
It would perfectly fit with the whole children thing.Â

I think something akin to that would be a good final scene, though since Robin knows who she is, I don't see that he would start calling her "Alayne" now.

Maybe, but he knows she's his cousin and betrothed.
Â 

LOL He doesn't have to be sleeping in the same bed with her for her to be his "mom".

Nah, he doesn't have to sleep in the same bed for that. Actually, in a normal relationship, I'd say boys that old living sleeping with their mothers it's not a good thing. Then again, this is ASOIAF/GoT. "Normal relationships" need not to apply.
Â 
As for the kiss, I think both Robin and Tommen are in an, well... creepy? weird? something else? position. They both betrothed to hot young women, both are at the brink of puberty - if they aren't there already and, legally, they have a position of power over them. Robin has entitlement issues which Tommen, so far, doesn't.
As I said, I've given up trying to determine the characters ages. I don't even know if they are supposed to be consistent. But I wonder if D&D are going to tackle those characters nascent sexuality or if they are going to ignore it completely and pretend they are still 9-10 years old infants.
Â 
Oh, here's an interview with Sophie Turner/reporters defense of Sansa. Many of the things there have been discussed in this forum many times, and some seem to apply only to the books (she did kneel at her wedding in the show).http://www.tvguide.c...sa-1081921.aspx
My favorite quote of the interview
Â 
Â 

She put on a polite smile and bided her time. So don't be fooled by her complaisant demeanor. Just because she might not recite her hit list every night, doesn't mean she isn't as strong or determined as Arya. She's simply better at hiding it.
"That's why people should fear Sansa more than Arya I think, because no one knows what Sansa's thinking. And it's all up in here," Turner says, tapping her head. "People don't know that she wants to go around killing everyone. She would love to be Arya for a day just killing everyone, but she can't because she knows that would just get her killed quicker."

They're not technically betrothed, since she's still married.
4299	juanml82	2014-05-21	They're not technically betrothed, since she's still married.


True, but Robin already speaks of "when we're married", so so far he's certain he'll end up banging her sometime in the future.
4300	Chebyshov	2014-05-21	Oh, here's an interview with Sophie Turner/reporters defense of Sansa. Many of the things there have been discussed in this forum many times, and some seem to apply only to the books (she did kneel at her wedding in the show).
http://www.tvguide.c...sa-1081921.aspx


Â 
This interview is the tits. Sophie really hits the nail on the head when it comes to interpreting Sansa:
Â 
Â 
Instead of fighting her captor when the odds were against her, Sansa used the only weapon she had. "Courtesy is a lady's armor," Turner says, quotingÂ A Song of Ice and Fire. Everything Sansa has endured destroyed the idealistic ingA©nue she once was, but Sansa strategically continued to play the part to assure her survival. She never forgot a 'thank you' or curtsy, even when surrounded by the people who brutally slaughtered her father, mother, brother and unborn niece or nephew.
Â 
"That's why she's one of the most intelligent characters on the show I think. She adapts so well and she has this thing where she's probably the greatest actor out of all of them," Turner says. "She deceives with the faA§ade of her former self and that's what's great. She never breaks face of this innocent naAve girl and she's not that."

Â 
They're not going to remain betrothed after Lysa's death, since it's not a part of LF's plan, unless D&D are completely changing that storyline... which would be a bad idea, but you never know with them.
Â 
I mean, I'm not one of the people who think so low of them that they would make the completely absurd, mind-bogglingly awful changes that fandom comes up with, such as "Yara will become fArya"  but this is not as bad as that, and I wouldn't put it past them to make moderately awful changes, especially to Sansa's story.
4302	Colonel Green	2014-05-21	While we don't know precisely what's coming next with Sansa's story, I rather doubt that keeping Sansa engaged to Robin would ever work as a substitution, since that's already been accomplished and Littlefinger would have no reason to kill Robin in that scenario.

Â 
Which is what I'm saying. I'm just considering the "D&D will make stupid changes just for the sake of it/in order not to have to cast more characters"* possibility. I was under the impression that juanml82 believed it, since he seems to think that Robin and Sansa will still be engaged, which is obviously not the case in the books, because LF has other plans.

4304	Newstar	2014-05-21	I am curious about where the cutoff point will be for Sansa's arc this season. End of Sansa I in AFFC, maybe? That leaves only two Sansa chapters left, both of which could be covered off in one episode apiece. To me, that suggests four options:
1. The writers throw in a non-book plot to kill time (Bran's stint at Craster's)
2. The writers stretch out a thin bit of material over several episodes with lots of non-book fillery conversation scenes (Tyrion and Cersei in Season 3, Arya and the Hound in Season 4)
3. The writers keep to the material but radically cut down on Sansa's screentime (Bran in Season 4, as he only appears in four episodes)
4. Season 5 gets into Sansa's arc in TWOW in a big way
I favour option 4 for obvious reasons, but I just don't know what the writers will do.

And his plan is:
Slowly poison the actual, and manageable, Lord of the Vale (maybe)
	Expend a lot of money in purchasing Lady Waynwood's debts
	Arrange with Lady Waynwood the betrothal of his bastard daughter to the heir apparent of the Vale. Even if Anya knows she's Sansa (quite a risk to tell her), she'll appear to be betrothing the heir apparent of the Vale to a bastard.
	Reveal Sansa Stark at the wedding?
	Kill the Lord of the Vale and make it look like disease so Sansa becomes the Lady of the Vale?
	Kill the New Lord of the Vale so he can marry Sansa?
Â 
Yeah, reducing all that to
Sansa continues to be engaged to the spoiled, but able, Lord of the Vale
	Reveal Sansa Stark at the wedding?
	Kill the Lord of the Vale and make it look like disease so Sansa becomes the Lady of the Vale?
	Kill the New Lord of the Vale so he can marry Sansa?
is a stupid change 
What do we loose? The actual character assassination of HtH, a character we've never met?
Sansa's reluctance to political marriages, which didn't appear when Lysa told her she'd get into one and which we don't know which dramatical impact will have?
It's necessary in the books because SR is not fit to be a charismatic leader and, should LF need the Lord of the Vale to get Sansa pregnant soon, SR is not up to the task. But neither of those are true in the books. And we should keep in mind that GRRM original plan might have been to betroth and maybe marry Sansa to SR, since with the five years gap, SR would have been able to consummate the marriage and the relationship between LF, Sansa and SR would have turned creepy and seudo-incestuous in a very ASOIAF way.

Â 
Well, of course, you're right. It's just one of the most important things to Sansa's character development, but Sansa's character development and characterization in general is so unimportant, we can't have the show waste time on such trifles...

Sansa's reluctance to marry HtH comes in her last chapter so, without access to the TWOW draft, we can not even know how it will impact her character

development. Even more, the reluctance is to political marriages, not to HtH in particular, so Sansa's reluctance, if the show wants to show it, can very well come into conflict with a betrothal with SR.

4309	Colonel Green	2014-05-21	What do we loose?


The plot, for one thing.Â  Moreover, there would be no point in killing Robin in this version; in fact, it would be counterproductive, because Sansa wouldn't have any authority in the Vale once he was dead.Â  Thus you lose what would appear to be a major plot catalyst.
Â

Ah interesting, thanks!
4314	Newstar	2014-05-21	Hmm...that bit from GRRM seems to imply we will meet Harry in a POV, as opposed to hearing all about him but never meeting him (similar to Willas back in ASOS).
Spoilers for TWOW:
	Spoiler Izembaro turned out to be a minor character, somewhere on the level of the Sailor's Wife, although I suppose that could change. Will Harry, mentioned in the same breath in the email, turn out to be equally minor?
4315	Colonel Green	2014-05-21	Was Sansa supposed to spend five years in the Vale after Lysa's death, and was LF informing Sansa of the marriage contract meant to mark the first events post time skip?


Considering that Izembaro was meant to appear in Arya's first post-gap chapter, and Sansa's comparatively short story in AFFC basically moved her into the story launch position, I think that's probably what would have happened.
Â 
Another reason I expect them to keep the Harry the Heir plot is that they bothered to cast Lady Waynwood.Â  If they were cutting Harry, there's really no need for her.Â  Royce and Corbray are the only ones needed for the Lords Declarant story, specifically, and they certainly haven't cast Templeton, Hunter, Redfort and Belmore, as far as we know.

Good point about Harry. Regarding SR's death, it depends on how, when and if LF wants him dead:
The first thought are that LF wants to kill SR. But, this is not necessarily the case. He might be convinced he's going to die young and is planning accordingly.
The second thought is that LF wants to kill SR before Sansa's wedding. But that's actually counterproductive to him: If SR dies before Alayne/Sansa gets married to HtH, LF is no longer Lord Protector and Harry the Heir will be the one selecting a regent, if he doesn't want to start ruling himself, despite his age. So it actually benefits LF if SR is alive by the time of the wedding.
And if the last point is truth, then LF will still try to kill SR after the wedding, likely after Sansa gets pregnant. Now, the question is how would the show present the "when SR dies" but the catch is, Show!Robin isn't (so far) a sickly kid, so there is no reason for anyone to believe that he'll die young.
Â 
In other words, unless he does something very important, Harry the Heir can be cut from the show with little consequence. Whether they'll do it or not is another matter. After all, Anya Waynwood has been cast.

No, it wasn't.Â  He talked about Harry before the gap was abandoned. And in terms of "the Sansa of it", two major things about LF'S "gift" in the last Alayne chapter are: 1) the fact that his plan to supposedly give her Winterfell depends on the death of an annoying but helpless and sick child who relies on Sansa; and 2) the fact that it involves a political marriage to a handsome young knight/heir, something that Sansa would have been delighted with when we first met her (and that Littlefinger seems to think would still delight her), without even realizing that said prince or knight is a douche; while the present Sansa is both unlikely to be taken by handsome douchey young knights, and sick and tired of being auctioned off for her claim to various political marriages, which is a major theme in ASOS,  from her forced marriage to Tyrion to her disillusionment with the Tyrells to her feelings about her aunt telling her she has to marry SR, and leads to her attitude to marriage in AFFC. 
One has to be really, really disinterested in Sansa as a character and in her story and development to think that this kind of change would be a good idea in any way.

4319	The Reader Lisa	2014-05-21	To people who think the "Only Cat" controversy is lame, why make the change toÂ  "Your sister" in the first place?
Because the Unsullied won't remember who Cat is? So you have LF or Lysa refer to her that way in preceding
dialogue. A couple of words at most. No expensive sets, costumes, horses or extras necessary. A tiny bit of
writing. And "Your sister" isn't a once-off but the latest in a long list of disappointing rewrites done for the sake
of, well,.....disappointing book fans. I'm sorry, but that's how it seems to me; that they enjoy ruining parts of the
books that people especially love and look forward to seeing brought to life. They remind me of Lucy holding
the football for Charlie Brown. Oh, you like this part, do you? YANK!!!!

One has to be really, really disinterested in Sansa as a character and in her story and development to think that this kind of change would be a good idea in any way.


1) It's true that the HtH plan puts Sansa in a moral bind: for Harry to lead the armies of Vale, it's convenient that SR is dead. The quick and simple answer is that the show can replace that moral issue with something else. After all, Sansa is pretty much making a deal with the devil. I see two issues here: do you see Sansa agreeing or accepting the death of SR? Because if she doesn't, it's a moot point. And if it that's what makes her turn against LF, that's also easily replaced with something else. The issue, I think, is what happens if TWOW Book!Sansa will be turning a blind eye to SR's death. If that was to happen (which I doubt you'll believe), then I'd agree the show will have a hard time adapting that without HtH. Unfortunately, I also think that the show would chicken out of such a development anyway, just like Show!Tyrion doesn't kill a singer or Show!Robb invades the Westerlands but doesn't order his troops to sack the region.
Â 
2) Nothing of that is present in the show (and HtH as douche isn't in the books either). Instead of wondering if she could make Loras love her by giving him sons, she wonders if her family would be at the wedding. So it's likely that it won't be introduced in the show either, independently of whether HtH is cast or not. And if she's supposed to act reticent to the marriage in TWOW and that's important enough for the plot that the show has to include it, they can make her oppose the marriage for any other set of reasons.

Like...because she's still married? That's a point they're apparently hammering home because even in "Mockingbird", she continues to wear her wedding ring (I noticed it on a rewatch of when Lysa summons her to the Moon Door).
Â 
...AND she's still wearing it when she speaks to the LD's (?!?!?!?!?!)

Well, we can guess Sansa's wont be able to just play the "already married" card in TWOW - if she wants to postpone the marriage indefinitely, that is. It may be that she ends up accepting. The show could just, as you say, play the "already married" card. As for the ring, there are no wedding rings in Westeros. While it lampshades her marital status to viewers, it doesn't say "married woman" to the characters in the story. In-story, it's just a fancy ring.
4323	El Guapo	2014-05-22	Margeary and Cersei wear rings as well. You can clearly see them when they are talking during Tommen's coronation.
4324	Petyr Patter	2014-05-22	Margeary and Cersei wear rings as well. You can clearly see them when they are talking during Tommen's coronation.


Â 
Lots of people wear rings, the question is whether those rings are (like today in Western Civilization) widely recognized as symbols of matrimony.Â  The show has presented no evidence one way or another.Â  Also, I don't think the ring has ever been specifically highlighted.Â  What we could have is a costume decision being made separately from script and production.Â 
Â 
Maybe Sansa just likes jewelry?
4325	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-22	I just re-watched the episode and something caught my attention.
Â 
LF says, "to build a new home, you need to tear the old one down" (paraphrasing)
Â 
I think it's curious that he said it right before Sansa asked him why he killed Joffrey. And I think that's exactly why LF arranged the Purple Wedding: not to avenge Cat, but because he's tearing down his previous "home", the Lannister regime, to build his own kingdom, base, whatever you want to call it, starting with the North (Sansa), the Vale (Harry the Heir) and the Riverlands (LF himself)
4326	grufolo	2014-05-22	I have not read the previous thread, but i have always wondered if and where to find discussions on one of my favourite theories:
Is Sansa the only Stark child to face a different destiny?
All the children of Ned still have a redeemable relationship with their direwolf, but Sansa (unless Lady comes backfrom the dead, that is).
I think this is the perfect premise for a major difference between her and the others. Will she be the one to rule in the North? Will shebe the one to betray the others and their family? I guess something THIS major.
Any feedback?

I have my own prediction for Sansa, which if you are interested you can find by clicking the LannStark link in my signature.
Â 
That being stated, I think the Stark children are all different, but share a lot of similar parallels with the exception of Robb.Â  They are all currently isolated, all desire a return to their family, and all are currently being "mentored."Â  Well, we don't know what is going on with Rickon, but Sansa, Bran, and Arya are all definitely receiving lessons, albeit in completely different things.
Â 
So, no, I don't think Sansa is "different" from her other siblings, at least not in things the other Starks have in common.Â

Â 
Maybe Sansa just likes jewelry?
Â 
Here are my problems with Sansa's ring:
Â 
1. Wedding rings do not seem to be a thing in Westeros. There are several female married characters in Westeros who do not wear wedding rings: Talisa, Catelyn, etc.
2. Women and, heck, even men wear rings on their ring fingers that are not wedding rings (Lysa wears a big ring on her ring finger both before and after marrying Littlefinger, Tyrion wears that big lion-shaped ring on his ring finger, etc.).
3. In spite of #1 and #2, Sansa is not wearing that ring at any point before her wedding to Tyrion in 3x08, and the first time it's seen on her finger is at the Sansa/Tyrion wedding feast, meaning she must have acquired it at some point between the beginning of the wedding ceremony and the wedding feast, which seems odd if it isn't meant to be a wedding ring.
4. If it is a wedding ring--which to be fair has never been stated definitively--I don't get why 1) Sansa wouldn't chuck it at the first available opportunity after leaving KL and 2) why Littlefinger would not require her to ditch it before arriving in the Vale as "Alayne."
5. If it isn't a wedding ring and is just meant to be a piece of jewelry, I still don't get why Sansa wouldn't chuck it at the first available opportunity, as it's a very "Lannister" ring (gaudy, in Lannister colours), and one would think she wouldn't want any reminders of her association with them.
Â 
Could just be that the props people shit the bed--just as the costume department did when Sansa somehow conjured her Blackwater dress out of nowhere to wear to the Eyrie when she escaped KL with the clothes on her back--but that big-ass ring is infuriatingly impossible to ignore. I thought the writers came up with the idea of the ring in the first place to mark her transformation from Sansa to Alayne when she ditches it, or maybe to have a triumphant scene on the ship after escaping KL where she throws it away, but now, I dunno. It could just be that the writers wanted a constant reminder that Sansa is married, as TeamLemonCakeBraavos suggested, but do the writers really think that the TV audience is so stupid that they couldn't remember that on their own? It's not as if the show isn't already peppered with references to Tyrion as Sansa's husband and Sansa as Tyrion's wife. On the other hand, the writers did swap out "Only Cat" for "Your sister," so...

4331	lojzelote	2014-05-22	I think that Sansa got the ring because as a Lannister woman she had to display the family's wealth, but the ring as such is not necessary a symbol of allegiance, if it makes any sense. The Lannisters are certainly not the only family in the realm allowed to wear rubies and gold.
Â 
As for not getting rid off the Lannister gift, IIRC not even in the books she extends her hatred of the Lannisters towards her new womanly gown; true, the gown is in the Stark colors, but then again, personally I find the whole business with "family colors" a bit stupid. Do the Starks dress only in white and gray? If yes, then I pity the previous generations because with their complexion, they must have looked awfully washed-out and bland.

4332	Newstar	2014-05-22	Fair enough, but the ring is just so visually distracting, especially in those close-ups of Lysa clutching Sansa's hands. All of Sansa's other jewelry except for maybe the Lannister pendant she wore in Season 1--the dragonfly necklace, the butterfly choker, even the PW necklace--has been unobtrusive and delicate, whereas that gold ring is all "Look at how freaking big and shiny this ring is." As much as I'm sure that TV Sansa loves pretty things as much as her book self, the ring isn't even her style. That it's so obviously a Lannister ring--looks a lot like Cersei's rings (big, gold, flamboyant)--adds insult to injury.

5. If it isn't a wedding ring and is just meant to be a piece of jewelry, I still don't get why Sansa wouldn't chuck it at the first available opportunity, as it's a very "Lannister" ring (gaudy, in Lannister colours), and one would think she wouldn't want any reminders of her association with them.


A woman, getting rid of jewelery? Heresy!

Like...because she's still married? That's a point they're apparently hammering home because even in "Mockingbird", she continues to wear her wedding ring (I noticed it on a rewatch of when Lysa summons her to the Moon Door).
Â 
...AND she's still wearing it when she speaks to the LD's (?!?!?!?!?!)


Â 
Because all that matters is the plot, right? Who cares about the characters and their motivations, and the actual themes of the story...
Â 
I mean, the story of a girl who feels totally bound by her a marriage that was forced on her on her captors and that was never a real marriage, because she's, I guess, a staunch believer in the sanctity of marriage vows, even forced ones, would be totally the same as the story of a girl who considers her forced marriage a mockery and doesn't want to ever get married because she's sick and tired of everyone trying to marry her because of her claim rather than for love, so she's going to use the "I'm still married" card to try to avoid it? That's exactly the same story, riight?

I don't even understand what you're trying to say. In the event that you actually wish to further the conversation, please speak clearly...without sarcasm and haughtiness. Good grief. You're impossible to talk too.
Â 
In any event, my constant emphasis on the ring is because at this point, she supposed to be pretending to be someone else. She is not married with a giant Lannister ring on her finger; she's a bastard niece (daughter) of Petyr who is now engaged to Robin, and if they keep the plotline the same as the book, will be engaged to Harry (I would think it not appropriate to wear a wedding ring in front of Lady Waynwood). Furthermore, that she still has this ring and WEARS it (when she is under no obligation to do so)...from a family she despises and to a husband she loathes (in the book, because in the show, they wrote that relationship much warmer and cordial), is 'weird' to me. Either this is a massive "dropped ball" on behalf of the props department or it actually means something to HER storyline.
Â 
As a side, no. Sansa didn't wear that ring before she was married. Matter of fact, I don't even recall her wearing rings before she was married. That's a wedding ring; a wedding ring fully decked out in Lannister colors and everything. So, can we not pretend its just 'jewelry' she likes to wear?
4341	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-22	Â 
Here are my problems with Sansa's ring:
Â 
1. Wedding rings do not seem to be a thing in Westeros. There are several female married characters in Westeros who do not wear wedding rings: Talisa, Catelyn, etc.
2. Women and, heck, even men wear rings on their ring fingers that are not wedding rings (Lysa wears a big ring on her ring finger both before and after marrying Littlefinger, Tyrion wears that big lion-shaped ring on his ring finger, etc.).
3. In spite of #1 and #2, Sansa is not wearing that ring at any point before her wedding to Tyrion in 3x08, and the first time it's seen on her finger is at the Sansa/Tyrion wedding feast, meaning she must have acquired it at some point between the beginning of the wedding ceremony and the wedding feast, which seems odd if it isn't meant to be a wedding ring.
4. If it is a wedding ring--which to be fair has never been stated definitively--I don't get why 1) Sansa wouldn't chuck it at the first available opportunity after leaving KL and 2) why Littlefinger would not require her to ditch it before arriving in the Vale as "Alayne."
5. If it isn't a wedding ring and is just meant to be a piece of jewelry, I still don't get why Sansa wouldn't chuck it at the first available opportunity, as it's a very "Lannister" ring (gaudy, in Lannister colours), and one would think she wouldn't want any reminders of her association with them.
Â 
Could just be that the props people shit the bed--just as the costume department did when Sansa somehow conjured her Blackwater dress out of nowhere to wear to the Eyrie when she escaped KL with the clothes on her back--but that big-ass ring is infuriatingly impossible to ignore. I thought the writers came up with the idea of the ring in the first place to mark her transformation from Sansa to Alayne when she ditches it, or maybe to have a triumphant scene on the ship after escaping KL where she throws it away, but now, I dunno. It could just be that the writers wanted a constant reminder that Sansa is married, as TeamLemonCakeBraavos suggested, but do the writers really think that the TV audience is so stupid that they couldn't remember that on their own? It's not as if the show isn't already peppered with references to Tyrion as Sansa's husband and Sansa as Tyrion's wife. On the other hand, the writers did swap out "Only Cat" for "Your sister," so...


Â 
THIS. 
Â 


Fair enough, but the ring is just so visually distracting, especially in those close-ups of Lysa clutching Sansa's hands. All of Sansa's other jewelry except for maybe the Lannister pendant she wore in Season 1--the dragonfly necklace, the butterfly choker, even the PW necklace--has been unobtrusive and delicate, whereas that gold ring is all "Look at how freaking big and shiny this ring is."

I'm trying to say exactly what I said, in at least three posts already including that one. That characters are the core of the story, not the bare plot; you can't just have the same plot but give the characters completely different motivations and ignore their development and present them as different people, without producing a fundamentally different story. Which is what Juan seems to think:
Â 

1) And if she's supposed to act reticent to the marriage in TWOW and that's important enough for the plot that the show has to include it, they can make her oppose the marriage for any other set of reasons.
Â 
Â 

Which is the idea that I'm opposing here. You seemed to agree with him, stating that Sansa could just oppose the marriage because she's already married?!
Â 
Â 


Â 
Like...because she's still married? That's a point they're apparently hammering home because even in "Mockingbird", she continues to wear her wedding ring (I noticed it on a rewatch of when Lysa summons her to the Moon Door).

Â 
Â 
Do you really think that they could just make Sansa oppose the marriage out of some belief in the sanctity of (forced) marriage vows, rather than because she hates being made to marry people who just want her for her claim, regardless of how she feels about it; and that this would be the same story about the same character?
Â 
I'm sorry if you find it "arrogant and haughty" but it's a little difficult to be patient with people who, like Juan, keep ignoring my points and going on about the "plot" with Sansa being just a prop to push the plot along. It's even worse when others decide to ignore the same points and insist on speculating on the ways that the show could push the "plot" forward while completely changing Sansa's characterization, without even addressing the concept that main characters do matter and aren't just props for the plot. Oh, I guess I am arrogant and haughty because I'm annoyed when people completely ignore the very obvious issue I've been bringing up for several posts. Fine. But I think it should be really clear what I'm trying to say. I've said it in at three posts not counting this one, in very straightforward terms. What exactly do you find so hard to understand?

Â 
It's similar to the case of Sansa's dragonfly finery, really. Many people speculated how it is thematically connected to Duncan the Small, the Prince of the Dragonflies, and it foreshadows that Sansa will choose love and quiet life over power and titles. I think it is quite possible that Sansa will make such a choice in future, but please don't tell me there's any connection between Duncan and the costume. Especially not since such things like in the books non-existent King Orys (or was it Onys?) are included.

Maybe it will come up in 4x08 or 4x10, in the way that little show details sometimes become clearer down the road, in an "Ahhhhhh, that's what they were going for" sort of way, or maybe the ring will just disappear discreetly at some point, possibly between seasons.
I dunno that I would call the ring subtle, though. The design is all "Hey, check out this bomb-ass bling." It's impossible to ignore, especially in the lemon cakes scene where the camera lovingly follows Sansa's ring hand conveying cakes to her mouth, or lingers on Lysa gripping Sansa's hands.

Â 


Â 
Oh no. I don't know anything about Sansa honoring "forced marriage vows", and I'm not sure if that's what my comment read as, but its not why I agreed with Juan. I took it that he was suggesting she would use her pre-existing marriage to get out of any future marriages that she is not inclined to participate in. That strategy actually works very well with her characterization in the book. She doesn't want to be forced into another marriage....so hey, why not use the very real and VALID excuse that she can't actually be married to someone else when she's currently still married to Tyrion. That's not her being a "prop" to anyone else, that's simply a matter of fact. People can try to engage her to anyone they want, but unless Tyrion dies, her marriage to whomever (if it were to actually come to pass) wouldn't be valid.
Â 
The ring--to bring that back up--is a very visual representation of that reality in my opinon, although, at this point, I'm just confused about it all together. See, I keep operating under the assumption (real or not) that they're writing both Sansa and her storyline with the future in mind (a future that goes beyond AFFC). So, I look at the fact that they made no attempts to hide her identity (by dying her hair), that Robin knows who she is, and that she's still wearing the wedding ring....and in isolation, those things mean nothing. Taken together, I'm convinced that they have to mean something, even if I'm confused as fuck about WHAT.
4349	Newstar	2014-05-22	And the show has used jewelry, not so much in a portending the character's future sort of way, but to tell us things about the characters the way their clothes do: the Lannisters love big, flashy rings because it's a show of wealth and power, Dany wears a little collar type necklace to show solidarity with the slaves (from some or other featurette), and so on. That's why Sansa's ring was so great: it was so obviously a Lannister ring, and whether a wedding ring or not, clearly marked her as their property..which makes the fact that she's still wearing it all the more mystifying.

4353	Le Cygne	2014-05-22	I searched a while on several terms, apart from a couple Tyrion/Sansa shippers on tumblr, nobody is talking about the ring. Sansa has worn rings before, big ones, too. I doubt she's feeling sentimental about Tyrion, since both actors have said she doesn't love him, and he doesn't love her.Â If there was a chance anyone would connect marriage and a ring, I doubt she'd be wearing it, since she's got a price on her head.Â As far as the costumers, they were trying to show this:Â "Wedding days should be a joyous event for the bride, but, unfortunately, Sansa's being forced into a marriage that she doesn't want, into the Lannister family. For this dress, Michelle wanted it to be a confined, restricted bodice shape with bare, vulnerable arms. She wanted an embroidered band that would wrap around the bodice and tell Sansa's life story."Obviously we imagined that the wedding dress has been commissioned by Cersei and the Lannisters for Sansa, and so the embroidery would have come from Cersei's mind. We guessed that it wouldn't be romantic or lovely and girly and pretty with dainty flowers, but a real strong message of dominance, saying that we own you now, Sansa."http://www.scpr.org/...-costumes-intr/

As surely as the wedding dress is specifically designed to mark her as Lannister property, so too does that ring, by its design and colouring, mark Sansa as Lannister property, even if it's not a wedding ring. She's first seen wearing it at the wedding feast, no coincidence there. Just as we'd find it strange if Sansa was strolling around the Eyrie in a flashy, lion-embroidered red and gold gown, especially once she starts with her Alayne cover, so too is it really strange to be wearing the jewelry equivalent of that kind of dress, even if it isn't a wedding ring.
The show has also previously used Sansa's jewelry for character beats: Joffrey's gift necklace, which went AWOL except for a brief reappearance at Sansa's wedding once Sansa realized the truth about him. They have attended to that kind of detail before and have used it to make a point about the character, so why wouldn't the same Sansa who ditched her Joffrey necklace once he betrayed her so brutally ditch her Lannister ring the moment she's finally free of them, a ring she acquired the same day of her horrible wedding that even if not a wedding ring would be a terrible reminder of that day? 
It's either sloppiness--which is entirely possible, given the mysterious reappearance of the Blackwater dress--or a deliberate decision, and if indeed deliberate, it makes no sense to me whatsoever.

Sansa's characterization has been changed already. In the show she never expressed, so far, any negative thought about arranged marriages, be it with a yet to be introduced Harry the Heir, the already existing betrothal with Robin or any other marriage prospect.

Oh no. I don't know anything about Sansa honoring "forced marriage vows", and I'm not sure if that's what my comment read as, but its not why I agreed with Juan. I took it that he was suggesting she would use her pre-existing marriage to get out of any future marriages that she is not inclined to participate in. That strategy actually works very well with her characterization in the book. She doesn't want to be forced into another marriage....so hey, why not use the very real and VALID excuse that she can't actually be married to someone else when she's currently still married to Tyrion. That's not her being a "prop" to anyone else, that's simply a matter of fact. People can try to engage her to anyone they want, but unless Tyrion dies, her marriage to whomever (if it were to actually come to pass) wouldn't be valid.


My thoughts exactly, assuming she doesn't want to remarry in the show
4359	Le Cygne	2014-05-22	It's also interesting that the forced marriage to Tyrion may not be valid. Probably isn't.He keeps referring to Tysha as his wife in the present sense. "Mâ<U+0080><U+0099>lord would prefer his wife. Mâ<U+0080><U+0099>lord would prefer a girl named Tysha." He makes several comments like this.

Â 
Doesn't she already do this at the end of her final chapter in AFFC?Â 
Â 
"A marriage . . ." Her throat tightened. She did not want to wed again, not now, perhaps not ever. "I do not . . . I cannot marry. Father, I . . ." Alayne looked to the door, to make certain it was closed. "I am married," she whispered. "You know."
Â 
She is clearly not delighted at the prospect of getting married again. She starts with protesting, but decides to give a very valid reason. We don't get her full reaction to LF's plot and that is very deliberate on GRRM's part.Â

IÂ don't want them to be together, but with GRRM you never know what is up his sleeve. Besides, that quote just stuck out to me
4363	Le Cygne	2014-05-22	Tysha is who he's thinking about in terms of love and longing (also as his wife in the present tense), most of these are from the last book (all but the first one, I think)... Spoiler tagging for space and fixed the punctuation that got lost, sorry:Â 
	Spoiler That night, alone in his tower cell with a blank parchment and a cup of wine, Tyrion found himself thinking of his wife. Not Sansa; his first wife, Tysha....Â He would have taken the crossbow from my hands, as once he took Tysha from my arms....Â "Perhaps you might smuggle me out under your skirts? I'd be so grateful; why, I'll even wed you. I have two wives already, why not three? Ah, but where would we live?"...It reminded him of how Tysha would riffle his hair during the false spring of their marriage, before he helped his fathers guardsmen rape her....M'lord would prefer his wife. M'lord would prefer a girl named Tysha....Tyrion thought of Tysha. He glanced out at the fields where once the gods had walked....He remembered the first time with Tysha as well. She did not know how, no more than I did. We kept bumping our noses, but when I touched her tongue with mine she trembled....Not mine. I carry mine own sorrows with me, everywhere I go. He thought of Tysha and wondered where whores go. Why not Volantis? Perhaps Ill find her there. A man should cling to hope. He wondered what he would say to her. I am sorry that I let them rape you, love. I thought you were a whore. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me? I want to go back to our cottage, to the way it was when we were man and wife....His thoughts turned to Tysha, who had so briefly been his lady wife...."Wherever whores go," he said. And where is that? Tyrion wanted to ask him. Where did Tysha go, Father?...Selhorys may be where whores go. Tysha might be in there even now, with tears tattooed upon her cheek....There was only one such in the house, and she was not Tysha... "Do you know a woman by the name of Tysha?" he asked, as he watched his seed dribble out of her onto the bed. The whore did not respond. "Do you know where whores go?"...He wondered how much his father had hurt when the quarrel punched through his groin, what Shae had felt as he twisted the chain around her lying throat, what Tysha had been feeling as they raped her....Looking for his silver queen. Looking for Daenerys, willing the ship to sail faster. Well, I might do the same if Tysha waited in Meereen....And false. Sansa, Shae, all my women Tysha was the only one who ever loved me. Where do whores go?...Jaime, thought Tyrion. Shae. Tysha. My wife, I miss my wife, the wife I hardly knew.

4364	Woman of War	2014-05-22	The ambiguity is deliberate since Martin at that point of the story has no intention at all to give any hint about the future of Tyrion's emotional situation. 
And we are not there yet in the show, the Tysha tragedy has not yet been important again. And we so far have no idea how they intend to treat the Tysha topic, if Jaime will confess to Tyrion what he did, if Tysha will have that huge importance to Tyrion she, or better said her absence, her loss, has in ADWD.
Apart from that - the importance of Tysha to Tyrion does not have anything to do with the validity of that marriage. If, and I am convinced no error was allowed to happen here, Tywin successfully annulled the Tyrion/Tysha marriage, Tyrion will just as much mourn for his lost first wife. And yet the Sansa marriage would be valid even if Tyrion himself would want it otherwise in case there is ever a chance Tysha might return to him.
And Sansa can use her valid marriage just as much as protection against any other marriage plot, no matter if Tyrion misses her or not.
Apart from that, Le Cygne, you need not worry. I see no way storywise how Martin could have Sansa and Tyrion be together in the end as couple if the author has not made both characters want it for one or the other reason.

4365	Newstar	2014-05-22	Not sure why some of you want Tyrion and Sansa to be together, when neither wants the other, but...There's a difference between fans speculating about future events and actually desiring that particular outcome. Surely you can appreciate the distinction between thinking something might happen and wanting something to happen? I find certain pairings loathsome, but if I see something that hints at it, or if someone's argument against those pairings is weak, I'll gladly point it out, and most here will do the same. I spent a lot of words arguing unthread that it's possible that Sansa and LF might have a consensual love affair, and I can assure you that that's my nightmare scenario; I just don't see any slam dunk basis for ruling it out at this stage. It would be nice to rule it out because I find it distasteful, but I think it's important to keep one's personal feelings out of one's analysis. That's why shippers are so often completely off base about where their ships are headed: they're too emotionally involved to see straight (having witnessed some epic fandom meltdowns when ships turned out not to come to pass or to be endgame, I know whereof I speak).
If we all just clung to our desired ships/endgames/fiery deaths/crackpot theories of choice as foregone conclusions and stuck our fingers in our ears when anyone disagreed or put forward a different interpretation, there wouldn't be very much to talk about, then, would there?

Looking at those, a pattern emerges, he's got Tysha on his mind, but there are also hints he doesn't see the forced marriage as a real marriage.What motivates the characters is a good indication of what's to come in their stories. Character motivation drives plot.

Â 
And yet, we have more than enough proof to conclude that Tywin made an error. When discussing Tyrion/Sansa marriage and the possibility of the annulment, GRRM said that both parties must ask the permission of High Septon to do so. No third party could annul the marriage. Now, we know what happened and how Tywin put Tyrion's marriage under the rug as if it never happened. The marriage was never annulled, and that is why his marriage to Sansa can be so easily annulled. Plus, add the political scene and her virginity to that brawl and you see that the marriage can be so easily dismissed.

Minor point, he said that a party must request it, not both (which would be practical; a lot of annulments would be granted in cases of abandonment or whatever).
Â 
On the fine points I don't think whatever Tywin did was strictly by the books (among other things, Tyrion and Tysha had had consummated their marriage, so they wouldn't have been eligible for annulment anyway), but I'm doubtful that this is going to be a major plot point.
4370	Woman of War	2014-05-22	We could see that "and if I never want" as a very Martinesque red herring to hide the story turn that exactly the contrary will happen in the end. Just like Martin  sending Sansa to bed with Baelish would be the big red herring leading away from her killing LF in a spectacular manner later in the books. And the series will only speed up events but not basically alter them. So hints should be taken seriously, if only as clear indication that every road is still open.
And the show definitely works at keeping every option open with th the altered dynamics between Tyrion and Sansa. And we do not yet know about the impact of Tysha and Tyrion's quest for her in the series.
I am a firm believer that the show will.not alter the final outcome of plots but, as it is the nature of that medium, will condense plotlines while heading there and emphazise those aspects who will be of future importance. There is that ring, Sansa will either throw it away in a dramatic manner or she will explicitely keep her mind occupied with it. There is the kiss between her and Baelish with inappropriately little disgust - misinterpretation or simply going ahead in the story?

4371	Alayne Stone	2014-05-22	I just re-watched the episode and something caught my attention.
Â 
LF says, "to build a new home, you need to tear the old one down" (paraphrasing)
Â 
I think it's curious that he said it right before Sansa asked him why he killed Joffrey. And I think that's exactly why LF arranged the Purple Wedding: not to avenge Cat, but because he's tearing down his previous "home", the Lannister regime, to build his own kingdom, base, whatever you want to call it, starting with the North (Sansa), the Vale (Harry the Heir) and the Riverlands (LF himself)


Â 
I like this read, as well as how it fed into Sansa's motivation for asking the next question, which didn't make sense to me until now.. Â Also: to build a new Sansa, you had to do the same thing.
4372	Alayne Stone	2014-05-22	I have not read the previous thread, but i have always wondered if and where to find discussions on one of my favourite theories:
Is Sansa the only Stark child to face a different destiny?
All the children of Ned still have a redeemable relationship with their direwolf, but Sansa (unless Lady comes backfrom the dead, that is).
I think this is the perfect premise for a major difference between her and the others. Will she be the one to rule in the North? Will shebe the one to betray the others and their family? I guess something THIS major.
Any feedback?

Â 
Wondered this a lot. Â I think her plot has gone on too long for her to ultimately end like that. It'd be deflating to see her grow and change so much only to catastrophically fail. Unless she can't grow out of her childishness, of course, but that would also be deflating. Â I've preferred to interpret it that if Lady had lived - ie, had Sansa not sided (albeit neutrally) with Joffrey, as she would when betraying Ned - then she might have been spared the suffering of Kings Landing.

The only two ways Sansa could have avoided all the suffering at KL are:
-Ned sends them North ASAP
-Ned succeeds.
If Lady was alive in the aftermath of Robert's death, she would have been killed in the battle or Joffrey would have kept her alive so he could hurt her and, that way, hurt Sansa. And good luck trying to escape and assume a fake identity with an injured direwolf in tow.
Â 
OTOH, a secretly skinchanger prisoner Sansa would give her more options. Joffrey's horse only needs to rear up while Joffrey is mounting it for the king to die or get permanently crippled.

I think some nuance didn't come across. Â For Lady to die, Ned had to choose Robert over his daughter and Sansa had to choose Joffrey over her father. Â The King's Landing debacle happened because, ultimately, Ned chose Robert over his family and Sansa chose Joffrey over her father.

Oh, I see. Definitely. Starks tend to have an issue in putting their family's interests above all else.
4377	Newstar	2014-05-22	Something that fans tend to forget in these discussions about Ned and Lady is GRRM himself has pointedly refused to absolve Sansa of bearing responsibility for Ned and Lady's deaths. I tend to think there's a reason for that. I distinctly remember this post from Trebla on the boards recounting previous conversations with GRRM, both way back in 2001 and in 2007:
Â 
Â 
We've had these debates before about whether Sansa's actions truly resulted in her losing her wolf and father. And whether losing Lady symbolized her ceasing to be a true Stark. In fact, we've had this debate in front of GRRM twice.The first time was in St Louis in 2001 while at dinner. GRRM let us debate, smiling and nodding here and there. He also told us why he created Sansa in the first place, because there is always someone in a family that the others don't get along with. He was a bit coy in answering our questions but in the end he did indicate that Sansa did have responsibility for Lady's and Ned's deaths. I reported this to the board and I recall it being dismissed by some. I distinctly recall someone saying, "Well what I think he really meant to say was..."
The second time we had this discussion was in Indy in 2007. There was a boarder there that didn't believe that Sansa's losing Lady symbolized her not being a Stark anymore. The person said so in front of GRRM and GRRM smiled and said, "Doesn't it?"
Â 
The bit from that quote about how Sansa was created as an afterthought as a focal point for family conflict--because the Starks were too warm and cozy as it was--coupled with the knowledge that GRRM has had his endgames in mind for his characters since the beginning, kind of has me wonder in the past how important she could possibly be in the grand scheme of things. Something to bear in mind before letting one's imagination run away with epic endgames for Sansa. GRRM being coy about the possibility that Sansa's loss of Lady means that she's no longer a Stark--even when asked straight out by a fan--has also made me wonder about how realistic an endgame Sansa as queen in the North/rebuilder of Winterfell/regent for Rickon/etc. etc. truly is. If Sansa truly has been permanently "unstarked" due to the loss of her wolf--and GRRM's fond of "no takebacksies" in such matters--then she's not winding up anywhere near a permanent position at Winterfell.
Â 
As far as I can tell, if Sansa is truly "unstarked," that might not necessarily rule out a future as queen consort to whoever winds up on the Iron Throne (assuming it's a dude)--making her a Targ or a Baratheon, depending on which poor SOB is stuck with the damned thing--or as lady of the Vale or similar. I mean, she'd still technically be Sansa Stark, so I'm not really sure how well it fits. What seems more logical, however, is a scenario where Sansa chooses or is forced to remain Alayne Stone permanently, even if the hair dye and Sansa's current situation would seem to make that a tricky proposition. To really align the permanent loss of her Stark identity to her "Stone" identity symbolically with Sansa's loss of Lady, though, assuming that's where GRRM's headed with this, Sansa being unable to return to her Stark identity permanently would have to be involuntary, just as her loss of Lady was against her wishes.

He has also stated that in the story to date she "comes to accept responsibility for her part" in Ned's death, which...I'm not really clear where he thinks that happened.
4379	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-22	Martin:Â I don't have any but I was one once. When the series was originally conceived, it was only three volumes long and I did not know that several of the main characters were going to be stuck with being children for so much of it. The hardest chapters for me to write are the ones about Bran, just because he is the character most involved in magic, the youngest child and he is so seriously crippled--I have to write in that sense of powerlessness and it has always to convince. Sansa was the least sympathetic of the Starks in the first book; she has become more sympathetic, partly because she comes to accept responsibility for her part in her father's death. Jon Snow is the truest character--I like his sense of realism and the way he copes with his bastardy.
Â 
Â 
Yeah, never understood that part either. And this is after ASoS was published.

Â 
Yeah, that never happened. She blames Joffrey and Cersei for repaying her love and trust with her father's head. If GRRM intended to convey guilt on Sansa's part or acceptance of responsibility, he failed miserably. If he had conveyed it more successfully, we might have been able to head off these discussions about the extent of Sansa's responsibility and all the claims that Sansa's total lack of guilt over her role in Ned's death is proof positive that she will go darkside off at the pass. It would have been pretty easy to write: Sansa puts the pieces together about how her information must have assisted Cersei so that the reader grasps her part in it (much as GRRM explained it in that SSM), she rightly blames Joffrey and Cersei for betraying her but is nonetheless wracked with guilt, she has nightmares about Ned accusing her beyond the grave (cheesy, I know, but gets the point across), she makes her peace with her guilt and tries to atone by doing X, Y, and Z, blah blah blah. Easy peasy. GRRM could write this stuff in his sleep (and has, for other characters' redemption arcs, who admittedly have done far more that requires redemption); that he seems to think he did write Sansa accepting responsibility for her part in her father's death when he clearly did not is puzzling.

4381	Colonel Green	2014-05-22	On the question of Sansa's creation/how important she is, I don't think she could be considered as "afterthought"; she's a refinement of the story, and when you look at how the plot has developed, she's been woven in quite thoroughly by this point.Â  Littlefinger, in particular, may have existed in whatever outline of the series Martin had developed prior to creating Sansa, but in final form he is primarily a character in Sansa's story.Â  Not just in the POV sense, but his motives, (apparent) weakness, etc. are all tied into her.Â  And Littlefinger is a pretty big piece of the story.Â  Incidentally, I don't think she's going to be queen or anything, incidentally (partly because of her association with Littlefinger, who, unlike in the show's telling, I really don't think is a guy who wants the throne; he and Varys, even Olenna, are all about working behind other people).
4382	phantomg	2014-05-22	About Sansa's 4x08 preview scene. What if that is WoW material already? I read here somewhere that there's a Sansa chapter supposed to be in A Dance with Dragons but was postponed to WoW due to some big event that happens.
After reading that, I thought that maybe Sansa would try to kill Littlefinger because she can't tolerate being a puppetÂ anymore, being asked to kill Rob maybe triggered it... But revealing the truth to the Vale Lords is a valid path too, because she gains their trust, Petyr dies by treason and she is finally in the game.
What do you guys think?

Well, it's not hard. Cersei falls from power, the Tyrells still want to execute Sansa to cover their asses, Aegon doesn't want to leave a precedent of someone killing a king and walking scot-free, Stannis dies and, as far as Dany is concerned, Sansa is just one of the Usurper's bitches. So it's never safe for Sansa to announce who she really is and decides to remain Alayne Stone/maybe Baelish for the rest of her days. Just maybe, she decides to reveal her identity, in secret, to one of her surviving siblings, if she ever reunites with them.

GRRM didn't use the word afterthought, but when a character has solely been created to prevent an established family of characters from being too adorably close, then regardless of what the author does with that character subsequently, the character will still have been "created as an afterthought," as I said. If GRRM had been comfortable with a Norman Rockwell-worthy vision of Stark family harmony, Sansa would never have been "born." In of itself, no great shakes, perhaps, but knowing that GRRM has had his endgames in mind for the characters since the beginning, it does seem to rule out some of the more impressive endgames for her often batted around by fans.
Â 
When I think of GRRM creating Sansa just to stir the Stark family pot, I'm reminded of this. Not that Sansa's a jerk, but still, heh: "And just to make it interesting," indeed.
Â 
I don't think she's going to be queen or anything
Â 
Me, neither. That particular ship sailed in AGOT, in my opinion.
Â 
Of course, if I'm right that Sansa has been permanently "unstarked," then that rules out a lot of her potential endgames: lady of the Vale is still viable if she somehow marries Harry as Alayne--although lady of anything (Highgarden, Riverrun, etc.) seems way too high-profile for someone if Sansa intends to remain in hiding--but anything involving Winterfell is out, queenship is obviously out, etc. etc. Not quite sure what would be left for her as Alayne if she cannot return to her Sansa identity, except maybe running off with the Hound to live in peaceful obscurity. That would be suitably bittersweet: Sansa gets true love and a happy romantic ending, which is what she's wanted since day one in the books and which she values so highly, but is forced to sacrifice pretty much everything else in the process. It also ties in neatly to Robert telling Ned to get Sansa a dog instead of a wolf: she loses her "wolf" (her Starkness) but gets a "dog" as replacement (the Hound as lover/husband, what have you) and is "happier for it" (she gets a happy ending with the Hound even though she has lost her Stark identity forever).

4386	juanml82	2014-05-22	About Sansa's 4x08 preview scene. What if that is WoW material already? I read here somewhere that there's a Sansa chapter supposed to be in A Dance with Dragons but was postponed to WoW due to some big event that happens.
After reading that, I thought that maybe Sansa would try to kill Littlefinger because she can't tolerate being a puppetÂ anymore, being asked to kill Rob maybe triggered it... But revealing the truth to the Vale Lords is a valid path too, because she gains their trust, Petyr dies by treason and she is finally in the game.
What do you guys think?


I don't think so. I think the whole deal about "Lord Baelish has told many lies" is a performance prearranged between the two of them to make their lie more convincing. I don't think they'll jump into TWOW material so soon. It's probably a mix of the meeting with Nestor Royce, the meeting with the Lords Declarant and some invention (or maybe based in actual TWOW material just like Arya's inn scene in the show has parts of TWOW material) so Sansa does something for a change.
4387	Khal Porno	2014-05-22	Yeah I don't get it either but you have to admit that he nailed the short sharp push, the push was perfect.Â 


Yeah, and "your sister" was just as cruel as "only Cat," and meant the exact same thing and served the exact same dramatic function.Â  The only change here was the number of syllables.
4388	Colonel Green	2014-05-22	the Tyrells still want to execute Sansa to cover their asses


With regard to what?Â  In any event, the setup at the end of AFFC is fairly suggestive that, one way or another, "Alayne Stone" isn't going to be a disguise much longer.
Â 
Also, your scenario would basically involve Sansa not interacting with anybody else in the "main cast" for the remainder of the story, which seems unlikely.

With regards to the assassination of Joffrey. Essentially, when Cersei was imprisoned, Sansa was still a wanted fugitive. If Cersei were to fall but the Tyrells still held the Throne, there is no reason to believe they'd issue a pardon to Sansa Stark, whom they've framed for murder in the first place.
The people who Sansa couldn't meet are only those who've met her at King's Landing. True, that's a large number of people, but it's by no means a huge amount nor are going to necessarily going to meet her in the future:
I'm probably going to forget characters but let's see: Tommen, Myrcella, Cersei, (Jaime might cover up for her), the surviving Kingsguards, the entire Tyrell family, the Redwyne twins, assorted knights would might not survive the coming wars, Bronn (might be turned to her side, depending on how Sansa's story develops), Chella, Pod (might cover up for her), Varys, Lancel, Xalabar Xho (ok, that's a joke), Margery cousins and friends, and I think there isn't too many people. The audiences after the Blackwater involved a lot of people, but Sansa wasn't very exposed, and everyone else was too busy getting rewards or trying to contact the important people.
Â 
She could still physically interact with everyone at the Vale, the Riverlands, even some characters from the Reach like Randyll Tarly, Aegon and Dany entourage (except for Tyrion and Barristan, and Tyrion might be convinced to cover up for her) and all the characters in the Riverlands except for Harwin. The Northern Lords should recognize her, but how many of them are going to deliver her to KL to be executed for killing Joffrey?

Sansa will have to come up with a story for the dying. Such as "I don't like my hair color"*. Sure, people will still get suspicious. Those who may be swayed to support her can keep their mouth shut out of personal interest. Those who don't might not come up with anything else than suspicions. It's not easy, and her story might not be headed that way, but it's possible.
Â 
*ETA: "I was afraid my father wouldn't believe me when I wrote him. He's the only family I have, I wanted to look more like him" (Tears, tears, keeps playing the poor orphan girl). Or anything else. And she'll need to come with a story whether she remains Alayne for long or not, unless LF brought hair dye from Gulltown.

Er, yeah, but that's a short-term issue, not something at all likely to be relevant in the series' postscript, after multiple Targaryen invasions and the Others probably ripping large swathes of Westeros to pieces.

I am convinced that after a short time sharing bed, dinner table, laundry, conversation and books with Sandor (fuck, that chair's leg is too short, get me that damn book you are reading!) the two might turn out to be thoroughly incompatible. Unfortunately love does not overcome everything, that is only for six months or so. And then the sense of smell sets in again.  But nevermind those fans who like it would be happy, everything else would happen offscreen after the books are done and we readers would not know about it, as it is the nature of fairy tales.
If I may dare a prediction - just as unfounded as any other shipping - Sansa might end with the proverbial blacksmith Jaime predicted for her, meaning Gendry, who is nice and considerate.

And she'll need to come with a story whether she remains Alayne for long or not, unless LF brought hair dye from Gulltown.Concerning Sansa's hair:
What if at some time of the story she will be forced as well, as a parallel to her sister's story, to flee in disguise as peasant or as young man? Granted, she may have serious trouble to hide her female body and would look like a boy of  seventeen in book version or, tall as she is,  like a young man of twenty in HBO version. And her manners may unveil her as somewhat highborn, a highborn young man should always have some training with arms and she hasn't. But she could at least try as a peasant woman, bald head to fight the lice and with dirt in her face.
Both disguises would give her a reason to shave her head for safety and to hide her hair colour, like Egg did. And after some time, at some very different part of the universe, the little problem of having run out of dye will be forgotten, the hair can safely grow back.
Edit:
@Colonel Green:
I guess you could  be right and Sansa and Tyrion share the same problem and the same solution here: At some point of the story the formal accusation of kingslaying and in Tyrion's case, kinslaying may be a relatively minor problem for both (on the surface, not as inner turmoil for Tyrion and Sansa may have her own ghosts to fight) compared to the huge events the two may have a part in.

Â 
I am not so sure that Alayne is just the another mask Sansa put on her. There is no doubt that her identity as Stark, her wolf blood are still in her, strong as ever, but Alayne has to serve to some purpose. My theory is that it will lead Sansa to Harrenhal. But, ultimately, there is no doubt she will reclaim her identity at some point.Â 
Â 
I got idea last night about what "lies" TV Sansa might be referring in next episode. Perhaps she will say that she is not LF's niece but bastard? That way the transition to Alayne Stone would be complete. We might go that direction since LF told that she might have been his daughter.

4396	~No One~	2014-05-23	^If this is so, it would need to serve the purpose of getting LF free of blame for Lysa's death. I do believe the ship has sailed on Alayne as LF's bastard, unfortunately. Which is too bad. Let's hope I'm wrong!
I saw a theory posted by another, which I liked, where LF tries to say Lysa tripped, but then Sansa says Lysa was drunk, and basically that LF was lying to cover that up. I think this is plausible, in terms of the show and a lack of a Marillion character. Why they couldn't bring back Mord with a mouthful of golden teeth is beyond me.

Â 
That makes sense. LF tells a more flattering version of the "truth," in a way that suggests that he loved Lysa and is trying to protect her reputation, while Sansa claims that that's a lie and tells the "truth," which is probably less flattering to Lysa (she was drunk or something similar). The "truth" that she's a bastard and not LF's niece as he claimed could be thrown in there as well, since TV Sansa says that LF has told "many lies." That Alayne is his niece--since whether or not he had any siblings would be pretty easy to verify, a bastard daughter less so--could be one of them.
Â 
I kind of like the idea of there being no patsy, or rather Lysa being the patsy, and Sansa and LF coming up with an elaborate show on their own to convince the lords. It lacks the bite of what happened with Marillion, since there is no frameup of someone innocent of the crime involved (well, framing Lysa I suppose for her own death, I guess), but it could still work, showing LF roping Sansa into working with him.
Â 
I'm curious as to how the show will do it. Maybe Sansa will angrily confront LF--there was that shot of her stalking through a corridor looking pissed--and LF will try to rope Sansa into selling a false story to the lords investigating. Sansa storms off, unconvinced, and the next scene we have is the scene with LF giving his version of events. There's a moment of suspense when Sansa mentions LF's lies, and then she comes out with the "truth" absolving LF. Afterwards, we find out either 1) it was an elaborate show LF and Sansa cooked up sometime after Sansa stormed off previously (meaning she eventually came around) or 2) Sansa made it all up on the spot and LF truly didn't know which way she'd go. #1 seems more likely, since I doubt LF would leave something like that to chance if he really thought there was a possibility that Sansa would rat him out, but who knows? TV Littlefinger is dumber than his book self, after all.

Â 
Yeah, I could see her being a "Stone" coming up in that scene as well. I actually rather like this version of the lie and the "truth" that Sansa tells. As for whether it's part of the plan or not, I think either way works well for her character, though making it up on the spot would be a nice way for her to make LF nervous without actually betraying him. Especially if after saying "he's told many lies, I must tell the truth" she then starts off with "I'm not really his niece..."
Â 
I don't know why, but I'm reminded of the scene in ACOK when she tells Joffrey that she'd like to see him face Robb in single combat.
4399	Newstar	2014-05-23	It could be really cool if done right, Chebyshov. I'm liking it more and more as I think about it. Marillion who? Bonus points if Sansa legit makes it up on the spot because she wants to see LF squirm.

Ah, but you're countering speculation with more speculation. Who's to say that Sansa will live to the series postscript? I guess your second line refers to the Northern Lords recognizing her, and there is no guarantee that Sansa will ever return to the North either.
Â 
If Sansa survives the series (remember, we don't know if she will), we have no idea what will happen to the Iron Throne. If there is a king or queen there who isn't an ally of her, that person might not want to let a kingslayer get away with it, even if the dead king is a different king.
Â 
And, of course, this is all speculation.
4401	Alayne Stone	2014-05-23	TV Littlefinger is dumber than his book self, after all.


Â 
I've been depressed about this for four years. Â I think Petyr will have a plan and that Sansa won't do it and will go off the script. It will turn out to be more brilliant because we need an elaborate set-up to show how great Sansa is, despite that it's required some spectacular stupidity on the part of her mentor to make it happen. Â Sadly, it's not as impressive when you show that you're smarter than a dumb person.
4402	Newstar	2014-05-23	Yeah, although to be fair, Book LF has relied a lot on luck as well, as opposed to controlling all potential outcomes so that luck is irrelevant. Xanatos he is not.

4403	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-23	Damn!! This topic got good as hell since I last posted. I'm frothing at the mouth with intrigue. So much to discuss/speculate! 
Â 


I find certain pairings loathsome, but if I see something that hints at it, or if someone's argument against those pairings is weak, I'll gladly point it out, and most here will do the same. I spent a lot of words arguing unthread that it's possible that Sansa and LF might have a consensual love affair, and I can assure you that that's my nightmare scenario; I just don't see any slam dunk basis for ruling it out at this stage.


Â 
And here, I was on the verge of confessing my utter devotion and admiration for all posts "Newstar", until you started going on about how its conceivable that Petyr and Sansa could enter into a consensual sexual relationship with each other. Granted, I think its ENTIRELY possible, and since I'm not one to rule out ANY theory, I agreed with your basic argument. But in my mind I thought...oy! How can you argue FOR that relationship? The man is either directly responsible for--or had a hand in--every horrible thing that has befallen Sansa. What kind of foundation is THAT to build a relationship on? So, yeah, its nice to see that you actually DON'T support that scenario. 
Â 
As a side...if any of you actually do 'ship' Petyr and Sansa, more power to you. A part of me understands the appeal. For me personally though, I think he has caused her and her family too much harm for that relationship to end in "happily ever after". If it does, it either means she has 'forgiven' his involvement in all of these things (namely, her father's death), or that she never finds out; both of which make her appear either disloyal or unintelligent. Needless to say, as a Sansa fan, the prospect of her ending the series with either--or both--of those descriptions attached to her name makes me want to jump off a cliff. 
Â 
Â 


We could see that "and if I never want" as a very Martinesque red herring to hide the story turn that exactly the contrary will happen in the end. Just like Martin sending Sansa to bed with Baelish would be the big red herring leading away from her killing LF in a spectacular manner later in the books. And the series will only speed up events but not basically alter them. So hints should be taken seriously, if only as clear indication that every road is still open.


Â 
This. All of this.

Â 


Â 
You know, I've been thinking about this very point a lot lately. See, this entire time, I've wholeheartedly committed myself to this ideal scenario that she stays at the Vale, plays the 'Game' and eventually acquires (as Kingdoms) The Vale, the North and the River Lands. Hell, I would even venture to say that at least 90% of Sansa fans think this. But with the show not dying her hair, the lack of emphasis on the 'Alyane' persona, Robin knowing who she is, hell...even the ring...I'm beginning to wondering if she's even going to be at the Vale for much longer. I mean, hell, what if Brienne indeeds finds her within the first two episodes of season 5 and takes her somewhere? That would certainly be mind-blowing (as NO ONE expects it), but I think it would also signal the fact that truly....her story is very different than any of us have imagine. Â

Here's what I've always wondered; why couldn't she use the fact that she knows THEY murdered Joffrey against THEM? Hell, while we're at it, why couldn't she use all of Petyr's murders against HIM? I feel like she has much more leverage than we give her credit for. Can someone explain to me why that's not the case?Â

As for the pairing itself, blargh, do not want. Unfortunately, "blargh, do not want" isn't much of an argument.
Big news is up on WIC.net for Season 5 casting, albeit a non-exhaustive list. It's mostly Dorne, KL (Lollys, High Sparrow, Unella), and Essos characters (Yezzan and the Waif), and mostly minor ones. No Sansa plot line characters YET, but I wouldn't worry about that: non-exhaustive list and all that. No Brienne, North, Sam, or IB plot line castings, either.
Between Yezzan and Septa Unella, it looks like Season 5 will cover most of Tyrion and Cersei's published book plot.

Good question. In the books is clear that she trusts none else and she can really make use of the information (yet). In the show, I think LF got her measure a lot better than in the books and he's tempting her with everything a young Westerosi orphan girl can desire.
Â 
Which is to say, murder.

And I bet she will!
HBO Sansa may realize what I have always hoped for: she may have the cleverness and determination to play Sherlock and investigate a little, she may file through letters, listen behind doors, innocently question the right people... something like that. Book Sansa is still ages away from that cunning but HBO Sansa might sparkle here, doing what will take far longer for little book Sansa.
And if she indeed finds some equivalent to proof she has not only power over LF, she may really influence the plot further south since she has power over Tyrion as well in a positive sense: she can get him acquitted from having murdered Joffrey. And she equally has the power to save the relationship of Jaime and Tyrion.

I really don't understand why you think TV!Sansa is smarter than Book!Sansa, when she's accomplished far less than the latter.
Â 

And if she indeed finds some equivalent to proof she has not only power over LF, she may really influence the plot further south since she has power over Tyrion as well in a positive sense: she can get him acquitted from having murdered Joffrey. And she equally has the power to save the relationship of Jaime and Tyrion.

Tyrion has already been convicted of murdering Joffrey in a way that doesn't allow for an appeal.Â  And Jaime and Tyrion's relationship breakdown really has nothing to do with whether he murdered Joffrey, and everything to do with Tysha.

4412	MarieAntoinette	2014-05-23	As a side...if any of you actually do 'ship' Petyr and Sansa, more power to you. A part of me understands the appeal. For me personally though, I think he has caused her and her family too much harm for that relationship to end in "happily ever after". If it does, it either means she has 'forgiven' his involvement in all of these things (namely, her father's death), or that she never finds out; both of which make her appear either disloyal or unintelligent. Needless to say, as a Sansa fan, the prospect of her ending the series with either--or both--of those descriptions attached to her name makes me want to jump off a cliff. 
Â

Part of me wishes that Sansa becomes LF apprentice, they have an affair, she gains his trust only to outwit him and cause his downfall in the end. I'm not really a big Sansa fan , but I'm interested in her story and want her to become a real player of the game.Â

Â 
Please tell, why exactly does she need to have an affair with him in that scenario? She would be unable to gain his trust or to outwit with unless she lets him fuck her? How is the former necessary for the latter?
Â 
It sometimes seems like a lot of people have this bizarre fascination with the idea of Sansa prostituting herself to a guy before she screws him over,Â  as opposed to manipulating him by acting like she is still a naive little girl (which she is doing now) and causing his downfall without letting him fuck her, which is something she doesn't want and wouldn't be getting anything from. It's like everyone is so in love with the idea that she has to become some sort of a Mata Hari figure for whom sex is just a means to an end for her to show that she's become 'awesome'.
4414	~No One~	2014-05-23	^I actually thought her arc was all about going from 'I want to be queen and have lots of babies' to 'I don't want or need a husband, and will learn to save myself'.
Also, she learns to appreciate Winterfell, and mistrust knights. She's ending up as the opposite to everything she once stood for...husbands included.

I guess because Baelish's fall will be far more spectacular if before it he had been very sure of having Sansa on his side, as partner in every sense. It is obvious that Sansa's story would be more dramatic, that she would present more resolution if her hatred after finding out about Baelish is not only based on a lukewarm association but on an "affair". She would have invested more and of course her revenge would be served even sweeter.
So the simple reason for seeing the story advantages of Sansa being more involved with LF is not some prurient fascination by those who are sex depraved but simply the promise of a more intense plot - and actually the most intense or interesting plots are rarely those that are easy to digest but  those that hurt at some point.
No one here is talking rape and I guess we all could do without the physical details of said "affair".
Edit: do you seriously think I "wanted" Tyrion to kill Shae? And yet, painful as it was to read this event certainly was a great enhancement to his arc.

Â 
I definitely agree with this sentiment.Â  Among other things, it represents a complete failure for Sansa to hold true to her ideals and her honor.Â  She took a lot of pride in being a proper lady, which included training and morality lessons by a Septa.Â  Unfortunately, she so bought into these ideals she failed to realize what a horrible people the queen and the crown prince were.Â 
Â 
Yet, to go completely off the wall and to sleep with a man posing as her father?Â  Who betrayed her actual father?Â  Who framed her for regicide?Â 
Â 
That is all kinds of disturbed.Â  One of these days I will finish my write up of "Sansa's two fathers" which compares and contrasts Baelish and Eddard, because these two guys are teaching different things.Â  Ultimately, if Sansa has to chose Littlefinger's lessons over Eddards... I fell like it would be a bigger tragedy than his beheading was.
4418	Newstar	2014-05-23	I don't really get the shock at the idea that Sansa might prostitute herself to manipulate Petyr or get ahead in the game of thrones, especially since absent dragons, sex--fucking useful or powerful people, or marrying useful or powerful people whom they will then fuck--is the main way for women who are unable to inherit to achieve power or attain their political goals (even Dany is cornered into attempting to fuck her way to peace). Even a right of inheritance is no guarantee of anything. Cersei advised her about the weapon between her legs in ACOK, and while the rest of that advice was shit, Cersei had a point: Alys "jokes" that she could have avoided her fate had she successfully charmed Robb as a child. She's sort of kidding, but not really. This is true of men as well. Petyr prostituted himself by bedding Lysa to get ahead, Bronn cheerfully sold himself off in a loveless marriage to achieve the same end. Hyle Hunt would have happily prostituted himself to Brienne, had she permitted it. Many of the female players use sex or try to use sex as a tool to achieve political goals. It seems odd to hype Sansa as this budding political player while insisting that she will never ever ever EVER use sex as a means to an end, when in Westeros that's pretty much how it's done, unless you can pimp someone else out for your own goals (Viserys, Olenna, LF, etc.).

Now everybody is assuming that Sansa my prostitute herself. And what if she develops emotions for Baelish? I mean he presents a caring and kind faA§ade, has manners, eduaction and brains. Is it sooo unthinkable that she falls for him? She does not have the background informations we have. Empowering herself by information should be her arc. So far she is only suspicious and with good reason. What if Baelish manages to convince her of his honest intentions towards her? And then, slowly and cleverly she discovers the truth about what he did to her family.  Her revenge would be the more devastating because at some point she believed in him. 
No, actually I do not see Sansa starting out to consciously use her sexuality, that might come when she is seriously in need of a weapon.
4422	Colonel Green	2014-05-23	Is it sooo unthinkable that she falls for him?


Um, yeah, kind of.Â  The more Stockholm'd aspect of Sansa's mindset has a fondness for "Petyr", the more paternal and friendly aspect of his behaviour toward her, but it is always clearly circumscribed within those bounds.Â  The part of him that manifests sexual interest in her is "Littlefinger", which she excusively distrusts.
4423	Woman of War	2014-05-23	You believe Sansa thinks the way you think because you forget that she does not know what you or we as readers know. Only she doesn't.  Peter is actually the only person she believes to have in the world and he seems to really care for her

Sansa knows that LF brokered the Lannister-Tyrell alliance and had Ned's foster parent murdered. That's about it. She heard about Lysa's letter, but she doesn't know its impact.
Contrast this to the Hound who
Killed her sister's friend just because
Killed members of her household she knew for her entire life, possibly even including her best friend's father (she knows it was the Hound who broke into Jeyne's chambers) and may have been instrumental in the Ned's defeat in the Throne Room
Threatened to kill her - and Sansa believed it.
Watched over while she was beaten and did nothing
Only offered to take her away when he was abandoning the Lannisters - just like Baelish.
Â 
If she can lust for the Hound after all this, I don't see how her limited knowledge of LF's actions can be an impediment. Littlefinger's small build is probably more of a hindrance than his deeds.

Â 
Wasn't the Mercy chapter originally written with a time jump in mind? I'm thinking the nature of that scene should have been rethought.
Â 
But it is important to note that the female influences in Sansa's life since being in KL (Cersei and Margery) very much use their sexuality to suit their own ends. In fact, in the show, this is heavily explicated: Cersei tells Sansa the best weapon is in between her legs, and Margery advises here to make the best of her situation and sleep with Tyrion because life is to short to limit the kinds of sex we should have.
Â 
So IMO, Sansa could go this route, Â or could very pointedly not.
4429	Colonel Green	2014-05-23	"Peter and I have more important concerns"

"Father and I have larger concerns."Â  That reinforces my whole point about how she views "Petyr" versus "Littlefinger"; his sexual advances are all assigned to the latter persona, the one she doesn't like.

What would make Sansa different from so many other female characters in that world? Sansa's character does not exist in a vacuum. Why should Martin forget in her case that sexuality has many faces and one very prominent face at that timesetting is sexuality being a weapon of attack and self defense for women.
4432	Newstar	2014-05-23	Sansa's already started to trade kisses she doesn't otherwise want to give in exchange for getting Sweetrobin to do what she says. It doesn't mean she'll be fucking Sweetrobin anytime soon, but Arya wasn't luring dudes to secluded streets with the promise of sex and feeding their bodies to eels back in AGOT, either. Everything starts somewhere, and Sansa has already started to trade in kisses to get what she wants. Might not mean anything, but it's yet another reason why Sansa using sex as a means to an end would not be shocking.
The sexual content in Arya's TWOW chapter was sufficiently shocking to me that I'm now really worried about what Sansa's chapters in TWOW will entail.

Ok, I imagine that there is some equal sign between feminism and enjoying rape that I fail to see, but simply, the only way LF can have sex with Sansa is to rape her. Plain and simple. She has no romantic nor sexual feelings for him. His advances on her were greeted with refusal every single time. She doesn't see him as sexual being, and further more, she doesn't feel comfortable around him. Her emotions and desires are rather clear. So, the only thing she might enjoy is rape or attempt of rape. How very progressive, empowering and feminist of her would that be. Yeah...Â  Â  Â  
Â 
Then we have this Sansa using sex as weapon. People, have you actually read her chapters? Like, really read? We are speaking about girl whose every encounter with sexuality has been more than tragic. And suddenly, she will transform into seductress a la Cersei, using her body as leverage. And then, people speak about this being empowerment and feminismÂ  Â  Â  Â ... Wow, I am beyond speechless.

Â 
It's a feminist wish fulfillment arc for a young girl to actually NOT be raped by the murderer holding her powerless?
4440	joachim	2014-05-23	And the show has used jewelry, not so much in a portending the character's future sort of way, but to tell us things about the characters the way their clothes do: the Lannisters love big, flashy rings because it's a show of wealth and power, Dany wears a little collar type necklace to show solidarity with the slaves (from some or other featurette), and so on. That's why Sansa's ring was so great: it was so obviously a Lannister ring, and whether a wedding ring or not, clearly marked her as their property..which makes the fact that she's still wearing it all the more mystifying.


It could've just as easily been a gift from Tyrion, and she wears it because she likes nice things.
4441	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-23	I think she has to learn how to use this info. Whom to tell, when, why, etc. I agree she's got a lot of credit in the Iron Bank of Blackmail at the moment.
Also, sorry for double-posting


Â 
"Iron Bank of Blackmail". 
Â 


Well, that also applies to the Hound, to a large degree. Granted, I don't see them in a lasting relationship, but some people do.
Â 
Good question. In the books is clear that she trusts none else and she can really make use of the information (yet). In the show, I think LF got her measure a lot better than in the books and he's tempting her with everything a young Westerosi orphan girl can desire.
Â 
Which is to say, murder.


Â 
Which is a more believable 'carrot' if you ask me (the possibility of revenge/murder). It always confused me why (Book)Sansa didn't harbor an outright bloodthirst for revenge. I kind of figured that that sort of desire simply wasn't in her 'character'...but then, that's not realistic (at least not to me). I think the show, however, is going the revenge route and it pleases me.
Â 


And I bet she will!
HBO Sansa may realize what I have always hoped for: she may have the cleverness and determination to play Sherlock and investigate a little, she may file through letters, listen behind doors, innocently question the right people... something like that. Book Sansa is still ages away from that cunning but HBO Sansa might sparkle here, doing what will take far longer for little book Sansa.
And if she indeed finds some equivalent to proof she has not only power over LF, she may really influence the plot further south since she has power over Tyrion as well in a positive sense: she can get him acquitted from having murdered Joffrey. And she equally has the power to save the relationship of Jaime and Tyrion.


Â 
And in the show...she knows even less than she did in the book. I mean, at least in the book she heard about Lysa and Petyr poisoning Jon Arryn and sending the fake letter to Cat and Ned. She doesn't even have THAT in the show. So, either the kid's about to turn into a regular Sherlock Holmes, or none of that information ultimately matters to her storyline.
Â 


Â 
Part of me wishes that Sansa becomes LF apprentice, they have an affair, she gains his trust only to outwit him and cause his downfall in the end. I'm not really a big Sansa fan , but I'm interested in her story and want her to become a real player of the game.Â

Â 
GRRM's written "POV female character enjoying rape" before, a character who was once very much like Sansa, in fact, so blame him for writing it. GRRM does not care one whit about his readers' potentially delicate sensibilities; if he did, he wouldn't have "treated" us to this Littlefinger/Sansa grossness to begin with. And yet Littlefinger/Sansa grossness is part of her arc and has been since way back in AGOT, when Littlefinger undressed an 11-year-old Sansa with his eyes and stroked her hair, and now GRRM has contrived it so that a pedophile intent on grooming Sansa is the most significant figure currently in her life, so here we are.
Â 
This series is often full of nasty, stomach-churning, offputting material and GRRM goes out of his way to shock and offend. Moreover, as ASOIAF readers grow increasingly jaded and are gradually desensitized to ASOIAF gore and rape, GRRM seems to keep trying to come up with new and exciting ways to top himself in the horror department, with each book being progressively more disturbing and disgusting: in ADWD, we were "treated" to a dying Quentyn's eyeballs liquefying, Tyrion raping a dead-eyed slave, Jeyne tortured and alluding to bestiality, and other such "delights." AGOT seems positively tame in comparison. GRRM seems to be stepping this up in TWOW as well, and the Starks are by no means exempt, as Arya has "graduated" from being merely propositioned by pedophiles to being molested by them and to weaponizing her sexuality, despite being all of 11 years old. As I said: GRRM doesn't care if his readers are disturbed. The books are calculated to disturb. Whatever else we may say about GRRM, he gives good horror.
Â 
I think this tendency of GRRM's to go for the gritty and extreme--heightened in later books (that AFFC sequence where some Ironborn is raping Humfrey Hewett's daughter in front of him after the daughter, whose age is not specified, was forced to serve Ironborn thugs naked was way more disturbing than anything in the first three books)--is something we should all bear in mind when speculating about Sansa. If GRRM is more likely to go for something calculated to make his readers recoil, given the choice, and if the books are getting progressively nastier in terms of content--more gore, more creatively horrifying injuries, more abuse, more rape, more mutilation, more disfigurement, more cannibalism, more physical or sexual torture, more psychological torture (the walk of shame, Reek), etc. etc.--which the Mercy TWOW chapter would certainly seem to support, then I very much doubt that Sansa will be exempt from that.
Â 
So if some bit of speculation about Sansa makes a reader fetch his or her smelling salts, well, given the way the books are going, that suggests it's that much more likely to happen and therefore worthy of discussion, no matter how uncomfortable it might make some. Littlefinger or some other character attempting to rape Sansa would be pretty small potatoes in the shock department: rape attempts are old hat for Sansa. Even Littlefinger forcibly raping Sansa would be relatively tame (especially by the standard GRRM set in ADWD in terms of ramping up the disturbing material). Littlefinger successfully "seducing" Sansa or Sansa "seducing" Littlefinger, on the other hand...now that would fuck readers up, much like Arya being molested and using the promise of sex to lure her victim did when the Mercy chapter was released.
Â 
The other thing to bear in mind is that Arya and Sansa's training arcs are very closely linked in that they seem to be learning much the same skills, even if Sansa's training is ostensibly political and Arya's training is assassin training. The FM drill Arya in the art of observing others and picking up important bits of information, and Littlefinger does the same when quizzing Sansa about Lyn Corbray (although his "training" is a lot more half-assed than the FM's methodical instruction). Arya learns the lying game to discern and tell lies, Sansa is forced to up her own lying game. Arya learns how to adopt different personas and even starts thinking about the different personalities of those identities (Mercy smiles and eats fruit and is easy to get along with, e.g.), while Sansa refines and gives serious thought to her Alayne persona, almost as if Alayne is a real person (Alayne is "bastard brave" unlike the "frightened" Sansa, Sansa's not sure if Alayne likes dancing as Sansa did, etc.). And so on.
Â 
So, with all that about the similarities between Arya and Sansa's skill sets, and parallels in their training...now that Arya has started using her sexuality as a weapon (albeit outside her training), what does that say about the chances that Sansa will do the same thing? And if GRRM is subjecting prepubescent Arya to that kind of treatment, what would the equivalent of that kind of treatment be for a 13-year-old Sansa?
Â 
Â 
So, the only thing she might enjoy is rape or attempt of rape. How very progressive, empowering and feminist of her would that be.
Â 
Because Dany coming to enjoy her rapes and eventually falling in love with her rapist was so progressive, empowering and feminist. Oh, wait, it wasn't. And yet, GRRM wrote it that way and apparently seems to have viewed it that way.
Â 
The fans' convictions that GRRM would never write X thing because they don't consider it sufficiently progressive/empowering/feminist for the character are irrelevant, since they're not the ones writing this thing and their opinions as to what's sufficiently "feminist" to go in the books are therefore irrelevant. What matters is what GRRM considers progressive/empowering/feminist, and he has...interesting ideas about such things, if his treatment of female characters in ASOIAF is any indication, a treatment many feminist posters on these and other boards can and have found problematic at best and offensive or sexist at worst.
Â 
Also, after GRRM 1) portrayed one of the few female rulers as a spiteful, insanely jealous, murderous shrew and a figure worthy of scorn and ridicule, 2) dedicated the better part of an entire book to showing how ridiculously incompetent one of the most powerful women in his series was, and 3) proceeded to showcase the other most powerful woman in the series mooning over a boy instead of attending to governance and making mistake after mistake after mistake in the next volume, I find the idea that GRRM writes with no other object than feminist ideals in mind touchingly naive.
Â 
Â 
Then we have this Sansa using sex as weapon. People, have you actually read her chapters? Like, really read? We are speaking about girl whose every encounter with sexuality has been more than tragic. And suddenly, she will transform into seductress a la Cersei, using her body as leverage.
Â 
Well, since you've read the books, you must remember Dany's chapter, where she goes from terrified, sexually abused, traumatized 13-year-old child "whose every encounter with sexuality [had] been more than tragic" on the verge of suicide to someone who coolly and calmly makes a calculated decision to learn sexual techniques and to seduce Drogo for her own purposes within the very same chapter. If you accept as accurate the speculation that Sansa's entire ASOIAF arc is essentially a long-form version of Dany's in that bit of AGOT where she goes from meek, traumatized, scared shitless abuse victim to badass, sexually confident, seductress khaleesi within the space of a single chapter, then yes, she will "suddenly transform into [a] seductress a la [Dany]," just as Dany did in AGOT.
Â 
Â 
And then, people speak about this being empowerment and feminism
Â 
Eh, it's a mixed bag in the books in terms of the depiction of players using their sexuality: Arianne using Arys is painted as sketchy, Cersei seducing Osney as rewards for favours is presented as another one of Cersei's spectacularly ill-advised decisions, Littlefinger prostituting himself to Lysa is treated as both sinister and as humorous (Sansa listening to Lysa's howls of ecstasy), Bronn selling himself to the Stokeworths is treated as a jolly affair, Alys is none too thrilled about being shuffled into a marriage to Sigorn and bitches about wildlings in her bedchamber but nonetheless drags him out to the dance floor in the end, etc. Sometimes, however, characters using their sexuality as a tool is occasionally sold as an "empowering" act by GRRM--Dany seducing Drogo, her rapist and captor, supposedly marking her transformation into a powerful woman, Alys making the best of Jon prostituting her with her confident "Let [Sigorn] be afraid of me," Arya trading on her sexuality to murder Raff (assuming we're supposed to see that as awesome and badass)--which is worthy of note when we're speculating.about what GRRM might have in mind for Sansa.

Â 
Â 
Bronn selling himself to the Stokeworths may be treated as a jolly affair for Bronn in the books. Â I always wondered how poor Lollys, after surviving gang-rape and the pregnancy that resulted, would feel about the marriage bed; and just hoped (as much as one can hope when thinking of a fictional character) that Bronn was kind to her and didn't rush her into doing her marital duty. Â 
Â 
I don't necessarily view Dany's seducing Drogo, her rapist and captor, as the mark of her transformation into a powerful woman. Â She was married to him, by the will of her only family, who was also her older brother and liege-lord; and did not have a way out of the marriage. Â I think of Dany's seduction of Drogo as a sign of her determination to make a frightening and rather miserable situation more bearable. Â It was Dany's determination, and not necessarily her use of it to seduce her husband; that eventually made her become more powerful. Â She sought to improve her life within the bounds of her marriage, regardless of the unfairness, and learn as much as she could about her husband, his life and his culture, not just make their sexual encounters easier. Â 
Â 
But Sansa is not in the same position. Â Littlefinger is not her husband; there is no social/cultural/familial pretext for her to submit to his advances when she clearly (at least in the book) does not appreciate them, or at least not to submit fully and sexually. Â There's a huge difference in manipulating a nervous child prone to dangerous fits into compliance by allowing him to kiss her on the cheek and allowing Littlefinger, or any man Sansa does not want, to take sexual liberties with her. Â And it is to be hoped that if Sansa ever marries, she will come to the marriage bed of her own free will with a kind and understanding husband. Â Just because terrible things happen to many female characters in ASoIaF does mean we should have to see all the female characters degraded. Â 
Â 
I don't think all women have to advance themselves only by having sex with people they would otherwise not want. Â It really would depend on the situation. Â I don't see why we have to expect Sansa to have an either/or situation of either continuing to be a passive innocent manipulated by players or Sansa seducing her way to power by having sex with Littlefinger and other men or women she does not want. Â There are ways between the extremes. Â Sansa is a beautiful and intelligent and extremely observant girl. Â Flirting could take her a long way, as can learning how the lords and ladies of the Vale interact and what secrets they keep (which she is already doing). Â 
Â 
It's GRRM's party, he can certainly write what he wants to write. Â But Sansa is one of my favorite characters; and I still hope that she will not have to resort to having unwanted sex to fulfill her potential. Â

4447	Zorn Gottes	2014-05-24	.........making Arya a killer...... who indeed uses sex as weapon......?


Arya has alway been much less receptive to their education, it was very clear since the beginning she was a savage girl and she was to find her own path. Sansa has always been an obedient girl who embraces her parent's values.

4448	Zorn Gottes	2014-05-24	And in the show...she knows even less than she did in the book. I mean, at least in the book she heard about Lysa and Petyr poisoning Jon Arryn and sending the fake letter to Cat and Ned. She doesn't even have THAT in the show. So, either the kid's about to turn into a regular Sherlock Holmes, or none of that information ultimately matters to her storyline.


in the show she knows that Baelish with her escape plus the necklace made her the main suspect for Joffrey's assassination, which means that if she flees she's DEAD. She's not a guest, she's a captive... again.

4449	Runaway Penguin	2014-05-19	I think this one deserves a separate discussion. It might look like a detail, but I would say it is important for future up in the great cold yonder.
Â 
When discussing how to prepare for the Wildlings, Watch hierarchy prepares to fight - with barrels of tar etc. What does Jon propose? Sealing the gate (even describing how to do it - which is kind of Cpt. Obvious for everyone). He is unhappy with Thorne deciding not to, because the Watch needs to keep ranging.Â 
Â 
So... Since when does Bowen Marsh look like Jon Snow? In the books, this argument came later... And it went exactly the other way. It was the First Steward who suggested sealing the gate and it was Lord Commander Snow who overruled it, because of ranging. So... Why the reversal in the show?
Â 
One option is to allow Jon to change his opinion after the battle of the Wall, but that seems a bit forced. Really wonder how they will manage to turn the story to get all the conflicts Jon has with "the old guard" in... Unless they decided to focus just on the wildling issue - but that would take the depth off the entire conflict.
Â 
It also bears another implication: Thorne and Slynt are for ranging here. That would make Thorne's remarks about Jon sending him on a ranging seem that less believable.
Â
4450	Matoro	2014-05-19	Well Jon was a whiny teen in S3 and suddenly he became great leader. D&D doesen't really care about things like this. Jon may be against rangings in S4, but it's all forgotten in S5 and stiatuion is like in the books. Just like S3E10 told that Stannis is going to the Wall, but it's all forgotten in S4 (apparently HBO hopes that the audience doesen't remember that and Stannis' arrival to the Wall will be a bigger surprise).
4451	Hypnomagica	2014-05-19	Yeah, they've pretty much destroyed Jon's entire arc these past two seasons so at this point I'm really not all that surprised. This whole season on the Wall has just been filler anyways, which makes the fact that the took so many short cuts during Jon's time beyond the Wall all the more frustrating.
If they had just taken the time to do it right to begin with, Jon could easily still be with the Wildings, just about to make the climb and the next season could start with the Wildling attack happening as it did in the books. Now its all become rather confused and it is difficult to really take the Wildling threat seriously as their size and strength is mostly just implied at this point.
4452	zaphodbrx	2014-05-19	You confused book Jon and Show Jon.
Â 
Show Jon knows nothing.
4453	TheEvilKing	2014-05-19	I think it's trying to show that Jon is the only one taking that threat of Rayder so seriously that he would be willing to take such extreme measures.
4454	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-19	In Season 5, wouldn't Jon's main reason to block that gate, ie the fuck off giants and 100,000 Wildlings, be gone, essentially? The plan is to make Jon look clever and Thorne dumb when the king of Giants busts through the gate
4455	TheCaptainSargey	2014-05-19	A curious decision. I actually pointed it out during viewing.Â 
I have to agree with the statement about Jon being the only one to take the threat seriously.Â
4456	TheHouseHB	2014-05-19	How about getting a first look at Yarwick?
4457	OnlyOne	2014-05-19	Bring me a block!!!
4458	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2014-05-19	I like this change. It (like other bits and pieces) are developing Jon Snow as competent leader material, thereby making the LC election far less contrived than it is in the book.
Â 
If you knew that you were facing an army in the tens of thousands, and you only had several hundred to defend, sealing up your defences is easily the most logical choice.
4459	Morbanth	2014-05-19	I'm almost certain that Alliser Thorne is taking Noye's place in the story. He'll die correcting his mistake, opening the way for Jon to be selected Lord Commander, competing only against Slynt.
4460	Tankbuster	2014-05-19	Who coincidentally has a very nice neck...
4461	Carne	2014-05-19	How about getting a first look at Yarwick?


Â 
Yarwyck is the character everyone has assumed is Bowen Marsh.
4462	Carcetti	2014-05-19	It's also interesting if they do decide later on to have Bowen opt to seal the gate and Jon being against it. This will show how different Jon thinks about situations now that he is the LC and it will illustrate how diffcult it is to make decisions as a leader.Â 
Â 
Or it's just to point out how smart Jon is and how stupid everyone else on the wall is
4463	Veltigar	2014-05-19	It's a way to make him look smarter now and more humanitarian after. Now, he's the smart guy who proposes to block the gates that will be smashed by the giant in ninth episode. Next season he'll argue to keep the gates open so that refugees can come back in, which show how compassionate he is.
Â 
Either way the whole decision is a bit nonsensical on the show. Why they don't just narrow the entrance so that only one guy at a time gets passed (which would make it nigh on impregnable and allow for rangings) is beyond me.

4464	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2014-05-19	If the issue come up later, you can get around it (literally) by having the Hardhome expedition being entirely via sea.

The below is from trailers, so you may not want to know what's apparently happening:

	Spoiler Aren't there clips in trailers of Tormund fighting Alliser, and of Grenn in the tunnel? Plus Grenn's support of Jon's suggestion could be ironic foreshadowing of the prediction by many that Grenn will be the one to die stopping the giant.

I don't think so. It would just be a matter of filling the tunnel partially. If they can do that for the entire tunnel, than they should be able to do that for part of the tunnel.
4469	joaozinm	2014-05-19	i am convinced. grenn will die with the giant.
4470	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-19	i am convinced. grenn will die with the giant.

ohhh i hadn't heard that one before but it sounds great!... but very sad, i mean i dont want that to happen to him but it would be good from a story stand point.Â 
Â 
IMO the whole blocking the tunnel through the wall thing is, yes, solely to show off jons intelligence and tragically clever mind. it is a good obvious thing to have rubbed in their noses also.Â 
Â 
im a little worried in how jons story arc is progressing this season also. they are making jon more assertive and actually giving him the chance to be the one whose seeing the right moves and trying to make them, which is great! but i kind of seems too little too late, Jon was made to seen like such a whinny emo little teenage screw up, its actions now almost seem a little hard to swallow. i understand they are trying, but it kind off seems like a cheap move, like -oh he's had sex and now he's suddenly a man and knows everything- or something, its just a little rushed and doesn't really do his book character any justice.Â
4472	Arkash	2014-05-19	IIRC, Jon wanted to seal the tunnels before the battle, it's only after it, when things settled and talk with the Free Folk started that he was against the idea.
4473	Mark Antony	2014-05-19	Â 
You shut your face! (But yeah, he totally will)
You shut your face! (Seriously shut up )
4474	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-19	I agree with most of what you said, but I think you're dumbing down John's progression on the show. It started when he went on the ranging. He coulda been as emo as anyone would want to call him back at Castle Black, but he came into his own north of the Wall. From Craster's, to capturing and sparing Ygritte,killing the halfhand,falling in love and choosing to honor his vows over his heart (paging Robb Stark). He's grown up quite a bit from the whiny steward from seasons 1-2 IMHO.
4475	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-19	sorry my quotes ain't workin for some reason.
4476	Yojimbo	2014-05-19	I like this change. It (like other bits and pieces) are developing Jon Snow as competent leader material, thereby making the LC election far less contrived than it is in the book.


Â 
Not having a go, but why did you think Jon LC candidacy in the elections (book) was contrived? Because of the Mormonts raven?
Â 
If you knew that you were facing an army in the tens of thousands, and you only had several hundred to defend, sealing up your defences is easily the most logical choice.
Â 
That was covered in the book aswell, when the wildlings started to attack the tunnel gate they dropped 'ice' barrels on top of there heads. When the barrels bonced and hit of the surface of the wall, 'bits' of the wall broke off, having tons of ice drop on top off the wildlings and closing off the tunnels entrance at the same time. Making the wildlings have to dig out tons of ice, before they could even try to open the gate, all at the same time as the Night Watch are raining down on them with ice barrels, arrows and burning pitch.

- It required Mallister and Pyke to act like idiots (if either had sought to verify Sam's story, it'd have fallen over).
- It required Jeor Mormont taking leave of his senses and leading most other potential candidates to their doom.
- It required the Night's Watch to be sufficiently stupid as to give the fingers to the most powerful man in the realm. With winter coming.
- It required the Night's Watch to be sufficiently stupid as to choose a 16 year old accused traitor. With winter coming.
- It required Mallister and Pyke (and everyone older than 30) to give up their last realistic shot at the LC job. Compromise candidates are normally elderly for a reason.
- Jon didn't do anything. He simply sat there, not even bothering to vote.Â

Â 
You can't aim properly from 700 feet. And it is far easier to dig through loose ice and snow than it is to dig through a properly sealed ice-tunnel.
4478	Fat Trell	2014-05-19	When I read the books, I felt like sealing the Wall wasn't a bad idea. Ranging seemed way too dangerous at that point, Jon kept sending the best men at his disposal off to die for information that didn't seem that helpful.
It makes sense to seal the Wall here. Odd that they made it a plot point though.
The bigger issue with Jon remains that he's such a sullen brat. Anytime he is refused anything he acts exactly as he did in aGoT when he was placed in the stewards. Despite all the growth he's supposedly undergone, he doesn't come off as an adult in the slightest.
Question; how would you reopen a gate once sealed?
4479	Yojimbo	2014-05-19	Â 
- It required Mallister and Pyke to act like idiots (if either had sought to verify Sam's story, it'd have fallen over).


Â 
So your saying two people can't hate each other? And not distrust each other? Who ever said being 'blinded' by hate made some one smart?
Â 
- It required Jeor Mormont taking leave of his senses and leading most other potential candidates to their doom.
Â 
Well, am pretty sure if Mormount had a crystal ball and actually knew about the Others (not just the wights) he probly would have had second thoughts about taking his men out to find out what is happening with the wildlings, why his First Ranger has gone missing and two of the men who set out with him turned up dead, only to be reanimated as walking corpse's.
Â 

Â 
- It required the Night's Watch to be sufficiently stupid as to give the fingers to the most powerful man in the realm. With winter coming.

Â 
Well, the last time they sent a Brother out to King's Landing to report on the wights and ask for help, look how that turned out. Why shouldn't the Night Watch send out other requests for help, when they didn't recieve the help they asked for the first time, they where only given the dregs from there dungeons and they didn't even show up. When what they really needed is well trained knights and men-at-arms, Tywin could have sent men, he didn't he saw it as an insult and a sign of betrayal.
Â 

Â 
- It required the Night's Watch to be sufficiently stupid as to choose a 16 year old accused traitor. With winter coming.

Â 
You mean the same 'traitor' 16 year old, who reported back to Castle Black on the incoming wildling attack, stopped the wildlings from taking Castle Black and then held Mance's and his army back for several days until the rest of the Brothers returned from East Watch, who was a steward to the last LC precisely for the role for being tutored in leadership. Not to mention being as Ned Stark was Warden of the North and being the actual brother of Benjen Stark, I have a hard time believeing most north men in the watch believed he was ever a traitor anyway.
Â 
- It required Mallister and Pyke (and everyone older than 30) to give up their last realistic shot at the LC job. Compromise candidates are normally elderly for a reason.
Â 
Mallister a old man who propley wouldn't even see the next summer and Pyke who can't even read or write and is on the brink of the twilight years himself where the leading candidates, yet a 16 year old who could read and write couldn't do what they could do? I guess then if age is reason alone, then Alexander the Great must have been in his 90's right?
Â 
- Jon didn't do anything. He simply sat there, not even bothering to vote.
Â 
He did nothing? You mean dealing with Stannis the king who saved the Night's Watch and the realm from the wildling invasion was nothing? Or the fact that Jon even didn't have to put his name forward because his friends where making the effort of doing that for him.
Â 

Â 
You can't aim properly from 700 feet. And it is far easier to dig through loose ice and snow than it is to dig through a properly sealed ice-tunnel.

Â 
Are they just going to 'wish' the tunnel is to be sealed frozen shut? Where are they going to get that amount of unfrozen water water prey tell? Because if they are going to start melting snow and ice then, the Nights Watch better start chopping down insane amounts of tree's to get the fire's going.
Â 
And you don't have to 'aim', you drop a barrel off the wall perpendicular to the gate and let gravity do the rest, what is so hard about that?. And I don't know where you live but when I've got to dig a few feet of just snow out of my drive-way when it winter it never been 'easy' work and that's with the benefit of not having arrows, barrels of ice and burning pitch raining down on my head..........I couldn't even imagine what it must be like to try to break up and clear blocks of ice that weigh a few tons and being assulted by deadly objects at the same time would be like............
Â 
And even if they did manage to some how block the tunnel with ice in time before Mance arrived, wouldn't Mance just go attack at East Watch or Shadow Tower, wouldn't the Watch have to start this process of all over again?

4480	NomadicDirewolf	2014-05-19	isnt it possible that jon may disagree with sealing the gate in the later situation? when that happens in aDwD the wildlings have been defeated an largely broke, and although they still pose a threat, jon maintains a hope of bringing them through the wall to fight with them against the WW, which they would need the gate to do. Right now, thats unlikely to happen, cos the wildlings havent been defeated, and Mance still leads them, and he wouldnt agree to that proposal.Â
4481	The Unborn	2014-05-19	I don't think so. It would just be a matter of filling the tunnel partially. If they can do that for the entire tunnel, than they should be able to do that for part of the tunnel.

If you block the entrance so that only one man at a time could pass, how the horses are gonna get through ?
4482	Chebyshov	2014-05-19	isnt it possible that jon may disagree with sealing the gate in the later situation? when that happens in aDwD the wildlings have been defeated an largely broke, and although they still pose a threat, jon maintains a hope of bringing them through the wall to fight with them against the WW, which they would need the gate to do. Right now, thats unlikely to happen, cos the wildlings havent been defeated, and Mance still leads them, and he wouldnt agree to that proposal.Â 


Â 
This. Unless Jon suddenly can see the future, the idea to seal the tunnel makes the most sense for the NW now.
4483	Frumpus	2014-05-19	Â 
Yarwyck is the character everyone has assumed is Bowen Marsh.


Â 
And he finally had lines for the first time ever. Though his delivery shows the guy was never much of an actor.
4484	Ruin	2014-05-19	Great Yarwyck intro.Â  There were a couple more guys sitting with Thorne and Janos.Â  I wonder if we'll get some more introductions in the last couple episodes.
4485	SeventySeven	2014-05-19	Honestly, regardless of what happened in the books, whether it was credible Jon would become LC, or what they've done with Jon's arc up to season 4 (a mess that's what they've done) I'm just sooo pleased with Jon this season. I think the lead up to be LC makes sense in the context of the show, and this Jon is miles better than how he was.

I think that's rather unfair to say. He has a few lines in season 1 and one word so far in season 4. Going by IMDb he has had a long career in Ireland.

4487	Runaway Penguin	2014-05-19	I like this change. It (like other bits and pieces) are developing Jon Snow as competent leader material, thereby making the LC election far less contrived than it is in the book.
Â 
If you knew that you were facing an army in the tens of thousands, and you only had several hundred to defend, sealing up your defences is easily the most logical choice.


I disagree. Gate is narrow, easily defensible - and naturally channeling enemy strength into killing ground. Block it and enemy, once he finds himself without the gate, will go over the Wall. Plus sealing the gate robs you of your eyes and ears in the wilderness. It would make even more sense to block the Gate after Wildling defeat, when it was the Others out there... Yet Lord Commander made decision not to block it. Against bigger threat.Â 
It is just inconsistent with the character. If the writers want to show it as "smart move, because Giant got through the outer gate", they missed the point. The dead giant blocked it pretty well.
Â 
Besides if it is intended that way, Jon will end up being a fool knowing nothing when Stannis comes
4488	Veltigar	2014-05-19	If you block the entrance so that only one man at a time could pass, how the horses are gonna get through ?


I meant block the entrance so that one man, leading his garron by hand could get through
4489	Runaway Penguin	2014-05-19	For that it is better to barricade exit (which actually was result of the ice fall when the stairs burned in the book) - no need to block the tunnel, actually you want enemies in that killing ground. Block them at the exit, then pour all kids of nasty stuff through murder holes in the ceiling. Plus you had two additional grilles inside the tunnel.
Â 
Kind of why sometimes garrisons of forts did not repair breaches, it was better to know where the enemy main effort came. So instead the breaches were trapped and mined...
4490	sj4iy	2014-05-19	In Season 5, wouldn't Jon's main reason to block that gate, ie the fuck off giants and 100,000 Wildlings, be gone, essentially? The plan is to make Jon look clever and Thorne dumb when the king of Giants busts through the gate


Â 
^This. Â In any case, Marsh's suggestion was long after the battle with the Wildlings...Jon isn't suggesting it in the same scenario.
4491	King Tommen	2014-05-19	"We've got 100 men to defend this entrance against an army of 100,000. Maybe sealing the entrance shut makes the most sense."
Â 
"We may want to ride our horses into the middle of buttfuck nowhere after this whole epic confrontation is finished with and we totally win with our 100 men, so I think that entrance should stay open just in case we feel like doing that."

4493	Fat Trell	2014-05-19	To be fair; sealing the gate would have just meant Mance would have marched elsewhere. Forcing Mance to march on the Shadow Tower or Eastwatch would have spread the Watch thinner. Better to have them attack a known defensible position then 2 or more less defensible ones on the opposite sides of a continent.
Â 
Frankly the situation shouldn't be nearly as dire on the show given that Marsh never marched off to the Bridge of Skulls with most of the remaining garrison.

Â 
Jon's right in that they don't have the manpower to stop the Wildlings. Â The Giants are capable of tearing out the gate if they are given the opportunity (we see the gate break in the books because of Mag the Mighty's attack on it). Â No matter what they do, 100 men isn't enough to defend the gate from an attack on both sides. Â I guess we'll see how it plays through, though. Â I don't like judging too quickly based on one short scene in this episode when we still have two more episodes to go.
4495	Darryk	2014-05-19	I think it's trying to show that Jon is the only one taking that threat of Rayder so seriously that he would be willing to take such extreme measures.


Â

Â 
These.
Â 
Jon's plan is the right one, and will probably be proven so when the giant attacks the gate in episode 9. The point is to show his competent leadership abilities not being acknowledged by the elitists of the NW.
Â 
Criticizing the change based on story threads that may or may not happen in season 5 is jumping the gun somewhat. We really don't know if Bowen Marsh and Jon will ever have that discussion in the show, or if Marsh will even feature at all.
4496	Ser Oromus Locke	2014-05-19	Yeah, they've pretty much destroyed Jon's entire arc these past two seasons so at this point I'm really not all that surprised. This whole season on the Wall has just been filler anyways, which makes the fact that the took so many short cuts during Jon's time beyond the Wall all the more frustrating.
If they had just taken the time to do it right to begin with, Jon could easily still be with the Wildings, just about to make the climb and the next season could start with the Wildling attack happening as it did in the books. Now its all become rather confused and it is difficult to really take the Wildling threat seriously as their size and strength is mostly just implied at this point.


Â 
What are you talking about? Why should the next season start with the wildling attack "as it did in the books"? The wildlings came at the end of Book3, not the beginning of Book5..
Â 
And about it being confused, I think it's pretty darn clear. Jon is constantly referring to the threat from the beyond the Wall, even going as far as going after the mutineers to keep their secrets, and we've been reminded of the wildlings south of the Wall as well. LIterally everything Jon Snow this season has been saying to viewers: There's a clash coming from both the North and South of the Wall. What this season isn't telling us is that Stannis is going to arrive just in time, though this episode kinda did tell us that Mel, Selyse and Shireen are also moving away from Dragonstone.. anybody with a bit of memory would remember where to.
Â 
Implied strength? Pretty sure they've been saying 100000 men + giants this entire time. That's not implied, that's explicitly stated. Not to mention that Jon has stated to Ygritte that the wildlings are largely untrained. In my personal opinion, the remarks we get on the Wildling host are extremely close to the ones we get in the book: They have large numbers (in the show explicitely stated, dunno if that was true in the books), but the majority of their host is filled with women and children that have also left their homes.
Â 
I don't think Jon's storyline has been destroyed. Far from it, yes they've added that Craster's Keep-plot, and effed up with Sam, but if you really want to want to take a gander at a top three of destroyed storyline, then that pretty much was all Sam, Sam and Sam.
Â 


Â 
Yarwyck is the character everyone has assumed is Bowen Marsh.


Â 
This left me confused as well..
Â 


The below is from trailers, so you may not want to know what's apparently happening:

	Spoiler Aren't there clips in trailers of Tormund fighting Alliser, and of Grenn in the tunnel? Plus Grenn's support of Jon's suggestion could be ironic foreshadowing of the prediction by many that Grenn will be the one to die stopping the giant.



Â 
Noooooo!!!!!!! Not him! This season is going to leave the cast in shambles! :'(
Â 
I mean they already killed off Rorge and Biter! :'(
Â

This is Mance's strategy in the books, maybe they already have sent Bowen to the Shadow Tower to deal with this strategy?
4497	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-05-19	How about getting a first look at Yarwick?

I wonder what would have happened if Jon had been all, "Yes, Lord Alliser, that's a brilliant idea. We need to have that tunnel open at all costs."It kind of fits with Alliser's personality though. He seems to dislike Jon because Jon isn't his friend despite both of them being one of the few aristocrats on the Wall.

I think it's more that he feels threatened by Jon. Â Here's a guy that, before Jon came, was essentially the next-in-line for Lord Commander.

Alliser was at no point next in line to be Lord Commander. At the time of the choosing his name is never even mentioned iirc. And that was after multiple strong candidates(Qhorin Halfhand, Benjen Stark, Jeremy Rykker, etc.) had all been killed off in rapid succession.

The GoT Wiki guys (who are in no way affiliated with the show) are the ones who jumped to that conclusion in S1 and the rest of the fanbase ran with it. Brian Fortune was never referred to as anything other than "man of the Night's Watch" in the credits or by anyone associated with the show. They decided to make him Yarwyck this season.
Â 
The Bowen Marsh stuff was never a thing. Just some overzealous fans jumping to conclusions.
4507	Runaway Penguin	2014-05-20	It is clear that Thorne is trying to get Jon into open defiance and then on chopping block, but that is not the question here... The question is why an aggressive young man (who moreover knows that Wall can be climbed even by quite substantial group of men) suddenly turned into "let's seal off the tunnel and sit on the top"...Just cannot help to feel that a. this goes completely against Jon as LC in the books (after all the suggestion made much more sense when there were already no substantial human populations to the North and this mythical enemy coming in). Thorne's position is simply that of a skilled soldier who knows the value of tactics and reconnaissance, while Jon's idea (series wise) is the Maginot Line thinking.Â 
Â 
Yes, the Giant broke through the outer gate in the book. That just meant that had 3 more gates and a barricade to go - and he was stopped on the first of the inner gates, effectively blocking the tunnel. What was the bigger threat to NW was running out of weapons - and that threat would be much more pronounced if they had to stretch defenses over wider area than the mile or so to each side of castle Black, concentrating on the gate. Block the gate... And you then have to defend much bigger length of the Wall. Plus, if the enemy decides to move out and strike elsewhere (after all Mance MIGHT know about the secret passage), you cannot send out patrols to track him as the gate will be shut.
Â 
Dunno, it just feels weird to me to have "cautious old men" emphasizing active defense and Jon going the "old man's way".this way, if the discussion gets ever revisited, it would seem that Jon changed his mind "just to be against Thorne again".
Â 
(Another weird thing, as I already mentioned, is describing the process of blocking the gate like he was explaining an unknown concept... If anything, it should have been the First Builder to tell the method)

Well, it seems the actor himself was under the impression at the time his 'character' would/could come back and he would like to see his 'character' come back into it because there so many directions it could go in and the characters are all so fleshed out and by the fact the 'character' he played in season 1, plays the exact same role Bowen played in Game of Thrones (book).
Â

Â 
But of course it just us overzealous book fans right? "Man of the Nights Watch" was actually going to be Azor Ahai reborn! "The prince that was promised!"........................or more likely he was Bowen Marsh but the writers decided to scrap that character.

He also knows that the Wall will be attacked simultanously from the south as well - that's a big difference from the Book. He knows the Wall is vulnarable from the south so most of their manpower will be needed against the Thenns. He just doesn't want to take his chances against a giant opening up the gate for Mance's army while they have the Thenn-attack from the south.The reason why Thorne (and book-Jon) didn't want to seal the gate is the ability to go out ranging. Right now, there is no need for that, as Jon just arrived back, spotting Mance's army, so they basicly know everything they have to about that attack, even the timing. Right now, there is no reason to send out rangers.Book-Jon's situation was not so clear. He didn't expect a wildling attack within a week(?): he was waiting for the Others, and he didn't know anything about them - so it makes sense to leave the Gate open. Not to mention all those wildlings who may still arrive at the Wall and Jon wanted to avoid them turning into wights so he needs an open gate to let them through.

So your saying two people can't hate each other? And not distrust each other? Who ever said being 'blinded' by hate made some one smart?


Â 
Blinded by hate is one thing (though it is nice and convenient). That neither Mallister nor Pyke bothered to check the validity of Sam's story is quite another. Which is the point I was making.
Â 
Â 
Well, am pretty sure if Mormount had a crystal ball and actually knew about the Others (not just the wights) he probly would have had second thoughts about taking his men out to find out what is happening with the wildlings, why his First Ranger has gone missing and two of the men who set out with him turned up dead, only to be reanimated as walking corpse's.
Â 

Â 
The force Mormont took was both too large and too small. It was too small to hope to give battle, and too large to effectively scout. It made the Watch men sitting ducks. In short, it was insanity, but it had the all-too convenient effect of killing off Jon Snow's rivals.
Â 
Â 
Well, the last time they sent a Brother out to King's Landing to report on the wights and ask for help, look how that turned out. Why shouldn't the Night Watch send out other requests for help, when they didn't recieve the help they asked for the first time, they where only given the dregs from there dungeons and they didn't even show up. When what they really needed is well trained knights and men-at-arms, Tywin could have sent men, he didn't he saw it as an insult and a sign of betrayal.
Â 

Â 
Does Tywin Lannister have a good track record with the Watch? No. Is he the only guy in a position to send anyone North at all? Yes. Is antagonising him for no purpose at all unbelievably stupid? Double Yes.
Â 
Â 
You mean the same 'traitor' 16 year old, who reported back to Castle Black on the incoming wildling attack, stopped the wildlings from taking Castle Black and then held Mance's and his army back for several days until the rest of the Brothers returned from East Watch, who was a steward to the last LC precisely for the role for being tutored in leadership. Not to mention being as Ned Stark was Warden of the North and being the actual brother of Benjen Stark, I have a hard timeÂ believingÂ most north men in the watch believed he was ever a traitor anyway.
Â 

Â 
Jon Snow is the fourth youngest LC in eight thousand years, with the three younger ones being political appointments (i.e. relatives of the Lords of Winterfell). Since there are no political advantages to Jon (only massive disadvantages), Jon is thus the youngest "purely merit" appointment ever - merit that involved vanishingly brief service, and running off to the Wildings. That the appointment was made with winter coming on only makes it doubly stupid. Â 
Â 
Â 
Mallister a old man who propley wouldn't even see the next summer and Pyke who can't even read or write and is on the brink of the twilight years himself where the leading candidates, yet a 16 year old who could read and write couldn't do what they could do? I guess then if age is reason alone, then Alexander the Great must have been in his 90's right?
Â 

Â 
See above regarding Jon's exceptional age. Age and experience matter. Heck, why not Edd Tollett as LC then? He can (presumably) read and write too.
Â 
Â 
He did nothing? You mean dealing with Stannis the king who saved the Night's Watch and the realm from the wildling invasion was nothing? Or the fact that Jon even didn't have to put his name forward because his friends where making the effort of doing that for him.
Â 

Â 
I mean the latter. The election was entirely Sam's idea and project. Sam is the proactive one here - not Jon, who as is normal for his book incarnation, just sits there and gets everything handed to him without any initiative on his part. Other characters move Jon's storyline along for him. Thank goodness TV!Jon is different.
Â 
Â 
Are they just going to 'wish' the tunnel is to be sealed frozen shut? Where are they going to get that amount ofÂ unfrozen waterÂ water prey tell? Because if they are going to start melting snow and ice then, the Nights Watch better start chopping down insane amounts of tree's to get the fire's going.
Â 

Â 
Seeing as the idea is mooted in both book and show, and no-one complains about lack of wood, I think its feasibility is without question.
Â 
And you don't have to 'aim', you drop a barrel off the wall perpendicular to the gate and let gravity do the rest, what is so hard about that?. And I don't know where you live but when I've got to dig aÂ few feetÂ ofÂ just snowÂ out of my drive-way when it winter it never been 'easy' work and that's with the benefit of not having arrows, barrels of ice and burning pitch raining down on my head..........I couldn't even imagine what it must be like to try to break up and clear blocks of ice that weigh a few tons and being assulted by deadly objects at the same time would be like............

Â 
Have you got any idea how high 700 feet is? From that height, the accuracy of any attempted drop goes out the window (that includes arrows too - Martin doesn't realise how high 700 feet is either). And I repeat: hacking through broken chunks is easier than hacking through solid ice. By your own reasoning, would it not be more effective defence to chuck stuff at them while they're dealing with a much more daunting task?
Â 
Â 
And even if they did manage to some how block the tunnel with ice in time before Mance arrived, wouldn't Mance just go attack at East Watch or Shadow Tower, wouldn't the Watch have to start this process of all over again?
Â 

Â 
Yep. Wall 'em up. As long as the tens of thousands of Wildings are on one side of the Wall, their massive superiority of numbers doesn't matter.

Yes, and the point I was making is if two men who hated each other so much, that Mormont made sure they both where separated at opposite ends of the Wall, recieve news from a known craven like Sam, why would either men think Sam would have the 'balls' enough to lie to them and make sure his story checks out?
Â 

Â 
The force Mormont took was both too large and too small. It was too small to hope to give battle, and too large to effectively scout. It made the Watch men sitting ducks. In short, it was insanity, but it had the all-too convenient effect of killing off Jon Snow's rivals.

Â 
So making a tactical and military blunders can not happen?
Â 
Â 
Does Tywin Lannister have a good track record with the Watch? No. Is he the only guy in a position to send anyone North at all? Yes. Is antagonising him for no purpose at all unbelievably stupid? Double Yes.
Â 
Hmm so a man who already as a bad track record with the Watch, should still be the only 'king' they ask for help? When Bowen sent the ravens, they didn't even know Renly was dead at the time and if 5 Kings each can host enough men to contest rulership of the realm, why would Tywin be the only person in position to send men to the North to help? Also even if Bowen just sent a raven to Tywin to ask for help, how would Tywin be even the best person to get a host of men North?
Â 

Â 

Jon Snow is the fourth youngest LC in eight thousand years, with the three younger ones being political appointments (i.e. relatives of the Lords of Winterfell). Since there are no political advantages to Jon (only massive disadvantages), Jon is thus the youngest "purely merit" appointment ever - merit that involved vanishingly brief service, and running off to the Wildings. That the appointment was made with winter coming on only makes it doubly stupid. Â 
Â 
See above regarding Jon's exceptional age. Age and experience matter. Heck, why not Edd Tollett as LC then? He can (presumably) read and write too.

Â 
So the three other youngest LC's have all been relatives to Starks? And you don't think that fact along wouldn't at least sway men in the Nights Watch that if they vote fourth youngest LC it wouldn't be that 'bad' of an idea? After all the wall and the Watch are still around, so how bad could of the other three have been?
Â 
Yes, the same 16 year old who lead off a attack of 200 wildlings, then held back Mance's army for several days till the other 'candidates' returned from East Watch after being fooled by Mance is just the same as Edd right? On political advantages, well Jon getting pretty cozy with a man who could be sitting his ass on the Iron Throne and has around 4000 men at the wall
Â 
On "Age and experience matter" I agree to some extent, but look how the last LC with 'age and experience' did.....
Â 
Why are you keeping on saying winter is coming? Did GRRM write in the men of the Nights Watch know for a fact the Other are going to attack?
Â 

Â Other characters move Jon's storyline along for him. Thank goodness TV!Jon is different.

Â 
You mean the same TV Jon who only got to go on his stupid mission to Craster's Keep in the first place, was because Janos convinced Alliser to allow him to go because it would be a good chance of getting rid of "I know nothing Jon Snow"?
Â 

Â 
Seeing as the idea is mooted in both book and show, and no-one complains about lack of wood, I think its feasibility is without question.

Â 
Big difference is though, they have no idea in the books if the Others are even going to show up or not or when. They may actually have enough time to seal up 3 tunnels that are hundreds of miles apart and actually have the man power todo it with the wildlings help. Good luck with that with doing it with only 200 or so men the shows Night Watch have........
Â 

Â 
Have you got any idea how high 700 feet is? From that height, the accuracy of any attempted drop goes out the window (that includes arrows too - Martin doesn't realise how high 700 feet is either). And I repeat: hacking through broken chunks is easier than hacking through solid ice. By your own reasoning, would it not be more effective defence to chuck stuff at them while they're dealing with a much more daunting task?
Â 
Â 

Â 
Yes I am aware how high around 700 feet is and fully aware GRRM made a massive oversight in size. But being as wildlings are able to hit targets with arrows on top of the Wall in the books, why couldn't the Nights Watch not be able todo the same thing from the top? And if they did even freeze up the three tunnels, whats from stopping Mance from having his wildlings then from tunneling under the wall, through the wall or spreading out and trying to get as many fighting men on top of the wall? And how would the Nights Watch be able to defend against that?
Â 
Yep. Wall 'em up. As long as the tens of thousands of Wildings are on one side of the Wall, their massive superiority of numbers doesn't matter.
Â 
Yep, then deal with a 100,000 wights and who know how many Others whitewalkers.......brilliant idea. If we talking about the books then it wasn't even Mance's plan to attack the Wall head on, as for the show not sure what Mance is plan is yet other than making "the biggest fire the North has ever seen!"

4516	Mulled Wino	2014-05-20	It's a way to make him look smarter now and more humanitarian after. Now, he's the smart guy who proposes to block the gates that will be smashed by the giant in ninth episode. Next season he'll argue to keep the gates open so that refugees can come back in, which show how compassionate he is.
Â 
Either way the whole decision is a bit nonsensical on the show. Why they don't just narrow the entrance so that only one guy at a time gets passed (which would make it nigh on impregnable and allow for rangings) is beyond me.


Â 
Disagree. Â Jon will go straight back to flip-flopping after when he is leading the movement to let the wildlings pass etc. Â It makes him look much weaker IMO, but they couldn't possibly care less about consistency with regards to his storyline.

I mean the latter. The election was entirely Sam's idea and project. Sam is the proactive one here - not Jon, who as is normal for his book incarnation, just sits there and gets everything handed to him without any initiative on his part.

What is even more absurd is that Jon knew that if Slynt was elected for LC, this would mean Jon would be executed. Even this didn't make him act in any way to influence the election.He sat on his ass and moped, didn't even bother to vote.

He has NO IDEA Stannis is coming. None of them have the faintest hope of help coming since it hasn't come so far. They are facing a force from the North that outnumbers them 1,000 to 1 as well as a force from the South that could decimate their forces on their own. By sealing the tunnel, that helps to mitigate the danger from the former so that they can focus more on the latter.2. Stannis wouldn't be stranded, anyway. He would just need to take his forces back to East Watch and cross there (or the Shadow Tower).

That letter was sent out ages ago and there was no indication that any of the kings even read it. Even if they had, Stannis's power was broken at that time as far as anyone knows. It was lucky that he got an infusion of cash from Braavos but without that I don't think most people would have anticipated that his sellsails would even still agree to carry him to the Wall in time.What is even more absurd is that Jon knew that if Slynt was elected for LC, this would mean Jon would be executed. Even this didn't make him act in any way to influence the election.He sat on his ass and moped, didn't even bother to vote.Rereading those chapters, I get the feeling that Jon would have gone to Stannis if Janos had won the election. He ignores the election not to mope about it (does he even think about it during his chapters?) but to ruminate over Stannis's offer. The election is a small part of his inner monologue; he spends most of it thinking about his childhood with Robb, and Ned, and how he always secretly pined for Winterfell, but how he is horrified at the thought of having to destroy its weirwoods. Maybe he should have cared more, but honestly I don't think he did. I don't know if he was depressed or suicidal or just distracted.

Â 
^This.
Â 
That why am not getting these 'he did nothing but moped around' comments. Why would Jon even care about the vote? Over the last few weeks leading up to the vote; he betrayed his love for Ygritte, helped lead the defence against the wildling attack on Castle Black which got Ygritte killed and then held Mance's main force back for several days until the rest of the Watch returned from Eastwatch. What was his 'reward' for keeping to his duties as a Brother to the Night's Watch? Being branded as a traiter and deserter to the Watch, being sent out to parley with man who he betrayed for the Watch and who, if it wasn't for Stannis attack, would most likely have killed him. Yep, am pretty sure that would make someone disillusioned on how 'great' it is to be a Brother of the Watch.
Â 
Whats more, Stannis has offered him the chance to be legitimised to being a Stark, something that Jon has craved for most of his life. To be made Lord of the North and Winterfell, something he has only ever dreamed about and to raise a family, something Jon could never have in the Watch, but falling in love with Ygritte actually put meaning into his Uncle's words in what he would actually lose if he became a Brother. But at the cost of destorying the weirdwood tree/old gods that he, his father and family have been worshiping to for thousands of years.
Â 
Yes, he didn't do alot to get himself elected, but just by him having meetings and dealings with a King, I would imagine got the Brother's talking. If Mormont's ravan who says 'Snow' can push men who are on the fence on who too vote for can swing a vote, imagine how many other votes Jon won for himself just by having 'secret' meetings with a King, who just saved the Watch and the realm from a wildling invasion.

Alright relax no need to have people reread a whole book to answer a basic question, he sails to eastwatch and cotter Pyke, commander at EW, leads stannis and his knights thru the ranging roads
4532	SM4e	2014-05-22	Maybe they let Othell Yarwyck do the "For the Watch" scene. They can establish him as a loyal follower of Jon but who doesn't always agree with his leader's commands. Does it really matter whether the guy to stab Jon is First Steward or First Builder?
I doubt they introcused him now without any purpose.
4533	Arya Targaryen	2014-05-24	Or they (re)cast Bowen next season. With all the deaths around the Wall they will need new characters. I think we will get the election next season, with some East-Watchmen (I'm hoping for Cotter Pyke and Emmett). This season will end with Stannis' offer to Jon. I don't think they will have enough time for the election in ep10.And maybe the question of sealing the gates won't rise again, so show-only people won't ever know Jon was the one who wanted to keep the gate open (under totally different circumstances).
4534	Howdyphillip	2014-05-18	A single line in tonight's episode got me thinking. It was the mention of the order that was given by Daenerys to send Hizdahr to Yunkia to rule in her stead.I think that this will not be a major change to the plot, as obviously he is going to have to come back at some time and marry Danny.
Â 
Â What this does say to me is that he is probably completely removed off the possible suspect list of the Harpy. He will not be around for the time of the mini revolts now. Â
4535	Charles Phipps	2014-05-18	One doesn't have to be in a city to send one's agents to do dirty-work.
4536	Howdyphillip	2014-05-18	One doesn't have to be in a city to send one's agents to do dirty-work.


Well, of course it can be changed in the TV show, but in the books, there was daily changes in the actions of the Harpy based on the reactions of Daenerys. That would prove impossible.Â 
Â 
Â I personally think that the TV audience is going to be a lot softer in thier opinion of Hizdahr as a character and I think that means that he will not turn out to be the Harpy
4537	Lord of the Three Rivers	2014-05-18	I agree that Hizdar is not the harpy but I have always believe that Hizdar was the true Harpy's catspaw.
4538	Charles Phipps	2014-05-18	Perhaps.
Anyway, I assumed he wasn't the Harpy but the Harpy's puppet or advocate.
4539	juanml82	2014-05-18	Did she send him to rule? It seems to me that she sent him to warn the Yunkai masters, but not to rule.

The Sons of the Harpy are such a large part of Dany's story in ADWD that I would have thought they'd do a better job introducing them as a problem than that. "Oh, yeah, by the way, there have been some revenge killings but we don't need to tell you about that. BUTT CHEEKS!" They did the same thing with Dany's council in Astapor (minus the butt). A full season later they put in a throwaway line mentioning how it failed. "By the way, that council you set up that we've never talked about or hinted at before? Yeah it failed and now some guy named Cleon is being mean."It's rather frustrating. Is it really that difficult to lay the groundwork for these things by having 15-30 seconds of dialogue? But it does cut into the precious Boob TimeÂ<U+0099> so I guess that's probably why. My hopes of them actually managing to properly tackle the complexities of the situation in Meereen pretty much went out the window with this episode.

I'm okay with the throw-away introduction of the trouble at Astapor, mostly because we're not going to spend much more time there. It's more of a distant problem for Dany that only comes to bite her once the pale mare arrives. The revenge killings on the other hand... see my point above. I don't know what they were thinking introducing something that close to Dany'S current storyline like that.
Â 
Â 
As for Hizdahr being sent to Yunkai, she's sending him there as an ambassador, hoping that he, being a master, will convince the other masters not to throw their lies away. Personally, I thinks it's more than likely that he will betray her, encourage Yunkai to attack, establish connections between Yunkai and the Harpy and then come running back to Daenerys saying the masters threatened to kill him, or something. Cue more killings in the street, followed by his marriage proposals to stop the violence.

I think it just irked me because it felt like a retcon on the show when it's a very deliberate attempt by Dany to keep order in Astapor in the books. Book Dany makes a mistake that comes back to bite her later on but she at least attempted to create order in the chaos after the sacking. On the show, she just kills the masters and marches off. It's information that should have been dropped sooner, even if it was a short exchange.

I don't know what they were thinking introducing something that close to Dany'S current storyline like that.I agree. It's certainly concerning. They don't need to go into the same depth as GRRM did in ADWD to explain the situation (they simply don't have the time) but I'd still like to see Meereen handled with the same care as King's Landing. If we see that at all, I doubt it'll be this season.

"Let me kill your enemies"
"I have a better idea. Let's screw!"

Hit the breaks a little, guys! Give these characters (and the viewers) time to see that there's an actual attraction there. I did like that they made it so Dany was in complete control of the situation, though.

Â 
From the looks of things, Dany will wrap up all the useless East stuff ( slaves/Dothraki/other weird shit ) by the end of season 5, and finally spend 2 seasons in Westeros. Which is more thank you can say for the books.
4550	Matoro	2014-05-19	Maybe trying to reclaim Yunkai and killing all the masters will be the trigger that makes Yunkish and Ghiscari cities actually attack Meereen.
4551	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-05-19	Anyone else wonders, why Dany had choosen Hizdahr as her governor of Yunkai? She has just only once spoken with him and now gives him power over a
whole city, without Jorah, her most trusted counselor, even knowing about this?Â  Not very plausible.
Â 
I think they building up Hizdahr as the ruler of Yunkai coming back to siege Mereen and the second sons as turning their cloaks, so Tyrion can later convince them to go back to Danys side. But then why make Daario having a romantic relationship to Dany, when he is going to betray her anyway? Just so that it seemes more "mean" of him? Also not very well written.

And third: did Jorah at any time just straightforward admit to Dany, that he was a slaver in the books? I can't remember
Â 
In my opinion, they are handling things in Mereen quite too fast, so theres no time to build up real plots.

Yeah, it's very strange... First Qarth was taken out of the picture in season two, then she got control of the Meereenese navy, and now she's stopping the Yunkai'i before they can reclaim Astapor and march to Meereen? It looks like they're taking out all the things that led up to the (second) siege of Meereen and the eventual "Battle of Fire".

It looks like they're taking out all the things that led up to the (second) siege of Meereen and the eventual "Battle of Fire".


Â 
Depends if the Second Sons can actually take Yunkai. Yunkai has massive walls and the Second Sons aren't the hugest of mercenary companies.
4554	avernite	2014-05-19	I thought it was way too random and way too soon. We've barely seen Daario and Dany interact at this point. I get they have a nudity quota to meet but geez. Hit the breaks a little, guys! Give these characters (and the viewers) time to see that there's an actual attraction there. I did like that they made it so Dany was in complete control of the situation, though.


Crackpot: they wanted to show Jorah's reaction to it, but Jorah has to be exiled soon
4555	King Zee	2014-05-19	Anyone else wonders, why Dany had choosen Hizdahr as her governor of Yunkai? She has just only once spoken with him and now gives him power over a
whole city, without Jorah, her most trusted counselor, even knowing about this?Â  Not very plausible.

4556	ovis alba	2014-05-19	I was surprised Yunkai came up again already, but it might make sense leading up for the eventual battle to come to keep people aware of the other two cities that might have still some unfinished buisness with Dany. 
Â 
One thing I also find funny concerning Dany is that it sometimes seems as they would copy the exact discussion about the morality of Dany's actions from here.  Last episode with Hizdahr, they brought up the "but what if some of them actually were not directly responsible? How can she know without a trial just chosing randomly?" questions and this week with Jorah they did it again by bringing up Jorahs past and that he also used to be guilty of the crimes she now punishes without any mercy, while he is one of her most trusted advisers.

Â 
Thanks for clearing this up! Than it was my mistake completely.
4558	Morbanth	2014-05-19	I liked the change in the sex scene. They are showing a darker side to Dany - in tonight's episode, she sentenced thousands to die, but Jorah changed her mind in less than a minute. She's testing the limits of her power, seeing if she can do as she likes, being Queen and all.Â 
Â 
Right now she likes Daario like a toy. I think the whole falling in love with him arc will be in the fifth season, and that she will surprise herself by falling for him.
4559	Veltigar	2014-05-19	Â 
Almost positive that Daario will turn his cloak.


  Eventually that is. Just like in the books where it will turn out that he made a deal with the Harpy after a certain proposal of his was shot down.
4560	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-19	It seems likely Daario will be taking on the role of Ben Plumm and will betray Dany in the same manner as him. Why else would they specifically choose the main sellsword company that betrays her and make him its captain?
4561	DaveyJoe	2014-05-19	The producers really can't win with Dany's arc. Â To give a lot of the moments proper weight, details need to be fleshed out more.

Â I can't tell you how many reactions I've read that indicated a good episode... except for the Dany stuff, once again.

Dont give up yet. The battle will be at the end of season 5 and there is still a lot that can happen to make it work on-screen.
Â 
Personally, I liked that she send Hizdar. She's the one and only master with whom she had a conclusive discussion, the only one she knows even just a little bit. And I'm looking forward to what they do with him, really curious. The actor has got me a lot intrigued on the character.Â
4563	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-19	If they have the dragons flying around burning shit, I think people will care.  Or they'll just do as they've done with every other battle in Dany's story so far. Hint that there's going to be a big battle, switch to another scene, and come back when the battle is over without showing us any of it. If they do that for the second Siege of Meereen, I won't be pleased...
I think my only complaint with Hizdahr on the show is his unmistakable British accent. Why would a noble from Meereen have a Westerosi accent? That doesn't make sense. Then again, Missandei has a similar accent, which also doesn't make much sense.

I wouldn't be so sure about the battle being at the end of season 5 - I think they're trying to write around the battle, and I don't necessarily think that's a bad idea. I just think there's a very small chance of them getting extra funding for another battle only one season after the Battle at the Wall, particularly when it hasn't even aired yet.

The big events for every season's episode 9 is expected by the viewers at this point. They can't afford not to have something epic happen.
4566	Faint	2014-05-19	Exactly. Â I see little reason why they would not showcase that battle given the dearth of similar spectacles inÂ A Feast for Crows andÂ A Dance with Dragons.Â

Â 
People will care. Victarion (hopefully), Jorah and of course Tyrion will be there. And Barriston who I think will become another fan favorite in season 5 once he gets more screen time. It's nice to speculate right now at what is happening in Meereen but we still have episode 8 (maybe) and 10 to flesh out more details. Plus in season 5 all Dany has to do before the pit scene is marry Hizdhar and try to control the Sons of the Harpy. If the pit happens in say episode 7, 8, or 9 that leaves a lot of time for story development in Meereen.Â

I would think they would get the funding but I agree. They could easily just show skirmishes around Meereen and then show Tyrion turn over the Second Sons, Victarion landing and BOOM (John Madden voice) momentum changes and the battle is over. Â Don't need to spend a few million on a battle then and can use the money elsewhere.Â

No clue. Just speculating if they decide not to show the battle. 
Although they could use some of that money for the new cast next season. Lots of potential characters to add, but who knows.
4570	Old Man River	2014-05-19	A single line in tonight's episode got me thinking. It was the mention of the order that was given by Daenerys to send Hizdahr to Yunkia to rule in her stead.I think that this will not be a major change to the plot, as obviously he is going to have to come back at some time and marry Danny.
Â 
Â What this does say to me is that he is probably completely removed off the possible suspect list of the Harpy. He will not be around for the time of the mini revolts now. Â 


Â 
Good point.Â  But when Yunkai starts arming against her after he leaves it will raise some questions.Â  Still you can see how that would work.Â  She suspects almost everyone, he wasn't there and when he returns he stops the killing.Â  Yunkai starts arming up and he says "well I didn't get to stay long enough to finish the job."Â  Selmy is in the background being suspicious the whole time.Â  I like it.
Â 
I can't wait for the Kingbreaker chapter.

To me Selmy is the most interesting character in orbit around Dany.Â  And they're not using him as anything but an old guy she tells to shut up once in a while.Â  you're grace let me help take the city - No.Â  No man alive has won more single combats than I - Nope.Â  From experience I can tell you that mercy would be the right move here - that's nice but we're going bloodbath.
Â 
A little bit of him being Whitebeard and showing his humbleness.Â  A little bit of ass kicking here and there.Â  Having him hover over her like the body guard he is.Â  Those things would all be nice.Â  I mean isn't he more important than Daario ultimately?Â  And speaking of which, this guy they've got playing Daario now has no swagger.Â  He seems like the male lead in a Sandra Bullock movie.

Â 
Hizdahr is beng sent to warn the Masters of Yunkai that if they dont surrender Â Dany will crucify them like she did in Mereen. Â He is not going to rule.


Â 
What she thinks his mission is and what HE intends to do, or will find himself able to do are 2 different things.Â  Likely to me that Yunkai becomes a power base for him to push the marriage, and the Sons of the Harpy/terrorist/counterinsurgency angle isn't as important.

Well, CGI is not the only expensive thing. AFFC/ADWD are location heavy and cast heavy and those two things will also chew up their budgets.
4576	Veltigar	2014-05-19	And there are plenty of battles if they wish to show it. The Battle of Ice for instance
4577	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-19	Crackpot: they wanted to show Jorah's reaction to it, but Jorah has to be exiled soon I actually don't think that's all that crackpot at all. They've intentionally been mentioning Jorah's spying on Dany from season 1 (setup for his dismissal) and they've reintroduced the reason he left Westeros. On top of that, they've made a point to show how much his counsel means to her and that he's actually able to influence her decisions. Making it so Dany likes Daario in a way that she doesn't like him will make his exile all the more crushing and dramatic.It'd be crushing for Dany because she'll be losing a trusted advisor and everything he's told her will be questioned. And it'd be crushing for Jorah because he'll be getting exiled by the woman he loves that doesn't love him back in the way that he wants. A bit too soap opera-ish but that seems to be the kind of thing they'd do.
4578	Hard Hugh	2014-05-19	I agree that Hizdar is not the harpy but I have always believe that Hizdar was the true Harpy's catspaw.


Â 
In mentioning the temples...perhaps we are due to meet the Green Grace soon.
4579	Ser Oromus Locke	2014-05-19	So are we not getting a Shavepate?
Â 
Almost positive that Daario will turn his cloak.


Â 
When I heard that she ordered him to go to Yunkai, the first thing I thought was: Oh, so Daario has now morphed into not so Brown Ben Plumm. It's exactly what they needed to do in my eyes.. Oh, and Grey Worm will take Daario's commanding roles. I mean they even clearly established the sellsword motto in this episode, so it should be clear that he switches sides. Daario likes the two F's, but like my man Russell Brand has spoken, the one F, gets dull after a prolonged relationship and as he says, he can't get the other F in Meereen.
Â 
This thing with Hizdahr going to Yunkai is a bit weird, but it allows for the Meereen storyline to be stretched a bit until the last episode will reveal that Dany's plan has failed and that she's now cornered and besieged with zero allies, especially if she's dismissed Jorah.. ..and it will effectively push Dany's story arc in Season 5 into a higher gear, because of the constant threat. Whereas Dany is now boring, she'll be far more hardpressed and entertaining in Season 5, also because she can't swoon over Daario if he's become Brown Ben, having her needing to focus on ruling entirely.
Â 
Pretty sure they're casting Shavepate right now..
Â 
Ruling a city, and what does she have? A once legendary knight, a girl that speaks 19 languages and an army of Unsullied that have started to fall due to nightly gorilla attacks.. They'll need a few more to fill the "Meereenese camp".
Â 


Â 
I'm okay with the throw-away introduction of the trouble at Astapor, mostly because we're not going to spend much more time there. It's more of a distant problem for Dany that only comes to bite her once the pale mare arrives. The revenge killings on the other hand... see my point above. I don't know what they were thinking introducing something that close to Dany'S current storyline like that.
Â 
Â 
As for Hizdahr being sent to Yunkai, she's sending him there as an ambassador, hoping that he, being a master, will convince the other masters not to throw their lies away. Personally, I thinks it's more than likely that he will betray her, encourage Yunkai to attack, establish connections between Yunkai and the Harpy and then come running back to Daenerys saying the masters threatened to kill him, or something. Cue more killings in the street, followed by his marriage proposals to stop the violence.


Â 
I think they're actually taking their time to set Meereen. We need to think that things are moderately okay for her to sit there on her little throne, before it all turns to shift in the last episode, in which - like you what you're saying - Hizdahr will return with some lame excuse that they tried to kill him and that Second Sons have turned cloak (as the then banished Jorah foretold). It's sort of the same as the Jon/Bran/Craster-plot to me, and in this case, it is just stalling time and allowing for Daario to be morphed into Brown Ben - which means that we'll get Tyrion joining Daario at the end of Season 5. Daario is pretty big in Dance, but he's also often away on missions, for which they can use whatever Unsullied division leader they'll sort of establish.. The writers can easily use Grey Worm for those missions.
Â 
It's just an easy way to spread out her arc this season while already introducing some main characters for season 5 in like two episodes.
Â 
As for the revenge killings, it's the same as the goats in the earlier episode.. If they were rushing this storyline, then they immediately would've gone to Hazzea, but they didn't.. Same with the revenge killings.. It doesn't hurt to slowly introduce an issue that starts as a small issue. Remember that Skahaz reports that the killings increase? Well, they obviously do not start off with killing 9 Unsullied at a time..

Something I always thought about the beginning of Dance was that it felt like quite a few weeks had passed since she conquered Meereen at the end of Swords. This tailpart of the season feels to me as if they're filling that gap with a few choices that don't really hurt the following storyline all that much.
Â 


Â 
Yeah, it's very strange... First Qarth was taken out of the picture in season two, then she got control of the Meereenese navy, and now she's stopping the Yunkai'i before they can reclaim Astapor and march to Meereen? It looks like they're taking out all the things that led up to the (second) siege of Meereen and the eventual "Battle of Fire".


Â 
It's all to make it seem as if Dany's line of ruling is working until episode 10, in which the reveal will come that the Second Sons have joined Yunkai and that they are advancing on her: OOPS!
Â 
Just think of Daario as Ben Plumm after this episode. Second sons have the Meereenese navy.. Sooooooo, when they turn cloak for Yunkai.. who has control of the Meereenese navy? Not Danaerys', that's for sure. They're temporarily making it seem as if she's ruling well enough, but only for the next two episodes or so.. I'm pretty sure we'll see the Meereenese Knot in full effect in Season 5.
Â 
Really, I don't remember what season 2 ended on, but 1 and 3 ended with Dany having success. The Meereen-storyline is really all about her being backed into a corner on every front.
Â 


Â 
In mentioning the temples...perhaps we are due to meet the Green Grace soon.


Â 
I don't think so, probably season 5, along with Skagaz and Reznak, if those guys in the Meereen Assault scene weren't them already.. I think they focused on three separate Meereenese the whole time, one of which was Hizdahr, with the scrawny caucasian guy perhaps being Reznak and a big tan burly guy perhaps being Skagaz.
4580	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-19	I rewatched this tonight and I made a mistake. Daario is being sent away still. For some reason I had understood that he'd be staying behind, which wouldn't make sense given what Dany is trying to accomplish by sending Hizdahrz.
4581	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-19	Great post,Â Ser Oromus Locke. I love everything you said.Â Dany must face harsh realities, indeed. Being surrounded by enemies would top off having no Jorah and no dragons quite nicely.
4582	ohpooratlas	2014-05-19	If I remember correctly when the Harpy killings are first introduced in the books, it's kind of as a throwaway line as well, right? It's only after the murders persist and one of Missendei's brothers are murdered that Dany issues the order to double the patrols. And then later citizens of Meereen, freed slaves, Dany sympathizers are murdered and so the plot escalates. So we have plenty of time to get into the Sons of the Harpy plot.
Â 
I also think the fact that they keep mentioning the Graces means we will be introduced to them soon.Â 
Â 
Really not sure where they are going with the Hizdar in Yunkai thing though, but I feel like the invented material for Meereen has been solid so far so I'm going to remain optimistic for the time being. I'm sure Hizdar will be back. Dany will need someone to take Jorah's place on her council and we will eventually have to put some faces to the eventual opposition she faces.Â
4583	Joseph Nobles	2014-05-19	I think Hizdahr will "escape" from Yunkai to bring news of the Second Sons' treachery, and marrying him is the only way to shore up her control of Meereen. Any ambivalence about the marriage will be crushed when a shepherd shows up with Drogon's latest victim. Jorah will freak the eff out and Dany will send him packing, especially if Barristan chooses then to revealÂ Jorah's spy activities for Robert Baratheon.
4584	RoamingRonin	2014-05-19	Jorah convinces Dany to spare the masters of Yunkai. Hizdahr will successfully negotiate a peace with Yunkai but only if she marries him.Â
4585	Runaway Penguin	2014-05-20	Second sons betray her - she gets more paranoid. Ser Friendzone suggests something stupid, Barristan outs him. Murders begin. Hizdahr presses his suit.
4586	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-20	Dang, those are some serious over-simplifications. Sounds about right for their take on Essos so far, though.
4587	Tixu Oty	2014-05-20	I really like what they're doing with the Meereen situation so far. I like that Dany is settling down and getting into the political side of it all. For some reason, it seems much more appealing to me on screen than it did in the books.
Hizdahr isn't send to rule but to negociate. Which I thought was a great move since it's setting him up to be an adviser of some sort later on.
I don't think Hizdahr and Daario will be gone very long. I have no idea where they're going with this but I do like that they are starting to change some details around on the Meereenese plot. That stuff needed simplification and dramatization to work well on screen. I've read some of you think Daario will stay in Yunkai. That's good thinking guys, but it feels like it's kinda early for Daario to betray Dany, don't you think?
Also the revenge killings are the slaves taking revenge on the masters, as is depicted in the books (supplicants and stuff). I like that they also keep gently reminding us that things aren't all that easy inside Meereen either.
Â 
Â 


Just a quick question... Is there discussion of TWoW chapters here? If so, I will excuse myself from the discussion as I am waiting for the book to release to read it in its entirety.


I don't think there's been anything about it so far and anyways I have a question for you guys: Are we supposed to use spoiler tags when discussing WOW preview chapters? I guess it would make sense.
Â

I agree. I loved Huisman in Nashville but I have much trouble adapting to this new Daario. Skrein seemed so much more like a Daario to me.

4588	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-20	I'm not convinced Daario will betray Dany so early. He has no reason to do so when he's getting sexy time with his silver queen. I mean, he'd be a fool to betray her now. I expect him to betray her when the wedding to Hizdahr becomes a reality. That seems more dramatically appropriate.
I don't recall hearing about the temples at all. Just the vague revenge killings that weren't elaborated on.
I'm having difficulty with Huisman as Daario too. It's amplified by his excellent work on Orphan Black this season. Admittedly, he was given far more interesting material on that, and far more screen time. He also doesn't need to fake a British accent on that show and it greatly improves his performance. Never seen Nashville so I don't have an opinion on that.

Exactly and exactly. If Daario betrays Dany, which seems pretty likely, he'll do it when thing start looking pretty ugly.Â  Not only about Hizdahr but also on the war front.

Definitely. It seems clear that they've set him up to fill the role of Ben Plumm in addition to Strong Belwas (and maybe others) so his betrayal is inevitable given that. Daario's arc in ADWD works especially well with this particular change. I'm not a huge fan of the idea of him betraying Dany like this because it does seem a bit too cliched. But it's a convenient simplification that gets the job done and it's nowhere near as bad as what they did to Dany's arc in season 2.
4591	Faceless Man Friday	2014-05-20	I was amazed tonight at the throwaway line of "The Second Sons are patrolling the streets to stopÂ the revenge killings" or some variant.
Â 
Sons of the Harpy, or what?


In the book there were revenge killings over the initial looting of the City before the Sons of Harpy started their attacks. Â In the books the revenge killings were described by the supplicants coming before Dany seeking justice. Â Since they did not show all 200 cases to come before Dany as she ruled, I think they mentioned it in that scene to show there was still unrest in the city, but the Harpy attacks have not yet started.Â

Â Since they did not show all 200 cases to come before Dany as she ruled, I think they mentioned it in that scene to show there was still unrest in the city, but the Harpy attacks have not yet started.Â 
If they filmed such a scene, it was cut in the final product. There was no mention of anything like that as far as I remember. If any such mention exists, it'd be in the same episode where Dany crucified the masters but I don't recall anything in that episode about that either.
The first supplicant was the goat herd and second was Hizdahr asking to bury his father. Other than that and the throwaway line, we've had no other information about the state of Meereen since it was captured.
These are things that deserve to be dealt with onscreen, not in the background or through throwaway lines. More time on this sort of thing and less time on Night's Watch deserters and weak battles at the Dreadfort would have been ideal I think.

Meereen per se doesn't matter.Â  Neither did Qarth.Â  It's about Dany's arc while there, it's all prelude to what she is and who is with her when she returns to Westeros.

I agree that some of Dany's scenes have felt rushed this year, but I'm not sure I would cut Craster's Keep or Dreadfort stuff to make time.Â  It's all a delicate balance, the Craster's Keep mission especially seemed to be a crowd pleaser for show watchers, and it futhered Bran and Jon's characters.Â  The Dreadfort scene was important to emphasize Theon's broken identiy, even if it felt rushed.Â  The problem with Dany's story is the disconect with the plot in Westeros.Â  This is a problem in the books, Dany's storyline in ADWD was my favorite, but it's extremely polarizing and gets a ton of hate among book readers.Â  The producers need to keep Dany relevant and do justice to her arc but they spend too much time on it, they're going to frustrate viewers like GRRM frustrated readers in ADWD.Â  I am all ready hearing friends talk about how much they are starting to hate Dany's scenes.Â  I'd love to see Meereen be fleshed out much more, but the show needs to keep the momentum going.Â  It will be interesting to see how the arcs all play out when it's all said and done.
4595	Mad Monkey	2014-05-20	I think you can keep the momentum going while portraying Dany's storyline in Meereen. The TV show has the opportunity to do something that I think the book should have done, which is to show the situation deteriorating on the ground from the POV of someone on the ground. Instead of just having Dany sitting on her throne listening to intelligence reports from Reznak, why not have shots of battles in the street, freedmen clashing with Masters, Harpy's Sons slaying Unsullied, people arguing for and against Daenerys. This could be a good way to expand the roles of Grey Worm or Missandei, having them act as Dany's eyes and ears on the ground (or having them do it on their own, really).They could do a lot without having to worry about changing things from the book and it could be as fast-paced and kinetic as the Craster's Keep mission (which I honestly enjoyed). Part of the problem I had with the ADWD storyline was that it was very sedentary; I don't think Dany left the Pyramid even once until she married Hizdahr. It robbed the shadow way of assassinations and intrigue in Meereen of most of its excitement since all of it was relayed secondhand to her after the fact. This was logical for the books but it would make for terrible TV.

Â 
I agree that I would like to see it done this way, but I think the producers are afraid of spending too much time on a storyline that many readers disliked because of its disconnect with Westeros.Â  The show can make Meereen more exciting than it was in the books, but it still won't have anything to do with the War of the Five Kings or the White Walkers which are the main storylines that viewers are interested in.Â  Ever since Dany's dragons were born they've been waiting for her to swoop in and roast the Lannisters.Â  I think Meereen deserves to be fleshed out, but many readers got frustrated with it because of years of waiting for Dany to finally intersect with the other characters, it's a valid complaint.Â  I think the producers are eager to get her interacting with established characters so the tv audience doesn't rebel against Dany's storyline as well.
4598	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-20	There's no reason why they can't show us what's happening in the city. Reports worked in the book because GRRM wanted it to feel as though everything was spiraling closer and closer to Dany and she becomes more and more trapped as the book goes until Drogon swoops in and saves her. It's only then that she finds herself.
With POVs, he could convey that sense of claustrophobia and the enemies moving closer and closer quite nicely. That approach won't work on TV. Not directly anyway. There are plenty of ways they can give that same feeling to viewers. But to do that, they need to spend time setting it up. They need to establish the players beyond just Hizdahr and...well, Hizdahr. That's something they haven't bothered to do yet and it's unfortunate.
They could have easily kept the Craster's Keep material if they absolutely had to (I still think it was rather worthless) but they could have trimmed it down some. They spent a huge block of time over two episodes on that. Even cutting it down by 5 minutes (hell, cut it by 3 minutes) to give Dany's story room to breathe a little would have been enough. They even gave Dany a small council meeting not long after she captured Meereen. That would have been a great opportunity to really drive home the problems Meereen is facing. Instead, they made it all about her decision to stay. That's fine but they made it all about Astapor and Yunkai when clearly Meereen is having problems too. They could have used the problems in Meereen in addition to the reports from Astapor and Yunkai to really sell Dany's decision. It was a huge missed opportunity in that episode.
I agree that Qarth and Meereen are mostly about Dany's arc. But so far they aren't doing that. Meereen is just a locale that Dany is hanging out in. We don't even know the state of the city beyond a throwaway line. We've had two Meereenese in the story so far and both were supplicants. That's poor writing. Introducing a single Meereenese that tries to side with Dany would go a long way towards helping to give Meereen its own voice. I hope we eventually get that.

4599	DaveyJoe	2014-05-20	I don't think they want to show Meereen spiraling out of control because that will be her season 5 arc.Â  I think this season is all about Dany going from conquer mode to ruler mode.Â  Throughout the season she's realizing that ruling isn't as easy as conquering, and it will end with her chaining up the dragons and accepting that she's made some mistakes in her Slaver's Bay diplomacy.Â  Season 5 will be about fixing shit in Meereen.
4600	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-20	They don't need to show a ton of it. Establishing that there are problems in the city beyond some throwaway lines would help set up her arc next season. What we're getting, like we have all season with Essos, is core plot points reduced to a handful of lines with very little depth. In short, everything in Dany's arc is horribly rushed this season. Good writers should be able to write thematically relevant material to set things up for the next chapter by continuing to develop the characters. They give other characters tons of quieter moments and just give Dany badass scenes these days. This isn't good writing.
The point is they're rushing her material because they're spending too much time on other stuff. They aren't even establishing her situation very well with the time they're devoting to her. Her story is mostly an afterthought this season. The latest episode has done some to alleviate that feeling, and that's a good thing, but we still have large gaps when it comes to what's going on.

4601	DaveyJoe	2014-05-20	But think about the big picture, after season 5 they'll have spent 3 seasons in Slavery's Bay.Â  That's a huge amount of time, and the viewers are seriously going to get fed up with Dany's story before long.
4602	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-20	I am thinking of the big picture. I'm just not seeing how rushing through the introduction of Meereen in the current season will make this part of Dany's arc meaningful to people. I thought they did a pretty poor job justifying why Dany decided to stay. Sure, they introduced the problems in Astapor and Yunkai (pretty much through short infodumps), but they didn't think to mention that Meereen was actually having problems too? And then when we finally hear about one of the problems Meereen is facing, it's in a non-specific throwaway line in a scene more concerned with showing Michiel Huisman's ass. It's just...meh. Obviously it was a good scene for multiple reasons. I loved how Dany was in control like that and obviously it was good for people that wanted to see Huisman's ass. But beyond that the scene felt a bit empty.Since they were already planning to have a few of the early ADWD Dany chapters in this season, with the other Meereen scenes being invented to act as a bridge between conquering Dany and ruling Dany, there have been missed opportunities to flesh out why we should care about Dany's decision to stay.They've done a good job explaining what Dany wants to do. They've just done a poor job explaining why. They've glossed over all of the problems she has with the freed slaves at this point in the story. And they've reduced the whole "mother" angle to people lifting and carrying her on their shoulders (those lucky, lucky extras...), which got the message across I suppose but it was rather cheesy too.* The "what" is important but the "why" is even more important. They have the "what" down just fine. They just haven't done a good job with the "why." This has been a pretty consistent problem with her arc this season. Hope that makes more sense.* Side note: Barristan and Jorah should have been immediately dismissed for allowing the last known Targaryen to go into a crowd of people without an escort. That just didn't make sense. At all.

4603	Faceless Man Friday	2014-05-20	I was referring to what has been described as a throw away line scene when I said "that scene" in an earlier post. Â I was pointing out that in the books they informed us of the revenge killings through the supplicants but since the show only had the goat herder and Hizzie, I thought the show just wanted you to get a sense that not all is well in the city by mentioning the revenge killings in the scene that was shown. Â My main point was to distinguish the revenge killings from the Sons of Harpy attacks which have not yet started in the show. Â Someone's post seemed to infer that the revenge killings were the Harpy attacks and I do not think they are. Â The revenge killings are just that the revenge killings that were briefly mentioned in both the book and the show. Â I believe the show played it correctly by just mentioning them in passing as I do not believe they warrant any more attention. Â But by trying to point that out I have already brought much more attention than deserved either in the Books or the show.Â
4604	Shebara	2014-05-20	I also think there will be a great change in the Mereen plot - well they did not introduce the Green Grace (who is probably the Harpy) but somehow they will arrive at Danaerys flying on Drogon and at the Battle of Fire...I am sure of that!
4605	Jonny Boy	2014-05-06	From the looks of the title it looks like this episode will feature LF and focus on the evil genius. Could it be that this episode will feature the famous Moon Door scene and we will see Lady Lysa fly? Just speculation and prediction.
4606	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-12	From the looks of it, yes. Disappointed that it is this early, but understandable considering the amount of things that are going to be in the finale and that most likely lysa's death will be overshadowed by the other events.Â 
Â 
Though, in a way, due to the gap between this episode and next episode, atleast it will be a topic of discussion and will leave the show watchers wondering.Â 
Â 
Have to say, really excited for the snow castle scene. Didn't think they were going to do it in detail but by the looks of it, the scene will (hopefully) be given justice. Though it will be interesting to see how they handle it due to major part of it being Sansa's internal monologue.
Â 
And Lysa going crazy as usual. Already looks pretty dead on from the previews. Can't wait!
4607	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	Going from just the preview, the amount of Sansa/LF in it (snowfort, some LF lessons, and Lysa threatening to toss her out the moon door) my guess is yes Only Cat is happening this week and maybe where the episode ends.
Â 
My guess is its the climax to Sansa's storyline for the season and we don't see her again until the finale with some set up for next season. MAYBE a house keeping scene beforehand, but it seems its all happening next week.
4608	Aldi_AA	2014-05-12	I don't like it being in episode 7 it would've been a perfect transition from only cat to LS but oh well.
4609	Lord Carson	2014-05-12	As long as I see the Snow Castle, I don't care what episode it's in. So I'm content
4610	sati	2014-05-12	I don't like it being in episode 7 it would've been a perfect transition from only cat to LS but oh well.


Exactly. I wonder how they will set LS now. No transition and just a quick scene at the end of finale will work worse than going from Moon Door to this.
4611	HouseTavarez	2014-05-12	i think that the producers of the show dont want all the exiting moments of ASOS in the last two chapters.
4612	sati	2014-05-12	i think that the producers of the show dont want all the exiting moments of ASOS in the last two chapters.

4615	Lord Carson	2014-05-12	I think the scene will benefit from having the one week break. Rather than spending a couple days reflecting and the rest of the week speculating about the trial by combat, EVERYONE will be talking about this episode longer. I agree that it would have been a perfect transition to Lady Stoneheart, but I do think Only Cat will take advantage of the extra time. This is finally Sansa's big moment after becoming part of other storylines for most of the first three seasons. She's finally getting her own big twist and it'll be much more powerful with some breathing room and not buried under Tywin, Shae, the ship to Braavos, Stannis' offer, and Lady Stoneheart.
4616	HouseTavarez	2014-05-12	Yeah but why did they had to chose this one to be so early:/


Â 
i prefer this one over unCat apparition in episode 7 jeje.
4617	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	Yeah but why did they had to chose this one to be so early:/


Â 
When else do you do it? Episode 8 is going to focus on the Mountain and Viper fight. You have lots of stuff at the Wall in Episode 9, and a laundry list of events in episode 10. I don't have a problem doing it now.
4618	sati	2014-05-12	Â

As I said already, ep.10 as the scene before LS. But I'm sure OC will be a fine scene anyways, it would just make for elegant transition in finale.
4620	ebevan91	2014-05-12	I can't wait for this episode. I loved the Vale scenes in season 1 and the couple we've had in season 4. It looks like it's going to be a Vale-heavy episode!

4624	Colonel Green	2014-05-12	Also who will play the marillion role.


At this point I think we're most likely look at Random Guard.
Â 
Or the show has somehow written around the need for the fall-guy at all, which I have a hard time figuring.
4625	iheartseverus	2014-05-12	I do wonder if they'll reveal Lady Stoneheart right after the moon door scene, and end the episode there.Â  I know that's not the popular version of events here, but I can see it, and see the reasoning for it.Â  It smacks show-only views with a WTF????Â  And then lets the show sit back, silent, for two weeks while the WTF buzz builds, garnering more hype and bigger numbers for the final episodes.Â  IMHO, the season must end with Tyrion/Tywin/crossbow/whang, because that event literally changes everything in seasons to come.Â  Tywin was all that kept the Lannisters in power, with Tywin dead and Tyrion on the run, viewers will know that next season will be wildly different than anything they've seen until now.Â  Again, more hype for next season.
Â 
I agree with all those who feel that the reveal of Lady Stoneheart will be a shocker, a WTF element introduced into the Westeros world, but it is not, IMHO, a world-changing event.Â  It is the death of Tywin Lannister, and at Tyrion's hands, that turns the Westeros world upside-down, and I see that the season-ender, not the reveal of Lady Stoneheart.Â  Just my 2 cents.
4626	go joff go	2014-05-12	One thing in favor of doing it next episode is imo that this season has benefited fro grouping character scenes together over the check in with everyone approach we have seen previously.  Other is an argument that the scene will work better as the last of a series of scenes.
4627	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-12	Does anyone know why there's a two week gap between episode 7 and 8?

4638	Widows_Blood	2014-05-12	I can see why 'Only Cat' is in this episode. Without it, this episode is more of a set-up without anything huge plot wise happening. Its better to go into the two week hiatus on a high rather than a lull. Also, its kinda pointless to have all your bullets for the final episode. I think it would just be a huge overload for people to properly digest. Better to spread it out. Although, in my opinion, I would much rather have the duel in episode 7 and 'Only Cat' in 8.Â

And here, I WANTED it in episode 7 AND I get the snow castle (which, I didn't think they'd do). I am ear-to-ear with the smiles man. This good mood is going to last me till the episode airs and probably beyond. 
Â 
Another question: In the preview, I keep noticing Sansa keeps grabbing her left hand. Why does Sansa keep grabbing her left hand like it hurts? Speculations? I'm curious. Don't remember her hurting her hand during the Snow Castle scene in the book. Unless--in the show--she hurts her hand smacking the shit out of either Petyr (after the kiss) or Robin (after he destroys Winterfell).  Guesses?

It looked to me like she was just nervous or uncomfortable. Although watching it again, her face doesn't seem it. I know when I'm nervous or something, I usually do something like that with my hands, but it's hard to tell just from the preview.

4644	iheartseverus	2014-05-12	Could still be sore from when crazy Lysa was squeezing her hand.Â 


That might be exactly the answer.Â  Auntie was squeezing her rings into her fingers, very painful.Â  So, these after-images are reminding us that Sansa is 'being hurt' here at the Eyrie, that she is not at all safe here.
4645	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-12	Could still be sore from when crazy Lysa was squeezing her hand.Â 


Â 
Ah! Brilliant! Â  Could be.
4646	El Guapo	2014-05-12	Very surprised that only cat is going to be in this episode. I thought for sure it would be the finale.
Â 
I am also surprised but very happy that the snow castle is being included.
4647	Jinjonator	2014-05-12	So has anyone else wondered if they might change "Only Cat" to "Only Catelyn"?
Â 
A minor thing, but it crossed my mind.
4648	eliamo	2014-05-12	So has anyone else wondered if they might change "Only Cat" to "Only Catelyn"?
Â 
A minor thing, but it crossed my mind.


I don't think so. Show Petyr has referred to Cat as Catelyn multiple times IIRC. Plus, "Only Cat" sounds more punchy and quotable than "Only Catelyn."
4649	salmonsnake	2014-05-12	"Verily, only Catelyn, none other, yes-yes, off you go."

I swear, this two week hiatus is the one thing about the show that manages to piss me off year after year without fail.

"Speaking candidly, off the record, cross my heart and hope to die - only Catelyn Tully of Riverrun"

Another question: In the preview, I keep noticing Sansa keeps grabbing her left hand. Why does Sansa keep grabbing her left hand like it hurts? Speculations? I'm curious. Don't remember her hurting her hand during the Snow Castle scene in the book. Unless--in the show--she hurts her hand smacking the shit out of either Petyr (after the kiss) or Robin (after he destroys Winterfell).  Guesses?


Â 
She still had her wedding ring on in the last episode. Â Maybe it has something to do with that? Â Who knows...

4652	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-13	They really are spreading out the "Oh shit" moments this season, aren't they?
Â 
While I thought this scene would lead in nicely to LSH in the finale, I'm quite happy to see it a little earlier than expected!
4653	joachim	2014-05-13	Â

Really, where is it written that that's a wedding ring? It could just be any old ring.
4654	xandi	2014-05-13	I can see why 'Only Cat' is in this episode. Without it, this episode is more of a set-up without anything huge plot wise happening. Its better to go into the two week hiatus on a high rather than a lull. Also, its kinda pointless to have all your bullets for the final episode. I think it would just be a huge overload for people to properly digest. Better to spread it out. Although, in my opinion, I would much rather have the duel in episode 7 and 'Only Cat' in 8.Â 


Â 
I think it is great strategy to "spread it out". This way we have something quite exciting and/or surprising happening in every one of the episodes 6 through 10.
4655	Hippocras	2014-05-13	What are you talking about? What is Only Cat?
4656	Red Tiger	2014-05-13	What are you talking about? What is Only Cat?


Littlefinger says he only ever loved Cat when he pushes Lysa to her death.
4657	Hippocras	2014-05-13	Littlefinger says he only ever loved Cat when he pushes Lysa to her death.

Lies on top of lies.... (I don't think he loved Cat either, but anyway)
So "Only Cat" refers to Lysa's manner of death?

Precisely
4659	Javi Marcos	2014-05-13	My 2 cents: in this episode we'll have Only Cat + Lady Stoneheart hanging Freys
Â 
Then, in episode 10, Lady Stoneheart will hang Brienne

Â

Â 
Maybe the hanging Freys, but they won't blow their big last reveal with showing Lady SH already.
4661	Carne	2014-05-13	I can't imagine they'll have Littlefinger blame some random guard we've never met before. I anything I think they'll just have her appear notably drunk and then Littlefinger will say she stumbled or something like that.
4662	tyrell19	2014-05-13	I really hope its Mord!!! Think that'd be believable and explain how easily he could be manipulated once he's been arrested.
4663	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-13	They gotta spare Mord, they gotta!
4664	Chebyshov	2014-05-13	Maybe the hanging Freys, but they won't blow their big last reveal with showing Lady SH already.


Â 
I agree with that.
Â 
This feels so early though...guess we'll be embroiled with Vale politics for the rest of the season?
4665	King Tommen	2014-05-13	I think they've mentioned Catelyn enough this season (and will continue to) that there are several ways to get to the LS reveal in the finale without it explicitly coming after the Lysa scene.
Â 
The entry point is probably Brienne as well as the BwB who are all well-known to the audience so it wouldn't be a tough scene to transition to. Anything with Bran, Sansa or Arya preceding it would make sense as well.
4666	King Tommen	2014-05-13	Â 
I agree with that.
Â 
This feels so early though...guess we'll be embroiled with Vale politics for the rest of the season?


Â 
After this episode, we'll probably only check back in with Sansa/LF in the finale which will introduce the Lords Declarant. I don't think they're going to get too far into that stuff this season. They'll leave enough for S5.
4667	robdavies1775	2014-05-13	Pinning it on Mord would make sense from a narratively seeing as Marrillion is out of the picture...
But I really hope they don't do that, that would be so cruel!Â
4668	sati	2014-05-13	I do wonder if they'll reveal Lady Stoneheart right after the moon door scene, and end the episode there.Â  I know that's not the popular version of events here, but I can see it, and see the reasoning for it.Â  It smacks show-only views with a WTF????Â  And then lets the show sit back, silent, for two weeks while the WTF buzz builds, garnering more hype and bigger numbers for the final episodes.Â  IMHO, the season must end with Tyrion/Tywin/crossbow/whang, because that event literally changes everything in seasons to come.Â  Tywin was all that kept the Lannisters in power, with Tywin dead and Tyrion on the run, viewers will know that next season will be wildly different than anything they've seen until now.Â  Again, more hype for next season.
Â 
I agree with all those who feel that the reveal of Lady Stoneheart will be a shocker, a WTF element introduced into the Westeros world, but it is not, IMHO, a world-changing event.Â  It is the death of Tywin Lannister, and at Tyrion's hands, that turns the Westeros world upside-down, and I see that the season-ender, not the reveal of Lady Stoneheart.Â  Just my 2 cents.


Â 
I respect that reasoning and you are absolutely right about world-changing event but in terms of the story and shock value Stoneheart is so much bigger than Tywin. Tyrion and Tywin have always had this difficult relationship. A son killing his father is such a popular theme in fiction and I bet people predicted some of it. It's a major, major even and a terrific scene but in terms of a scene so shocking and cliffhanger so unexpected it turns your blood ice cold, for me nothing tops Stoneheart. It's the only scene that genuinely frightened me in the books and I'm sure her reveal on the show will be super scary and creepy too.
Â 
They have also been setting her up for practically 2 seasons - Bran's creepy dream, BwB, all the mentions of Cat. I'd consider having her anywhere else than as final scene of the season a cop out.

4669	Trillian	2014-05-13	I am fine with the Only Cat scene on ep7. Yeah, it would have made great material for the season finale, but there will be loads anyway, and I imagine Unsullied paying way more attention to the toilet scene or LS revelation otherwise. I like the idea of an episode dedicated to the Eerye (I imagine they would give it as much space as they gave to the trial in the last one), instead of minor bits spread across 3-4 episodes.
I also like how they are organising the second half of this season, each episode featuring a major event in different parts of Westeros (the Trial, Only Cat, the combat, the battle of the Wall and the Toilet Scene/LS) instead of leaving most of them for the finale. I heard a lot of complains, from Unsullied and not, during the last couple of seasons about not much happening in several episodes, usually at the beginning of the season and before episode nine (alsoÂ after episode 9, e.g.last season). This year it's definitely not happening, at least not after episode four.
Â 
Last but not least, for me it doesn't matter in which episode the Only Cat scene is gonna be as long as they deliver it in a way that lives up to my expectations.
4670	skorpion	2014-05-13	I'm sort of glad it's happening this week. Due to there being minor battles in the last 2 weeks, I think the trail by combat would lose some of its impact being in this episode. I hope the LS reveal might somehow be tied back to Nymeria seeing them pulling her body out of the water or something like that.
4671	King Tommen	2014-05-13	It's possible that the scene with the Hound demonstrating to Arya the gift of mercy is in this episode as the setting in the promo seem to mirror the "Nothing is just nothing" conversation Arya has with the dying man beside the cart we saw in the Foreshadowing video.

Isn't it way too late for Nymeria thing?
4673	Chebyshov	2014-05-13	Isn't it way too late for Nymeria thing?


Â 
I'm inclined to think so. Wasn't Cat pulled out 3 days after the RW? I think if we're getting any Nymeria, it will be a wolf dream for Ayra next season.

Agreed that Tywin's Elvis impression is the greater impact, but its a closer.Â  LSH is an opener.Â  So Tywin's Elvis impression will be Ep09, and LSH will either lay the cliffhanger for next season, or (I hope) actually open next season.

Â 
Well Sansa's hardly a fighter ("gently bred") and Lysa is fueled by the power of being batshit, so it's not shocking that she could get her in a compromised position (hanging out the Moon Door), especially given that the attack is surprising to Sansa.
4681	salmonsnake	2014-05-13	What exactly are the strength exercises Sansa has been doing? Lysa has been carrying Sweetrobin around for years. Sure, she's heavier in the books but Sansa being taller doesn't make a difference in that wrestling match.

You know, that actually hasn't been my experience as of late. I mean sure, there are ALWAYS haters. And those people are so far gone that Sansa could kill every single person in Westeros with one hand while holding a Lemon cake in the other, and to them, she'd STILL be "stupid", "weak" and responsible for every Stark death since before she was born.  But to "normal" people, I think she's garnered a lot of sympathy and 'positive' sentiments this season. Inbesides, after this episode, I don't imagine they're going to play her as being 'weak' anymore, so we won't have to worry about that characterization for long.
4684	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-13	That's because she's so stupid.. she's a stupid little girl with stupid dreams....

I understood this is not her first kissing on set, so why should it be hard to film? Kissing your colleague is part of the job description for an actor.
Aren't you maybe projecting your emotions about Baelish on the the actor Gillen and aren't you presuming prematurely that Sansa can find Baelish nothing but disgusting? Cooking a soup of dislike for Baelish with Sansa's alleged feelings and Turner's alleged dislike of Gillen? They are actors who act, remember! They do their job and will certainly have brushed their teeth. Though it  could be the other way round: Gillen dislikes kissing Turner since he gets a sore neck from stretching it and has to stand on tiptoe all the time

4688	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-13	As I said already, ep.10 as the scene before LS. But I'm sure OC will be a fine scene anyways, it would just make for elegant transition in finale.


I agree that it would definitely be better in ep 10, but if you think about it ep 10 is already going to have a lot of things happening that I wonder if they would have the time to include this too. The Tyrion rescue mission and visit to the Tower of the Hand has to be quite time consuming. Also there will likely be a lot of time spent on the wall with Jon talking with Stannis and the election of LC. I believe there is supposed to be a scene of Gregor to show what Oberyn did to him. Possibly Arya will be getting on a ship to Braavos. Bran is going to meet COTF and BR. All of it ending with the LS reveal.Â 
Â 
So I suppose it may have just came down to them having to choose which event they wanted to push up.

its not that she dislikes him. they probably get along fine. its that he was 45 and she was 17 when they filmed this. i get that they're actors, but its still got to be kind of awkward for both of them.

4693	franko99	2014-05-13	I don't know how to feel about "only Cat" so early, on one hand I'm really happy they keep the snow castle scene, and that being so early on the season, and with 2 weeks off, it will give time for the unsullied to analyze it instead of being overshadow by later events. But it also ruins the fact that (most likely) won't be followed by LS. Also I always though Sansa's last chapter was the perfect closer for the first "trilogy" (GOT,ACOK, ASOS), but it won't be the case for the showÂ
4694	starklinson	2014-05-13	Kissing Aidan Gillen difficult? LOL

4695	starklinson	2014-05-13	I'm just so excited for Only Cat idrc that it's happening now. I still think LS won't be until the last episode and it's going to scare the fricken hell out of viewers. There's not really much impact on changing the time it happens at.

4701	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-13	Well, Sophie Turner is underage sooooooo


Only if she were American or it was filmed in the US. Most places the age of consent is 16. Although I'm not sure what the legal age is for a kiss? Or really what your point was.

4703	Arkash	2014-05-13	It's mostly filmed in Ireland.
Â 
Reluctant at first about having Only Cat this episode, but it could work if they build it up enough (aka the last third of the episode taking place there at least). Then most probably we wont see the Eyrie again until episode 10.
Â 
What I actually do wonder is if we will meet the Lord Declarants this episode.Â 
Â 
And giving Marillon's role to Mord is the best choice the show have. And if I remember correctly videos and interviews from season 1, they had much fun filming with the actor !

4707	Ankou	2014-05-13	In the show Sansa will deliver a jump spinning heel kick to send Lysa careening out the moon door, and Littlefinger runs up with incredible urgency so he can cup his hands to his mouth and yell out the door as she nearly hits the ground, "ONLY CAT! BY THE WAY!!"

4709	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-05-13	I would like to see Sansa warg (I know, warging only happens when you enter a wolf, but I prefer that word to skinchanging) a little bird or a cat that will go and bite Lysa and momentarily distract her so that she doesn't kill Sansa. Â It would be a good opportunity to show that all the Stark children are wargs.

Either that or when she's building the castle have her remember moments from her childhood in her Winterfell and then all of a sudden she sees Winterfell burned to the ground while warging an animal in Winterfell. Â Littlefinger or Robert wake her up then.

I don't think they should change anything (except for the kiss, I think showing LF trying to kiss Sansa and Sansa managing to step away before he does it would be enough), I just want them to start showing us that all the Stark kids are wargs, not just Bran. Â And it would be ironic if they showed Sansa being a warg before Jon or Arya since we haven't seen her be one in the books yet. Â Then in episode 8 they could show Arya being a warg and Jon in episode 9. Â The trigger that activates their powers could be them being in danger. Â But of course I want Littlefinger to finish Lysa off. Â "Only cat" has to happen.
Â 
Also I like the Mord suggestion. Â Someone has to be blamed and it's unfortunate it won't be Marillion
4713	Arkash	2014-05-13	I would like to see Sansa warg (I know, warging only happens when you enter a wolf, but I prefer that word to skinchanging) a little bird or a cat that will go and bite Lysa and momentarily distract her so that she doesn't kill Sansa. Â It would be a good opportunity to show that all the Stark children are wargs.
Â

Â 
Wow ! I love the idea of Sansa having a warg/vision of a burning Winterfell during the snow-castle scene. Very unlikely but it could be very powerful.
4714	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-13	Side note: how would she see a burning Winterfell in a Warg vision? Its been burnt for months by this point and wargs see the present, not the past or.future
Agree with thr LF kiss. Not essential, so long as it is shown that he makes a move towards that. In the books she pushes him away after he has kissed her, I suppose its not massively different if she pushes him away beforehand . However, that makes less sense as to why Lysa confronts Sansa about it. The kiss allows Lysa's belief to be more justified

A burnt Winterfell, not a burning Winterfell.
Â 
Lysa probably didn't see Sansa pushing him away in the books either. Â All she has to see is Littlefinger putting his hand on Sansa's shoulder or something.

Sorry, someonebelse said burning and I thought it was you.
Lysa would need to see something fairly.intimate between LF Sansa, be that closeness building the snowcastle, an almost-kiss, actuallbkiss whatever.
4718	iheartseverus	2014-05-13	^ And it has to be something perhaps Sansa herself doesn't recognize for the intimacy it implies, since in the preview Lysa is screaming 'Liar!Â  Liar!' at Sansa.
4719	acacia	2014-05-13	Couldn't we have a lead up to LSH in this episode? Wasn't Beric cast for this season again, we haven't seen him yet but if he is in this season it has to be to show him giving his life for hers and I can't imagine them using that as the final scene in the season. Maybe we get a Nymeria vision as Arya is in this episode too?
4720	Colonel Green	2014-05-13	Wasn't Beric cast for this season again


No, not that I've heard.
Â 
And based on this show's style, they would not show the Nymeria vision anyway.Â  They would want Stoneheart to be a complete surprise.

I think it was Thoros that was cast - Beric is dead. It's way too late for either of those scenes.

Um, no, Lysa calls her a liar in the book too, for denying that she "seduced" Littlefinger.
4723	CaptainTheo	2014-05-13	Really, where is it written that that's a wedding ring? It could just be any old ring.


I always assumed it was a wedding ring because she never wore it until after the ceremony and always has after that, except in the scene the next morning when Shae finds her sheets clean.
4724	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-13	i know this is episode 7 discussion but episode 8 synopsis is out and uhmmm "Littlefinger's motives are questioned."
Â 
Thought Sansa would sit outside of episode 8, but..i guess not.
Â 
And how much of Sansa's material are they speeding through? if she is in episodeÂ 8 AND 10...that is a lot of material to use and she only has 3 chapters left after only cat. Unless it will all be filler material.

For those who don't have time to read the entire thread, can you tell us who won the argument?


There wasn't really a winner. There's a lot back and forth on, considering TV/movies do have a precedent of showing kisses between underage actresses and older actors.
Â 
Personally, considering everything that is on this show, I wouldn't be surprised if they kept the kiss; but also, I wouldn't be surprised if they maybe made it into Petyr just leaning in for a kiss or kissing her on the cheek (so not as ~scandalous~ as a full-on kiss, but enough to push Lysa over the top.)Â 
One of the arguments against a full kiss is that Aiden GIllen said Petyr was more "paternal/avuncular" this season with Sansa, but, considering how Petyr's been acting around Sansa, I think he was just messing with us.Â
4729	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-13	Reluctant at first about having Only Cat this episode, but it could work if they build it up enough (aka the last third of the episode taking place there at least). Then most probably we wont see the Eyrie again until episode 10.
Â 


Â 
Â 
The Eyrie is in episode 8 as well. HBO just released the description for that episode (i.e. "Litterfinger's motives are questioned").

The show has to date had a lot of trouble communicating Sansa's thought processes, so I really hope they've got a way to make this work.

4737	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-14	Â 
I guess this means we'll see the Lords Declarant in episode 8?
Have we had: "I need to know who's side your really on" yet? That seems pretty post-Lysa to me and I dont recall it from earlier. 
I also think we might get Lysa repeating her comments from the first Vale episode about the murder of Jon Arryn and whatnot.
4738	Sun	2014-05-14	We need to discuss Sansa's agency here.Â 


Â
4739	MercyTheBlindUglyLittleCat	2014-05-14	I had well before the season started assumed Only Cat would be in episode 7 or 8. Then a lot of people started to convince me that it would be in 10 due to the use of it to set up a first look at Stoneheart. Weird how things flip around, cause that preview definitely makes it seem likely that this is it. With Lysa revealing her role in the big conspiracy in episode 5, I guess its for the best not to drag things out, especially if this episode is as heavy on LF and Sansa as it seems in the preview.
4740	LaughingTreeMaiden	2014-05-14	So has anyone else wondered if they might change "Only Cat" to "Only Catelyn"?
Â 
A minor thing, but it crossed my mind.


Â 
I think they will. Harder to keep track of rarely-used nicknames on the show. I'm also sad that Daenerys was only called Dany once on the show (by Viserys, before he got his golden crown) because the only other person who'd think of her as Dany is herself, and there are no POVs on TV.
Â 
Losing their childhood nicknames has distanced Dany and Cat from the TV audience IMHO. Khaleesi is just becoming more aloof and bombastic with each new royal title.
4741	TheButcherCrow	2014-05-14	Think about it this way, the show has become infamous for it's episode nines. People (unsullied) are now expecting something mad to happen in ep 9. Â By killing Lysa in ep 7, they can then kill Oberyn in ep 8 (the "Ned Stark" moment of the season for the unsullied) Ygritte can die in ep 9 & Tywin in ep 10. Â This way they have a major(ish) death in each of the last four episodes & non-readers are gonna be blown away.
4742	TheButcherCrow	2014-05-14	you guys think that Littlefinger will kiss Sansa?
Â 
Might be a bit weird for Aiden Gillen (46) kissing Sansa (17 at the time)


Aiden Gillen once rimmed a 15yr old dude on a show called Queer as Folk, I think he's good.

Â 
They could still have Petyr say "Only Cat", if they let Lysa mention that nickname earlier in the scene, for example if she says the following quote from the book:
"You enticed him, just as your mother did that night in Riverrun, with her smiles and her dancing. You think I could forget? That was the night I stole up to his bed to give him comfort. I bled, but it was the sweetest hurt. He told me he loved me then, but he called meÂ Cat, just before he fell back to sleep."

It would be great, wouldn't it?

Well we got parts of it when she's talking to LF in 4x05 (that really bad exposition moment), so I'm wondering how much of it they'll reiterate, if any? Shouldn't Sansa overhear it?

Â 
We're missing:
Â 
"Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who hurt the ones we love?" (Mockingbird ep.)
"First time I saw you you were just a child. Girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. You're not a child anymore." (Uh...Mockingbird ep?)
"Who's side are you on?" (Maybe ep 8?)
"Some deaths are justified." (8?)
-The Lords Declarant (8?)
-Sansa walking away angry (8....or maybe 10?)

4763	juanml82	2014-05-14	Umm, why?
I understood this is not her first kissing on set, so why should it be hard to film? Kissing your colleague is part of the job description for an actor.
Aren't you maybe projecting your emotions about Baelish on the the actor Gillen and aren't you presuming prematurely that Sansa can find Baelish nothing but disgusting? Cooking a soup of dislike for Baelish with Sansa's alleged feelings and Turner's alleged dislike of Gillen? They are actors who act, remember! They do their job and will certainly have brushed their teeth. Though it could be the other way round: Gillen dislikes kissing Turner since he gets a sore neck from stretching it and has to stand on tiptoe all the time 


LOL
Â 


Personally I think Sansa should warg a dragon and fly around Westeros for the next three seasons screaming "LEMONCAKES!!!".

4765	relish5k	2014-05-14	I can't imagine they'll have Littlefinger blame some random guard we've never met before. I anything I think they'll just have her appear notably drunk and then Littlefinger will say she stumbled or something like that.


Â 
The benefit to having Littlefinger blame a random guard is that Sansa would need to be complicit in the coverup/framing of an innocent man. This would be a good plot device to develop her as a game player.
Â 
Another way I think they'll do that is by waiting until S5 to show that Littlefinger is poisoning Sweet Robin. At first, she be appalled (especially since they'll show how much SR cares for Sansa after the death of his mother), but then LF will show her that it's the only way for both the Vale, and for her own purposes as well.
Â 
But that's getting ahead...
4766	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-05-14	Honestly I wish they had introduced Marillion. Â He deserved what he got for trying to rape Sansa. Â

It certainly didn't "have" to be now.Â  They cut stuff from the middle of Sansa's journey to get to the Eyrie when they did, and even doing that, it really wouldn't have been hard to create a few scenes there (like Sansa interacting with Robin).

In the show agency Sansa will deliver with full agency a jump spinning heel kick to send batshit-agency Lysa careening out the moon door, and omni-agency Littlefinger runs up with incredible urgency so he can cup his hands to his mouth and yell out the door, using all his agency, as she nearly hits the ground, "ONLY AGENCY CAT! BY THE WAY!!"

That scene would make me very uncomfortable and drive me to comfort food. Â It would make me feel better if Littlefinger sings a song after that clarifies that he's not attracted to underage girls... just to be clear!

4776	boojam	2014-05-15	Memorial Day. Blackwater's ratings were really low because of it, so they take it off now, I believe.Yes that really got HBO's attention. It's odd , because the episode was very popular and word of mouth should have pumped further viewing that week, but we never really find out what the final numbers where. There seems to be no way to correct the plots of the number of views of S2E9, the dip there I just don't believe.But the Memorial Day jump seems set in stone now.
4777	boojam	2014-05-15	I don't like it being in episode 7 it would've been a perfect transition from only cat to LS but oh well.Yeah Kate Dickie is a fine actress and has done a fine job as Lysa Tully. Apparently she shot during filming of season 3 and was back again for filming season 4. So I guess some of footage will never be seen. I too expected the scenes with Dickie and the Eyrie to go at least one more episode.Too many good actors go away too fast.
4778	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-15	The complaints of too early... Srsly? 
People are actually complaining that the show is going to do a scene from the book (Instead of "fan fiction" scenes) and people still find something to whinge about. Jesus wept. 
Anyway... Personally cannot wait for Only Cat. One of my favourite scenes in the novels.

Â 
i agree, not every dramatic moment should be left for 9th/10th ep...people have come to expect that, which is why this time they decided to do PW in ep 2, threw all the unsullied off...
Â 
for me Only Cat scene was one of the biggest HOLY SHIT moments in the books, so i'm preparing my unsullied friends by saying that since there's gona be a week off after this ep, makes sense they should have some awesome cliffhangerÂ  
Â 
my one concern is that they have shown so little of Lysa and the Vale that the scene will not have the sort ofÂ  Â  Â impact like we got in the books since both Only Cat + Jon Arryn reveal was together...fingers crossed thoughÂ

Â 
I agree with that. I think more of the complaints about it being so early is that Sansa has what? 3 chapters in AFFC? I'm surprised they'd want to rush this scene when they have very little left for the next season. As it is, we'll be meeting the Vale Lords now after this episode, so either Sansa doesn't get a good cliffhanger, or they give her the Harry the Heir cliffhanger from AFFC and then we're done with her written material.

Yeah, I could see that. But I'm guessing we're going to be getting a good 15-20 minutes at the Vale towards the end of the episode (they haven't been cutting away from scenes as rapidly as they used to), so the feeling of dread will probably mount. And depending on how dark they portray LF, I think it could be effective. Everyone would be like "oh shit! he's the puppet master!" At least, that was my reaction.

Â 
I see what you're saying, but all what we're missing from the vale are lush green hillsides, Stone, Snow and Sky, and Littlefingers ancestral home.. I would have loved to see the previous scenes shot at that Baelish tower, because of how it would showcase Littlefingers poor background, and of course I'd loved to see the ascend of the Giant's Lance.. But I feel that we will see more of the Vale afterwards when the Lords Declarant appear..
Â 
However, with how the Gates of the Moon aren't really in this show and how the Bloody Gate has been set up as being the only way to the Eyrie, I wonder how that siege will end up looking, if it even ends up in the show..
Â 
I'm loving season 4, it really makes those scenes from the end of Swords pop.

Â 
im wondering next season focus will be much more on LF dealing with the lords of the vale and sansa more just in the background or some of those scenes with her sweet robin...D&D decided to really slow down the pace this yr, i rmr last season they were discussing how S4 would be a mix of book 3 and 4...but especially KL and Arya and the Wall are all still book 3 stuff...if they decide to continue giving GRRM more time, we may get the Harry the Heir cliffhanger towards the end of S5...
Â 
or maybe they'll decide to give up on GRRM and his false promises and just do their own thing...
Â 
last few eps, they have been devoting 20mins or so for the big "oh shit!" moments....i didnt think they wud do the same for this, in the books was so sudden, at least to me it felt like it came out of nowhere...but i could see them doing it well, starting off with LF/Sansa kiss, then Lysa summons, then some of that madness where she almost throws Sansa through the moon doors, then LF comes in, calms her down a bit, then boom and him smiling at sansa...can be done in 15-20mins...
Â 
i wonder if some of the unsullied will think LF did it to "protect" sansa from further abuseÂ

Nobody really thought otherwise for those plots.Â  KL and Wall, especially, were clearly intended as season-long arcs.Â  Some people thought Arya would have to go to Braavos by now, but I never did.Â  Conversely, Dany, Brienne, Bran, Theon, and Sansa are all entering AFFC/ADWD territory.

exactly...i wonder if they will follow some of GRRM's approach for the AFFC and just show a lot of Dorne the first ep of S5
4787	TheImpThatRides	2014-05-15	LF goes in for the tongue, Sansa gives him the cheek maybe?  Lysa doesn't need a whole lot to set her off.
4788	doghouse	2014-05-15	After reading this thread, I hope it is the nastiest, sloppiest, tonguiest kiss in television history. Littlefinger is a scumball. He has to make a pass at Sansa. People hoping he just touches her shoulder are really prude and shouldn't be watching Game of Thrones. The only thing that would be better is if they have WInger's "Seventeen" playing in the background.
4789	OnlyOne	2014-05-15	I think Sansa is going to get a hell of a lot smarter as soon as she kills LF.

4798	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-15	It looks like we're going to spend a fair bit of time at the Eyrie this episode - so why can't Marillion be Marillion?
Â 
So what if we haven't seen Marillion yet? Â How long does it take to set Marillion up? Â Not bloody long. Â Takes 2-3 minutes to show him hitting on Sansa in a creepy way and LF saving her - not only does the scene set him up, and do double duty by foreshadowing LF's later rescue, but it does triple duty because it emphasizes just howÂ very very much Sansa has to go through, constantly - it never ends! Â What a human pinata she is! Â 
Â 
Drop in another line or two about how much Lysa loves him, maybe a line where he flirts with her, and that's all you really need. Â He's just a singer, he isn't really expected to interact with the nobles, he can be sitting around singing while Lysa & Sansa are doing their little dance around the Moon Door. Â

4802	Nick_Scryer	2014-05-15	The fact that Marillion got his tongue cut out is all the more reason as to why he should appear in this episode, he won't be able to protest the accusations.

They could easily throw in a line for Lysa saying he was her favourite singer until Joffrey cut off his tongue and that she felt bad enough for him to keep him around or something.

Because of that promo pic with Brienne and Pod in gloomy forest.

I completely agree with you. Finale ending is the only way here, personally I don't think there was bigger plot twist than that in the books and to waste it on hiatus cliffhanger would be a mistake.

Agree. Also thinking that it will be the "second ending" so to speak. Imo we will get "Wherever whores go." *twang* cue rains of castamere (its inevitable *sigh*) and fade to black. Fade back in to however they plan the LS reveal. If its from Brienne's PoV, I imagine it as her waking up/regaining conciousness. Quick dialogue with Thoros and then the LS reveal (with a Frey dangling in the background). Cut to black. Fin.

The show loves this 'fade to black-cut to quick shocking scene' move - it worked well in s1 and s2. When s3 ended without a shock for the audience, from what I recall there was quite a backlash, because it was underwhelming. I'm not a big fan of Brienne being there when LS is revealed to the audiance but they accelerated up her journey this season so it's probably heading this way.
4814	igrewupinKL	2014-05-16	okay, so there's a 2 week break after this episode?
Â 
That makes me think something big is happening at the end of this episode, obvioulsy 'only cat' but i'm wondering whether lady stoneheart will appear...i don't think it'll be that bad...
because if they reveal her now they can have brienne meet her in ep 10. we know she bites someone's ear off this season...hmmm i don't know with everything that will go on in ep 10 it may be better to do it now
4815	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-16	^The two-week break is for the Memorial Day (US fellows will confirm), to avoid lower ratings.
Honestly the LS reveal is going to be so huge that I doubt they would drop it anywhere else than last episode/scene. Having it in ep7 would be anti-climatic, though I do think we'llÂ get hints (hanged people for instance).

Â 
Precisely. What is huge thing is not that Brienne runs into LS - it's LS. That's a big shock. If LS is revealed now and Unsullied see Brienne on the road, given her oath to Cat I doubt they'd be shocked seeing them running into each other.
Â 
Only Cat is good enough of hiatus cliffhanger, especially if the sequence follows 'as your champion' immediately.
4817	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-16	I think Pod and Brienne will start finding hanged men... They take a closer look... twin Towers sewn on their jackets. 
This will continue until episode 10 when either: 
We meet Merret Frey for the last 5 mins. 
Or 
Brienne is brought before her. 
Hopefully the former. I fucking love that epilogue. 
When I first read it, I was like "YEAH!!!!" Fist pump!!!!

Â 
Because D&D sure loooove their House Lannister and Dany and will more likely end with one of them, sadly. So I wouldn't count on LS being the season-cliffhanger. I hope you're right though and I really hope I'm wrong. Nice Paulie pic by the way.

4820	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-16	I think it would be a good idea to have some hint of her being around, (stories of freys disappearing, hanged freys) leading up to the big reveal.

That's exactly why I think Brienne can't be brought to Stoneheart this season. Putting the Merrett scene at the end of ASOS was one of GRRM's best moves. D&D would be fools to change that. We need that fist pump moment. We need to believe for quite a while and only then to wonder what the hell happened when all goes to hell.

Â 
Wonder...about what? I'm not sure why so many people thought the epilogue was...uplifting? It's quite clear LS is hateful and cold, not just towards Freys but she generally became this way in the epilogue. She is described as horrifying creature, I know it's Freys' POV but her appearance alone should be a hint towards the state of her soul.
4825	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-16	Also, if Brienne is put with LS now we could end up in Winds material for her next season...
4826	Mark Antony	2014-05-16	Also, if Brienne is put with LS now we could end up in Winds material for her next season...
Well we would still have to get Jaime to the riverlands right? I must say the outcome of the Jaime/Brienne/LS situation would be a spoiler that I would not want to see before I read!

It seems like it's going to be the case with Sansa in s5, I see no reason why they can't go further here as well, especially with how little we know of LS - the show can expand on that story arc.
Â 
I'd rather have epilogue filmed as it was but seeing where things are going this season with Brienne it looks to me they unfortunately merged the scenes.

I think it's a common tactic in the books for things to seem black and white at first.Â  Jaime certainly doesn't seem 3 dimensional when we meet him.Â  I felt that way about LS.Â  While her condition is messed up and she's obviously fueled by vengeance and hate, it was a sort of consolation that something, anything, would be bringing the Freys to justice.Â  Then Brienne meets her and it's just like "ugh, damn you, George!"

Definitely a consolation with Freys getting killed but for me that epilogue was seriously horrific.Â  To be fair though, Brienne has pretty damning evidence all around her, but yeah it was a bit of a shock to see Cat being THIS cold.

As Mark said though, Jamie is not yet in the Riverlands. That could lead to some confusion on how to get Jamie and Brienne to meet without having Brienne directed back to King's Landing...
I have accepted they will touch on the Winds content of some characters next season (Bran and Sansa most likely) but Brienne's just doesn't seem to fit with the other timelines

What I meant is yes, Lady Stoneheart is dark and cold and terrible, but she's definitely vengeance, and at first that seems like a good thing. I mean she's killing Freys! You gotta be cheering. So when you read it you feel like the story has just taken a pretty dark turn, but it's all for the best.
That illusion was great, because then when she hanged Brienne, I had ANOTHER WTF moment when i realized my mistake. And two gotta be better than one.

Anyway... Personally cannot wait for Only Cat. One of my favourite scenes in the novels.


Â 
I totally agree. It's weird that people are looking for the show to remedy what they didn't like or would like happening to their charactersâ<U+0080>¦ as if that would somehow actually mean something for the books (i.e. Sansa warging/skin changing, no creepiness btwn her and LF). Really, no matter what happens in the series, the story won't change. It is the books that influence the series, not he other way around.Â
4833	hallam	2014-05-16	So if LF only loved Cat, when is he going to be getting it together with Lady Stoneheart then?
Â 
I don't see why Marillion would not have left Kings Landing after Joffrey had his tongue cut out. Getting away as fast as he could would make most sense.
Â 
Returning to the Erie to get a job with his old employer would make perfect sense. He can still play. He has had plenty of time it was season 1 since we saw him last. LF might have brought him with him for all we know.
4834	Colonel Green	2014-05-16	Returning to the Erie to get a job with his old employer would make perfect sense.


He was never employed at the Eyrie.
4835	Joseph Nobles	2014-05-16	Â 
Posted by Tquinn BC: Guys, Lady Stoneheart will obviously happen in episode 10 (a supernatural ending filled with major shock and revenge, it will match all the other final endings) Why does anyone think it will happen sooner?
Â 
I think I've found a pattern in the closing image for the season. Season one was Dany stepping out of the ashes with her dragons - an image of Fire. Then Season Two, the advance of the Others on the Fist of the First Men - an image of Ice. And then Three, Dany triumphant - Fire again. If this holds true, then we will see an expression of the power of Ice at the very end of Four. And UnCat is the work of R'hllor, the god of Flames. So I don't think UnCat will be the final image of this season.
Â 
One problem for me is that we've already seen a good candidate forÂ an IceÂ scene - the delivery of Craster's final child to the head Other/Night's King/whomever. But I posit that after the binding of the dragons, we will see a second version of that scene - a Walker showing up to the ice henge without a child. The head ice demon then calls up his army (complete with ice spiders????) and heads South. Winter is on the march.
ETA: Fixed a mistaken reference.

But it's too similar to Season 2's ending. Then again, with the White Walkers taking their time, there aren't many novelties regarding "ice magic"
4837	Nuncle Kraken	2014-05-17	Hopefully the final scene will be Bloodraven on his Weirwood throne.

That's actually a pretty common theory around the internet. However, I think it's a bit of stretch. Sure, seasons 1 & 2 were like that, but calling Season 3's ending "fire" is a bit of a stretch. Also, the showrunners don't want to be predictable- they'll probably just chose the best moment to end the season with, and not follow some sort of pattern. This season, it's almost definitely LS (which I personally was never captivated by :/).
4839	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-17	Showing the white walkers launching an attack in a frozen wasteland is an image of 'fire'?
4840	xandi	2014-05-17	Showing the white walkers launching an attack in a frozen wasteland is an image of 'fire'? 


Â 
I believe it was a typo in the post you are referring to; obviously, white walkers attacking is an image of "Ice". However, I don't think the show would deliberately impose upon itself such rigid patterns (alternating fire and ice closing shots). I think the camera closing on LS, with hopefully some high-quality horrific makeup would be an excellent ending shot for the season.

4841	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-17	If we do close with "Ice" the only logical scene is Bran and Bloodraven. If theu make him suitably creepy...and keep the Other attack outside the cave...could work I guess.
ETA: Or even a contrast between Bloodraven and Lady Stoneheart. Cut from.Bran reaching him to Merret/Brienne and Pod reaching her or vice versa

You think that the show runners are basing their decisions what to make the last shot of the season on symbolism that 90% of viewers wouldn't even get (not to mention that the show isn't preoccupied with symbolism and that the Unsullied are likely to know about ice and fire just if they know the title of the series it's based on), rather than on what makes for best TV? Really?
4843	sati	2014-05-17	But Mhysa didn't even necessarily end with fire, at least s1 the birth of the dragons was the direct result of pyre. I suppose if Dany is fire, Starks are ice, voila, Lady Stark.
Â 
But I don't think that 'pattern' was in any way confirmed so it's not a binding thing.

You're right. Most people who watch the show genuinely believe that the name of the books as a whole is GoT and when told how it is titled Â asoiaf they proceed to explain how that is just a convoluted name to make it more mysterious for book nerds but that HBO has the right of itâ<U+0080>¦.Â

Trivial superiority is an important thing, dontcha know?
Â 
Also, I can't imagine D&D thinking "well, we were gonna have LS as the closing scene, since it's clearly the best choice, but it doesn't fit with some accidental quasi-symbolism pattern of the past few seasons soooo... gonna have to do something else instead". Just seems far-fetched.
4847	Chebyshov	2014-05-17	It will be LS. It's a major supernatural event, which is on par with the content of Season 1 & 2's endings. As someone pointed out, S3 didn't close with ice or fire, though admittedly they kind of whiffed on that episode.
4848	Joseph Nobles	2014-05-17	Personally I don't see anything about the ending of Season Three that could be defined as "a major supernatural event." Dany was greeted by the slaves of Astapor as a liberator. That was the ending. I can see that as a symbol of the ascending power of Fire, though. And so I will continue to expect a similar depiction of the power of Ice at the end of this season.
And if it doesn't happen, I expect I'll get over it.

They tease me in the same way for being a book nerd and always having my kindle on me, even to go to the supermarket.Â

It's the exact opposite for me  . All the friends I have are constantly going on about GRRM being a genius, awesome, "his TV show" being the greatest ever, etc. However, none of them are even aware of D&D, etc. I respect Martin a lot, and am really happy that he's getting all this publicity for this amazing story. However, I feel that D&D, Cogman, etc should also get some credit for the excellent job they've done in adapting the source material so brilliantly, but, imo, they barely get any credit.

No one is required to know or do anything. But generally speaking when you are an actual fan, not just a causal admirer, of someone's work you tend to know whose work you are admiring.Â 
Â 
You wouldn't take someone to refers to the Mona Lisa as "that painting in that big museum, with the weird smile going on, by that famous painter with a long beard" to be a huge fan of that painting. Same in sports, if you are a fan of the team you don't usually refer to them as the team with the fans who wear white (heats), the team with the star as their symbol (cowboys), and you usually know their main players names. Would you consider someone who does not know who Peyton Manning, or even better John Fox (the head coach) is diehard Bronco's fan?

Or in my case, I love the LOTR films, but I've never read the books. I tried but Tolkien's way of writing bores me to death.

Personally I would give people a shot of ice spiders. The higher ice demon things riding them would be even better. It could happen like I said above, in the context of there being no more Craster sons to turn, or it could happen right outside Bloodraven's cave. Bran and company escape from White Walkers and zombies into the cave, they go down and find the reality behind the three-eyed crow they have been tracking down for three seasons, and then outside, up ride the Night's King and companions on their ice spiders. It probably wouldn't go down just like that - the scenes would be spaced out over the episode. Cutting from Dany leaving the white and green dragons behind in their pen to the Night's King riding up at the cave would be how I'd write it. But then again, D&D don't ask me my opinion on these things. So you never know until the day of the show!

I'd love if a heavier version of the Stark theme (Winter is Coming) was played as she builds the castle. Then, with Littlefinger showing up, we could get some exposition on her longing and missing for Winterfell. Not long and strong visuals.

I really do hope they pull it off, I will forgive a lot of issues I've had with the show if they pull it off. It's one of my top 5 favorite scenes from the entire series.
Â 
Of course given their track record of what they've done with my other favorite scenes I'm ambivalent about their chances of success.
Â 
My other top 5 scenes:
Â 
"The King in the North": they did okay, but not as epic as it was in the books, but I give them a passing grade.
Â 
"Sharp": Â Completely botched this one and the entire Halfhand character.
Â 
"I only rescue maidens": a failing grade because Jaime didn't get to say any of his lines.
Â 
"Elia!' Â We'll see about this one too

Or do it like they did Brans dreams in Season 1, have her close her eyes after building it and you see a few scenes of her and her family together from season 1 until LF appears and ruins the moment.
4870	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-18	They can actually have her speaking in this scenen. Sophie could probably get the emotion across on her face when she is alone, then when Petyr starts helping she says a few more lines - memories about WF, rather than just what she needs help building

Iirc in the books she tells LF what WF looks like and how she is struggling to build a cwrtain part, but she has more personal memories like Arya and Bran pelting her with snowballs and her cathing Arya while Bran climbed out of the way... she can easily vocalise this memory

More than just losing Crasters babies, the wildlings uniting and marching south deprives them of their resources. Crasters might have just been the last straw.
And they can have Sansa talking to Robin, and Robin not really getting it. That makes it even more shocking when he wrecks it.

4879	SixPence	2014-05-18	Best way to reveal unCat and Tywin would be to do them both in the last episode, at the end. Those would make for some epic cliffhangers. Episode 9 ending with Varys freeing Tyrion from the prison, and showing him the way to the tunnels. Then it would cut as though he had then escaped, no more KL for episode 10, mainly focusing on the wildling attack. Â Then at the end there's the Stannis-to-the-rescue scene, before it cuts to the scene where unCat has the Frey hung, and she doesn't turn and show her identity until just before the end credits.
Â 
End credits roll, then afterwards there will be a short sequence with Tyrion and Tywin on the shitter, and... cut season.

4883	Kaspiro	2014-05-18	"Only Cat" will happen this episode, if I had to guess. The finale already seems to have a lot planned, with Tyrion/Tywin and Lady Stoneheart.Â
4884	sati	2014-05-18	Do we think they may give any indication that Oberyn had something to do with Tywin's death?


I hope so. They did have that scene with Tywin eating, they can just mention later - 'Oberyn had access to Tywin's food when they were judges' or something like that.
4885	Rashtibram	2014-05-18	I don't think any montages/flashbacks/long, heartfelt emotional speeches are coming our way, guys. Most likely scenario is we cut from Sansa starting to build the castle to LF walking in and asking her whether or not it's Winterfell. I know many of us are hoping for something more emotional, but the kind of scene this is in the books would be very difficult to convey in the manner the show is used to, and I wouldn't be surprised if it left a lot of Sansa fans disappointed.
4886	Arkash	2014-05-18	At least we got it, and I'm glad we got it. The visuals alone will be great !
4887	Lyanna_Lou	2014-05-18	Well that was quite the cut scene. I bet a lot of the Unsullied will be agog at it.
4888	-Ghost-	2014-05-18	WHY DID THEY CHANGE IT!!??
4889	marsyao	2014-05-18	I feel a little let down about the moon door scene, they should let Lysa tells us what happenes between littlefinger and her, forced abortion of her child, forced to marry to an old man she did not love etc. that would be much more powerful, now in front of us is just a crazy jealous woman and nothing more
4890	Howdyphillip	2014-05-18	WHY DID THEY CHANGE IT!!??


Â 
I don't know... I am going to guess because the way they filmed it made for absolutely fantastic television, while the way it was written would have come out looking garbled on film. I do not think that a long monologue would have looked anything but contrite to the viewers. It just isn't essential to the story.
Â 
Â If you want to know the behind the scenes... I suggest reading the books.
Â 
This is incredible television. Â

I dont know what youre going on about, but Im talking about changing only Cat to your sister. Lysa has gone on and on about how Cat never deserved LFand treated him like shit. The Unsullied would know who the Cat was that he was talking about. No need to change that.
4898	DarkerStar	2014-05-18	Only your sister, Only Cat. It would have been so easy. I know they don't make the show for us book readers but I wish they had given us that

No worries ... I was referring to the people upset that there was not a big monologue revelation with Lysa at the end... I am completely ambivalent about that particular line being changed. Â

The directing was beautiful in this sequence! Though it was not a slo-mo death, so it sadly that could still be Oberyn. Yuck. 
Two things that stood out about this scene though: 
1) Sansa didn't overhear about Lysa poisoning Jon, and 
2) no giant for Sansa to rip up, which means that the doll likely wasn't the giant in the prophesy (if there was any doubt)

This was so good I'm not even mad as i fall past Sky and Stone.
4905	pntrlqst	2014-05-18	My guess is "Only Cat" will be said in the finale, in some other context.

2) no giant for Sansa to rip up, which means that the doll likely wasn't the giant in the prophesy (if there was any doubt)


I think Lysa yelling about have murdered for him is meant to substitute for that (basically, they want Sansa to put it together later, rather than have her hear explicitly about the poisoning and then explain why she doesn't do anything with it).
Â 
As to the latter, I don't think that means anything, since the Ghost of High Heart's prophecy wasn't in the show to begin with.

I liked the snow castle scene...very beautiful and Sansa acted like mature lady. I did love the slap! Slow-mo is for Ygritte I think, I saw many horrors but I think Oberyn in slow mo would legit make me vomit.
4908	Darth Pipes	2014-05-18	I wasn't bothered by the Only Cat line being changed.Â  I don't know why they changed it but I thought everything was done perfectly.Â  So it wasn't a big deal to me.

Â 
yes, it's a pity that sansa didn't over hear the confession but what stood out for me was littlefinger telling sansa to destroy those that hurt the people she loves will come back to bite him when she eventually finds out his role in her family's demise. that is just a good student following instructions.
Â 
as for the prophesy, since none of that is being used in the show, i doubt we can rule it out. in fact, it is sweet robin that destroys the castle in the book and in the show so perhaps it's foreshadowing that he will be a deterrent to her returning/rebuilding her home.

For me the most notable change in tonight's episode wasn't "Only Cat" it was from "Is it your fault that Bronn's an insolent black-hearted rogue? that's why I always like him" to "your an evil bastard that's why I always liked you". D & D just don't have an ear for poetry the way GRRM does...kinda irks me

4917	Stannis-the-Mannis	2014-05-18	D&D blew it on that scene. everyone watching knew what LF was about to do, just like everyone knew when we were reading the books. What made it such a great scene was what Lysa said Â before she flew, which was some truly mind-blowing shit. Shortening it was a brutal move.
Â 
Also having Lysa scream in extreme closeup was cringe worthy. IIRC she doesn't make a sound in the books, hearing "Only Cat" had that powerful of an effect on her.

4924	Hoo	2014-05-18	I thought "your sister" was a more powerful line. It resonates better.
And two, it was more consistent with the relational theme of the show, Arya and Hound talking about brothers, Oberyin and Tyron.

4929	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-18	I hated how they changed "Only Cat" to "Your sister." Just awful. Yet another example of them trying to "fix" or "improve" something that doesn't actually need improving. The rest of the scene was mostly well-done, though.On the other hand, Pedro Pascal pretty much stole the whole episode in his one scene. He's just nailed Oberyn Martell since the moment he first appeared on screen. The biggest crime is they haven't used him nearly enough.
4930	karna1983	2014-05-18	Great episode. Not fussed about the Cat line. But I wanted Lysa to mention the abortion, marrying someone 3 times her age and maybe killing Jon.
Â 
But without Marillion, who is going to get the blame. Hopefully not Mord. It would be too unrealistic blaming someone so dumb. The singer was a creepy shit and all the Vale Lords hated him and it was believeable. /

So including that again would have been redundant.

4934	dtones520	2014-05-18	i don't think it's a big dealthey changed it. "your sister" and "only cat" are saying the same thing.

No kidding. The only reason "Only Cat" is a memorable line is because it happened right before Littlefinger pushed Lysa out the moon door. Saying "your sister" was Littlefinger conveying the same message to Lysa, the scene was powerful the way they did it and it accomplished the same thing the book accomplished. What's the problem?
George could have wrote "Poop" before Littlefinger pushed Lysa out and I bet it would hold the same reverence with some book readers as "Only Cat" because it was a shocking, memorable moment and it was the last thing people read before that shocker.
4935	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-18	I think "your sister" makes more for the wider show audience. There are way more lines from the books that I'd rather see, to be honest, and other things from that scene, like Marillion

And this
4936	Hotpie the Destroyer	2014-05-18	So I was skimming through some of neoGAF's "Mocking Bird" thread and they were going nuts over the whole line change.(have yet to see the scene) All over "Only Your Sister" used instead.  Most people were angry because they thought DnD were insulting the viewer by basically saying they wouldn't remember who cat was (non book walkers), and would be confused....like thinking LF was refering to...ser pounce...Their argument was that "Cat" wasn't mentioned in the show at all so DnD changed it for the viewer...but I can literally remember at least two instances "Cat" was used to refer to Catelyn.  Once when Tyrion is setting up the three way deception in KL when he first became Hand(season 2 episode 3).  Speaking to LF "How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"  Another instance is when Cat is in Renly's camp, and LF came to offer peace tefms with Cat with Neds bones.  When he go to grab her arm and she whips the dagger out.  "Cat I...."  anyway I was screaming at my screen in them basically condemning themselves with their own logic not even remembering themselves..that Cat has been used numerous times to refer to Catelyn.
4937	Winterfell is Burning	2014-05-18	A lot of people would have no idea who "Cat" was. It's sad, but it's true.
4938	dtones520	2014-05-18	Well, we did get Lysa mentioning poisoning Jon Arryn a few episodes ago. So including that again would have been redundant.

She essentially admitted to killing Jon in front of Sansa. She raved about how people die when they stand between her and Petyr. And even if she doesn't know, it doesn't seem like a big deal. What did her knowing really effect Sansas story in the book? I can't remember it effecting anything she did from that point on.
And I feel like they are moving fast through a lot if material for a reason, I hope that reason is because they know they are going to have quite a few new storylines next year with the Iron Islands stuff and the Martell stuff from AFFC/ADWD. They have definitely set up Dorne as a major player and have introduced the Sand Snakes briefly. They also have Yara accepting that Theon is lost and that she is Balons only true heir from the scene last week.
4939	dtones520	2014-05-19	A lot of people would have no idea who "Cat" was. It's sad, but it's true.

Why is it sad? There are so many characters on this show for people to keep track of and even though Cat was a major character, most people knew her as Lady Stark not her nickname that was rarely uttered on the show. Especially when her name has hardly been said since episode 9 of last season a year ago. Is really not that sad for most viewers who watch the episode once or twice and don't spend hours rewatching and posting on message boards discussing everything they saw. It's actually quite understandable.

I can't remember it effecting anything she did from that point on.I don't think GRRM would have had Sansa witness Lysa admitting to being convinced by LF to kill the Hand of the King if it wasn't going to be used a later point. It hasn't really been used in the story as of the end of ADWD. It doesn't mean it won't be used later, however.Moving it to an earlier episode made sense due to not necessarily having enough time to do all of that in one scene. But I do think something was lost by doing that. If it ends up being important to Sansa's arc, they could always just find a way to have her find out at a later date and then use it however book Sansa hypothetically uses it.Â And I feel like they are moving fast through a lot if material for a reason, I hope that reason is because they know they are going to have quite a few new storylines next year with the Iron Islands stuff and the Martell stuff from AFFC/ADWD.

Given all that, we probably won't be seeing Sansa much next season (like Bran and Theon this season).

Many are smart enough to connect the dots. LF had just admitted to only loving Cat in the previous scene after all. I guess they wanted to be absolutely certain there would be no confusion about who LF loved.

Eh people underestimate how bad viewers are with names. It's why the producers keep telling the story the pilot how the screeners had no idea Jamie and cersei were twins.


Â 
Exactly. Many casual viewers remember characters not as "Sansa", "Catelyn" and "Lysa", but as "ginger Stark", "Stark mom" and "Stark mom's sister / the crazy breastfeeding woman". Changing that line made sense from that perspective.
Â 


There is only one group of people that care about the change. Only book readers. *Pushes all of you out the moon door*

I don't know why some people are so obsessed with the "Only Cat" line. There's really nothing special about it. LF's line tonight was fine.


Â 
Agreed. He could have said anything in that scene and it still would have served the same purpose.
4944	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-19	I'm not going to lose sleep over the "Only Cat" line. I just thought the change in the episode was unnecessary and too heavy handed, especially after the scene they had right before it where Littlefinger went out of his way to explain that he only loved Cat. They even made sure that Sansa referred to Lysa as her aunt in the same scene. It's a matter of changing a simple yet affectionate line to a clunky and way too specific line.
4945	Hotpie the Destroyer	2014-05-19	I was internally raging at some neoGAFers saying people wouldnt remember.  They were claiming no one EVER called her "cat" in the show.  Cat has been refered to as "Cat" two times that I can remember.  Season 2 Tyrion to LF in the 3 way deception in KL. "How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?" And the next episode when LF tries to grab Cats arm in renly's camp.

Same!! They work so hard to make Cersei a sympathetic character you would think they would do the same for a character that has had such a horrible life. When I read the scene it didn't really feel triumphant, it made me deeply sad (and shocked obviously) on how mentally ill this character was. Alot of unsullied reactions have been 'fuck yeah bitch deserved it, baelish is my hero' which is understandable given they haven't given her the humanity she had in the books.Â
4948	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-19	I was internally raging at some neoGAFers saying people wouldnt remember. They were claiming no one EVER called her "cat" in the show. Cat has been refered to as "Cat" two times that I can remember. Season 2 Tyrion to LF in the 3 way deception in KL. "How would you like too see your beloved Cat again?" And the next episode when LF tries to grab Cats arm in renly's camp.Yeah, that's a ridiculous rationale on their part. She's been called Cat many times throughout the series. She was even referred to as Cat in this very episode. So, um, yeah.Â P.S. Daario = Euron By the Seven, why?!

4949	Hotpie the Destroyer	2014-05-19	There are some really compelling theories on it.  I even caught in season 3 when daario is cleaning his blade in the Second Suns camp figuring out who was going to slay Dany.  They took great, but subtle pains to get a minor slow close up of his dagger. Which is said to resemble Eurons Ship with naked lady and such.  Anyhow beyond that, there are many things backing the theory IMO.  I'll look for the list.

Agreed, it is out there, hence my winky face but, if it turns out to be true I won't be surprised.
4952	Hotpie the Destroyer	2014-05-19	To be honest, the reason I think Balon hasn't died yet, indicates to me that daairo will leave, and then.....Kingsmoot
4953	BurningCandle	2014-05-19	I found the scene so very satisfying. I was a little thrown off by the lack of "Only Cat", but I thought "your sister" worked just as well, and I thought show watchers might not immediately pick up on Cat. Saying "your sister" right after Sansa refers to her as "aunt" reinforces who Littlefinger is talking about. I'm sure unsullied would get there eventually but it was important they get their immediately.
Â 
And I don't feel the least bit sorry for Lysa. She had a hard hand dealt to her, the same as pretty much every single other woman in Westeros, but instead of making the best of it, she killed her husband, mislead her sister and her sister's family deliberately about the Lannisters (eventually leading to their deaths), held that farce of a trial full well KNOWING Tyrion was not guilty (of her husband's murder), and repeatedly threatened Sansa. What goes around comes around.
Â 
I certainly wouldn't cheer Baelish as a hero by any means, but that was just so perfect.

Also without the singer's presence it's going to be harder for LF to get away with the murder with the Lord's Declarant, isn't it?
I really liked the back and forth between Robyn & Sansa & Sansa & LF.
I agree with those who are upset with Lysa was being reduced " to that crazy lady" but she did help set into motion the murder of her sister's family and a war that's ruining much of the Kingdom.

Good point.
4958	Frey Pies	2014-05-19	Guys, what makes "only Cat" better than "only your sister"? I was honestly worried that they would have "only Catelyn Stark" or something to avoid confusion, but the way they handled it in the show was really satisfying for me.
4959	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-19	I was happy that the monologue was gone (seeing as how it was essentially moved to a prior episode anyway), so the scene ran smoothly. The omission of "Only Cat" really threw me at first, because I was anticipating it for so long and we got the tease of "only one person" just before; but honestly I'm fine with it. I think even Ser Pounce is more well known than the nickname Cat, so if they kept the original line in some Unsullied may have thought "Wait, he did all this for Ser Pounce?!".
Â 
Well not really, but I can see why they'd make the line a little more obvious. At least it was kept to two short words.
Â 
It will be interesting to see how LF handles the excuse of her death.
Â 


There is only one group of people that care about the change. Only book readers. *Pushes all of you out the moon door*

I was honestly worried that they would have "only Catelyn Stark" or something to avoid confusion, but the way they handled it in the show was really satisfying for me."Your sister" is needlessly descriptive, especially when they had just reminded viewers of his love for Cat and her relation to Lysa and Sansa in the previous scene. Calling her Cat is more personal/affectionate than "your sister." That's my problem with the change at least.

I really don't get what the writers are going for with Sansa's repeated querying of his motivations.Â  Structurally if comes across like what he says here should be the 'true' reason, but it can't be, on a logical level; what he said before was far closer to the truth.
4963	MercyTheBlindUglyLittleCat	2014-05-19	What a shame they felt they had to change the line to which the whole scene has been identified by us book readers. Not sure any justification will do. I mean, is it really that they thought the average unsullied wouldn't get "Cat" in the context of the scene?

Â 
You need to remember, Lysa isn't the sort of character that had alot of natural strength to begin with. She lived in someone's shadow her whole childhood and was by all means a meek, shy albeit sweet girl. She was overshadowed by Cat in beauty, personality, and capabilities. Her father, her uncle, petyr all love Cat more than her. She lost her mother at a young age. Falls madly in love with the boy who is madly in love with cat. Loses her virginity to this boy (a priceless thing for such a highborn girl, and pretty much nullifies her value once she's no longer a virgin), then as they are having sex he calls her 'cat'. After this encounter Petyr fights a duel for her sister's hand in marriage and loses. Lysa cares for him through even that because she loves him so much. She gets pregnant with his child. When her father finds out she forces her to drink moon tea, which makes her miscarry and have fertility problems for the rest of her life. Then as her political value has dropped immensely she is forcibly married AT THE AGE OF 15/16 to a 70 year old man. He is not mean to her but he isn't warm to her. She has many miscarriages and stillbirths, meaning she has failed as a woman, all while her sister has many heirs. And never underestimate how emotionally damaging stillbirths and miscarriages are. Imagine how lonely those years would have been for her, literally having no love around her, her sanity causing her to go from the sweet girl Cat remembers to the crazy Lysa we see. Then she has Robert, and naturally she is anÂ intensely clinging parent who continues to baby her son, literally all she has in the world to live for. Then her husband wants him fostered, which would leave her alone again. Simultaneously, this boy she loved proposed a plot to keep her son with her, and probably included some plan of them marrying when he died. So naturally, being obsessed with petyr and her son, she agreed. Fast forward, Petyr arrives at the Eyrie with mini-cat, causing Lysa's childhood jealousies to return. As she dies, the person she has loved with all her heart tells her that he only ever loved her sister. I think that hand is worse than most of Westeros, save woman subject to physical torture.Â

4965	DorneStorm80	2014-05-19	For those whining about and berating those who are whining about the "Your sister" revision: Tom Stoppard in his play The Real Inspector Hound exposes the hackery of some writers who haven't the creative resources to include expository information without simply announcing it in the most cringe-worthy and ridiculously obvious way. D and D apparently haven't come across Stoppard (their humorless interviews seem to confirm this). Let me see if I can explain why changing "Only Cat" might matter to some:
1. Baelish grew up with Catelyn and Lysa. They've shared quite a few life-altering experiences. Call me strange, but it just seems ridiculous that a middle-aged man would refer to his unrequited love to her freakin' sister as "your sister." Just as a generic plot/character device, well, refer back to Stoppard. Even given the possibility of cynically worrying that viewers--who have now had three seasons' worth of episodes to put on their memory caps--might not know who "Cat" is, maybe that's the consequence of trying to jam too much content into 50 minutes of space. Maybe if they would allow their scenes (and therefore characters) a little bit more space to breathe, they wouldn't feel compelled to make such inane editorial choices. 
Let me put it this way: the edit was so stupid that it made me pause and think about how stupid it was, thereby destroying the whole dramatic effect of the climax. Now that's what a hack edit will do.
2. I'd argue there's dramatic punch to "Cat"--a punch that is lost by "Your sister." By saying "Cat," Baelish is throwing the intimacy he has had with "your sister" right in Lysa's face. He's also implying more than just a fraternal intimacy. It's what makes Baelish such a nasty piece of work: he's not just sending her to a horrific death, he's sending her there with the knowledge that he loved "your sister" AND that he had long since earned the right to call her "Cat." It's twisting the knife before she even knew it was in her. Pity the producers didn't give us Lysa's revelation of hearing "that" word, but, the HBO clock of doom ("must not go beyond 50 minutes...") was clanging, so...see Stoppard and hackery explanation above.
Look, I'm not going to make the argument that Martin is The Bard, but he is damn clever with dialogue and shows nice depth of characterization. It makes for good writing, good enough to make this humble reader read a genre he wouldn't normally be caught dead glancing at. Is it too much to ask the producers and the bean-counters at HBO not to muck up the good bits? My Seven Gods, the fact that so many readers remember the line should be at least be a hint of the potency of it. 
And props to HouseHarrison and the link, which perfectly illustrates Stoppard's Theory of Expository Hackery

All they needed was to slip in the word "Catelyn" into Lysa's crazy rant against the Catelynsansa monster that was trying to steal her man.Â

And also, I think they goofed on the poisoning Jon Arryn reveal, because now we the viewers know that, but Sansa doesn't. All she said to Sansa was "I killed for you".

As far as changes go, I wouldn't say this was their worst decision to date but it was certainly a very questionable one.
4968	HouseHarrison	2014-05-19	Yeah, the Cat had significant in the story. He calls her Cat, because he still imagines her as the same little girl he grew up with at Riverrun.Â

The RW was done in Joff's name & to benefit the Lannisters but Baelish is  clearly just trying to bind Sansa to him.  But after pushing her aunt out the Moon Door she is going to be careful and wary of him, even if she plays along.

4971	Bear Island	2014-05-19	Two things that stood out about this scene though:
1) Sansa didn't overhear about Lysa poisoning Jon, and
2) no giant for Sansa to rip up, which means that the doll likely wasn't the giant in the prophesy (if there was any doubt)
Â 


Or, the doll and snow castle is all the prophecy referred to and it's unimportant so it wasn't included. It could go either way. I don't remember that prophecy being mentioned in the show.
I was glad they left in the kiss, and at first 'Your sister' surprised me. I know Unsullied have a bad reputation for forgetting character names but I think they were underestimated. It was still a very poignant moment.

There might be a few others that have been mentioned here and there that I'm forgetting. But most have been removed or severely reduced in significance. So this change probably doesn't mean anything as far as the books go.

4974	brown ben romney	2014-05-19	i know i shouldn't be mad about them changing only cat to your sister, but regardless i'm really really really mad about it. only cat just has such a nice ring to it. it was especially dissapointing after how awesome the rest of the episode was. all of tyrion's scenes were brilliant, especially him and oberyn's. i started flipping shit when oberyn started talking about his trip to casterly rock because i thought they might cut that scene. the reintroduction of the mountain was great, and then the reappareance of hot pie. HOT PIE! Â and i liked the scene's at the wall as well. and the scenes at the eyrie started off so well too...
Â 
...and then everything was ruined...by "your sister."

IT'S "ONLY CAT."Â Â

I really like the fact that they ignore people that have read the books and their emotional attachments to them.
Â 
That OCD driven "need" to match the book with the TV show is annoying. "Oh no, what I expected didn't happen exactly as I had expected it! The horror!"
Â 
It's a TV show. If I want to read the books, I'll read the books.Â

4976	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-05-19	I just feel like if they had to change the quote the way they did, the moon door scene should have been right before Oberyn and Tyrion. Let the episode end on a high note.
4977	Son of An Other	2014-05-19	Robert used her nickname in the very 1st episode right when he arrived at Winterfell IIRC.
4978	Envie	2014-05-19	I guess I really don't get the whole obsession with the "only cat" line - really. I am probably in the minority with this but it just didn't matter that much to me. The scene was still very powerful and well done almost dead on exactly like in the books but even more visually stunning because the set they created for the throne room / moon door and the costumes for all the actors combined with amazing acting on all their parts .... it was all such a visual treat - how can anyone nitpick that one tiny exception... it's as if seeing "Only Cat" written thousands of times on this forum in discussions and debates leading up to the episode turned it into an obsession. Bleh.
Â 
So he said "your sister" to make it more clear than "Only Cat" - well ok - so? They really only said "Cat" a couple of times in the entire 4 seasons and it was a somewhat obscure nickname unlike in the books where we had Littlefinger's words and thoughts quite often in reference to the pet name from their childhood.
Â 
I'm just not that bothered by the change. There was so much more wonderful and amazing about the scenes I'd rather praise than nitpick.
4979	Trillian	2014-05-19	It's probably just me, but I genuinely don't find it a big deal. For me the scene worked well in the end, I have to say I am more bothered by the lack of Marillon and prophecy scene, if anything. I'll have to be honest here, when LF said "your sister", the first thing I thought "Oh no! Now everybody is gonna complain about it!". I can even understand the choice, it's less punchy - that I'll admit -, but it is a bit more immediate, as the show viewer hasn't heard the word "Cat" nearly as much as the book reader.
I don't know, I am a book fan first but I do think that by now people should have accepted that the show is not the book, there will always be "disappointing changes" and if they can't, well, they probably should just stop watching

A: "Your Sister"
Q: What does Petyr Baelish not say to his wife at the end of "A Storm of Swords"?
4981	Matoro	2014-05-19	I guess I really don't get the whole obsession with the "only cat" line - really. I am probably in the minority with this but it just didn't matter that much to me. The scene was still very powerful and well done almost dead on exactly like in the books but even more visually stunning because the set they created for the throne room / moon door and the costumes for all the actors combined with amazing acting on all their parts .... it was all such a visual treat - how can anyone nitpick that one tiny exception... it's as if seeing "Only Cat" written thousands of times on this forum in discussions and debates leading up to the episode turned it into an obsession. Bleh.


Â 
Exactly. It's an obession.
Â 
I think the scene worked perfectly as it was. If I didn't knew that Baelish originally said "Only Cat", I wouldn't even bothered to think about it. The scene worked, the dialogue worked. I don't see problem.
4982	Diego_Stark	2014-05-19	The Only Cat chapter of Storm of Swords is one of the most memorable. The first time I read it my jaw completely dropped at everything that was happening. I just don't understand why they changed the line. It completely ruined the moment for me.
4983	Trillian	2014-05-19	I agree, as I said on a different thread. Saying that the name "Cat" has been mentioned in season one a couple of time is not really a strong argument, that was three years ago. Unsullied probably don't ever remember that.
Unfortunately the show couldn't match the book on highlighting the depth of LF/Cat childhood relationship, therefore I don't see the change of this specific line as unforgivable.Â

4986	ovis alba	2014-05-19	I actually liked "your sister". I have the feeling in some way I think it's even worse for Lysa than "Cat", because it also degrades herself to being the "worse copy" of her sister as referring to Cat as the sister, makes her the "other sister" thus defining her not even as a own personality, but just the "attachment" to someone. So she's not even a general second choice but just by chance related to the one LF actually loved. To me that seems like a dagger in the heart even more.
4987	Batman	2014-05-19	Very disappointing. Next thing you know and "Ed, fetch me a block" will be changed completely.Â
4988	Onion Seaworth	2014-05-19	I was suprised yes...I don't think it matters at all though.
It would have been satisfying if he had said
Only your sister...
''what''?
Only Cat. Push
Â 
But I don't really see a problem, many show watchers are fucking idiots, who forgets 90% of the names and plot lines, so it was necessary.
Â 
So in short, I dont care about this change not better not worse, but i still would have liked to hear only cat but if i am without it I donA¤t mind.
4989	C0bR	2014-05-19	What's with the butthurt? "Only Cat" is somehow memorable solely because it happens in that scene, not because of some amazing quality of that line. "Your sister" works in exactly the same way and is apparently better for the show watchers to understand.

This is true, but why is it easier? That's what confuses me about it the change. Although it's ultimately inconsequential, it's an utterly pointless one. I know there's a lot of names to remember but any show-watcherÂ thatÂ doesn't remember who Catelyn Stark is should not have any allowances made for them whatsoever.Â 
Â

I totally agree. Having read the books I feel that the change of line dosen't really make a difference and like you said, the show for obvious reasons could not explore the complexity of Baelish's relationship with Catelyn. In a way I think the line "your sister" probably added more effect in the scene than if they used the "Only Cat" line.
4995	ovis alba	2014-05-19	This is true, but why is it easier? That's what confuses me about it the change. Although it's ultimately inconsequential, it's an utterly pointless one.

Â 
I think people would know who Cat is, but I don't think in the show there is much "emotional impact" of the nickname. It's more often used in the books and there it is usually used in a context of people that were very close to her. So in the books LF calling her Cat, is not just stating her name, but calling her Cat also expresses how close he felt to her.
In the show I think that connection is not there to this extent, so I don't think Cat compared to Catelyn would have made much of a difference on the show.

Â 
Eh I guess it's one of these things that will irk some more than others. While I'd rather they stuck with the correct line, (especially since so much of this episode was pretty much lifted from the pages) it really doesn't make much difference in the grand scheme of things.Â
4997	Greywolf2375	2014-05-19	My guess is that they know a lot of casual viewers have trouble with the names, to say nothing of nicknames, and didn't want anyone to remotely confused about who LF was referring to.
Â 
Although I agree that "Only Cat" would've been a cooler line.
Â 
Still, it was a great scene nonetheless.


Â 
Â 


There is only one group of people that care about the change. Only book readers. *Pushes all of you out the moon door*


Â 
Â 


No kidding. The only reason "Only Cat" is a memorable line is because it happened right before Littlefinger pushed Lysa out the moon door. Saying "your sister" was Littlefinger conveying the same message to Lysa, the scene was powerful the way they did it and it accomplished the same thing the book accomplished. What's the problem?
George could have wrote "Poop" before Littlefinger pushed Lysa out and I bet it would hold the same reverence with some book readers as "Only Cat" because it was a shocking, memorable moment and it was the last thing people read before that shocker.


Â 
Â 


A lot of people would have no idea who "Cat" was. It's sad, but it's true.


Â I thought, based on the comments from prior episodes, that the unsullied were smart enough to pick up on the subtleties of the show - how is it that on one hand they can pick up on subtleties yet on the other hand wouldn't be able to remember a character we have had a number of scenes about?Â  A character who was plastered all over the internet after the Red Wedding?Â
4998	ovis alba	2014-05-19	As i said before: I actually think in the show universe the "sister" makes a lot of sense, because it has a diffrent note to it. It's a diffrent one than "Cat" (which emphazises more how much he loved Cat), but "sister" feels a little more degrading towards Lysa.
4999	boojam	2014-05-19	It's just a guess.Dave and Dan give the seasons scripts to some HBO exec who reads them and comments?Well HBO does pay for the whole production.So this exec says to Dave or Dan ..."Who is Cat?"

Â 
EXACTLY! The Red Wedding, rightly or wrongly, is what most people now associate GoT with at this point. If people don't know who Cat is, they probably shouldn't be watching the show. With that said, I have no problem with the substitution.Â
5002	igrewupinKL	2014-05-19	Not going to lie, was devastated that the line wasn't 'only cat'. Oh well. I really enjoyed Lysa's actress, she did a phenomenal job. Almost made me feel sorry for Lysa!

5003	Trillian	2014-05-19	They could have made everyone happy with "Only Cat, your sister". Â

I accept that reasoning. Though they could have had him say "only your sister...only Cat" and everyone would have been satisfied. This is kind of like if the HP movies changing Snape's line of "always" to "yeah." Ah well, it is what it isÂ

Haha, wrong. Â They could NEVER make some of you happy. Â  If they'd have made the line "Only Cat, your sister", then we'd still have a 20+ page thread complaining that the "your sister" part was unneeded and ruined the scene. Â Â
5006	IlAovatar	2014-05-19	I loved the scene. Not because I thought it was brilliantly done, but because I could just imagine the look on thousands of fans' faces when the changed line came out.
Â 
It's such a trivial issue... and referring to that scene from the books as "Only Cat" always seemed incredibly hokey and lame to me anyway.
5007	sj4iy	2014-05-19	I think "your sister" makes more for the wider show audience. There are way more lines from the books that I'd rather see, to be honest, and other things from that scene, like Marillion

The delivery wasn't exactly that great but it was one of Aidan Gillen's stronger scenes despite that. He's still way too over the top for my tastes, though. He plays LF with almost no nuance at all. He's so heavy handed with how he acts that I find it hard to believe that anyone in the show's universe would trust him at all. But that's another issue.

Um.. I have to disagree. This is a TV audience, not a book reading audience. Certain things have to change.. certain liberties need to be taken.. certain lines and scenes need to be rejigged etc. And more importantly, TV viewers sometimes need their hands held. This scene, with this contentious line, was one of them.
Â 
"Who's Cat?" would've been the question on the lips of 50% of the TV audience if it was used. Now, EVERYBODY knows that Petyr killed her over her sister. However.. the TV audience may not remember who her sister actually was, but that's another matter for another day
5014	King Nothing	2014-05-19	Great episode. There is really no way to justify being upset over 2 words changing. Book readers (to be more accurate: westeros book forum members) just feel personallyÂ hurt that one of their favorite book phrases was left out. All the excitement and then....something different. It was a punch to their fandom.
Â 
I just wish they would be honest and base their argument on their personal attachment to that phrase and not try to argue "your sister" actually affected the scene. Honestly, it comes off as rather pathetic.

This could be a reference to the wights, or just to Sansa's blue eyes and her threat.
5019	Princess of Ice and Fire	2014-05-19	I have been absolutely captivated by George RR Martin's prose from the time I read the story of the children finding the litter of direwolf pups.Â  His words are powerful.Â  I must confess I also loved 'Beauty and the Beast' but I had no idea that Martin had been involved in that television series and that I was already a fan.
Â 
His words DO matter.Â  The poetry of his prose is to be savoured.Â 
Â 
There is no way that I would normally read this style of fiction, but his genius transcends the genre.Â  A good writer is always worth reading, and a powerful dramatist is always worth watching.
Â 
If William Shakespeare were alive today I am positive he would not be writing tragedies and comedies for Stratford-on-Avon or the London West End or even Broadway.Â Â  He would be creating his own world of kings and queens and magic for the HBO rather than Hollywood...
Â 
The real issue for the actors is that there are no small parts, just like in Shakespeare's plays - the roles are what you make of them - and what a pleasure it is to see some magnificent acting in Game of Thrones.Â  And what a shame when the scriptwriters are inferior to the original dramatist, as in the episode where they missed the most beautiful romantic line that Jaime had about rescuing Brienne because he dreamed of her.Â 
Â 
When I think of 'Gone With The Wind' (Margaret Mitchell) and 'Pollyanna' (Eleanor Porter) both films ended up with better scripts than they had in the original novel, by virtue of having a team of more skilled dramatists involved with the production.Â  Unfortunately the scriptwriters and producers do not have the talent ofÂ  Walt Disney or George RR Martin to improve on his best lines which is such a shame.
Â 
"Only your sister - only Cat" would have been a much better ending as many have said here.Â  The script DOES matter, because they are not doing justice to one of the best dramatists of our time.

Â 
I think one should also not make the viewers more stupid as they are. I'm sure most should would have known, who Cat is (as LF talks about her before to Sansa and Lysa talks about her right before), so that's really not the issue, I think it's really more the fact, that "Cat" as a nickname doesn't mean much "emotionally", because it's not only short for Catelyn but there is a personal connection to it when said in the books.

Yup. I don't think there was anything else to it beyond that and a small reference to the wights from the writers. Lysa was referring to Sansa and only Sansa. It was a threat. I highly doubt it was anything beyond that.

5024	Chebyshov	2014-05-19	I just remembered that in a podcast interview with Bryan Cogman, he explained that they changed the line "Jaime Lannister sends his regards" because it seemed really confusing; people might have thought that Jaime was the one who orchestrated the whole thing, or that he somehow had more of a role in it than it seemed. So for them to change iconic lines, it's likely to avoid confusion.
Â 
However, I don't think that should have been a worry; Catelyn has been mentioned how many times this season? Plus Lysa said in the scene how Sansa is just like her mom and will never love LF back, so if LF then said "only Cat" (or Catelyn), who else would he possibly have meant? It's not a big deal, it doesn't change the plot, but it's disappointing that the writers think they'd need to hold our hands that much.Â 
Â 
The other option, that it tied into the sibling theme of the episode, is preferable, IMO, but either way I think it just took a little something away from the scene.
Â 
At least we know we're going to get Oberyn's "I'm going to kill that."

He can say 'your sister' and then pause for effect, look wistful and say 'only Cat' as if he's saying it to himself. Â Problem solved. Â Everyone happy.

Also, in a show where HBO thinks apparently that no one can remember who Cat is, the idea that the blue eyes staring at nothing is some kind of oblilque foreshadowing reference to wights in the Vale seems highly improbable.

A bit wordy compared to the original 2 words, yes. But only when making that comparison, which is what I was doing. I actually said I liked the proposed change since it keeps the original line intact while holding the viewers' hands like they apparently believe should be done.
5027	AzorAhai42	2014-05-19	I think the obsession is justified. The coldness and personalness of "Only Cat" just is not the same as "Your Sister" (He didn't say "Only Your Sister", btw, I noticed someone said that). It's an obsession for a reason.
5028	kidlatxo	2014-05-19	Not sure... But wasn't there supposed to be no screams and a blank face from lysa? I think that would have been a more powerful ending especially if the camera follows her fall
I could actually just open up kindle and go look up the actual chapter, but fuck the accessibility and I just wanna post something in this thread damn
5029	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-19	You're right that Lysa doesn't scream in the book. She just falls in quiet, shocked disbelief.
5030	David Selig	2014-05-19	I don't care that much "Only Cat" wasn't there (though "Only Catelyn" would've been clear enough for even the dumbest viewer and it would've made much more sense), but they omitted many of the the details which make the scene so effective in the books - Lysa's explanation that she helped LF so much and dedicated herself to him, that she got him his first job and a job in the capital later, her pregnancy and abortion before she was forced to marry Jon Arryn, she wrote the letter to Catelyn which got the whole mess started, etc - and she was cruelly betrayed seconds later.
5031	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-19	Right. If anything, "Your SISTER" strikes a harder blow towards Lysa.

Â 
Yeah, I think the exclusion of these details was definitely a larger problem (especially because Sansa was privy to the entire conversation). Lysa even lists the ingredients for Moon's Tea, which I thought maybe would be used by Sansa later? And it would have helped flush out LF's characterization a bit more; it would show just how cold and calculating he really is.

It was odd that they didn't Â have Sansa find anything out, maybe they thought TV viewers would find the idea that Sansa would still trust LF after learning he is the one who basically tricked her family into conflict with the Lannisters to be far fetched, and make her appear too stupid.
5034	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-19	Right. If anything, "Your SISTER" strikes a harder blow towards Lysa.
How so? Lysa knows Cat was her sister. Cat is a nickname that the people closest to Catelyn used. So when Petyr says that to her right before pushing her out the Moon Door, he drove home that he was really close to Cat in a way Lysa never would be. It's incredibly cold and cruel, especially coming after Lysa's admission of complete devotion to Petyr.
5035	ovis alba	2014-05-19	Â Cat is a nickname that the people closest to Catelyn used.


Â 
But exactly this is something that is not really that established in the show. LF just saying Cat without this connection would not be the same either, because the whole deeper meaning behind it wouldn't be there without the books. it might be for book readers, because they take their "connection" to the word Cat from the books, but in the show universe only, Cat doesn't have much impact on its own.

Â 
The line is diffrently effective. It points out that the only reason for Lysa was her being related to Catelyn. This "degrades" Lysa as a person (sorry, I can't find the best translation for that) because she is made once more aware of the fact, that she is just a inferior version of her sister.

Well, Sansa can't brew moon tea by just hearing the ingredients (if those are the ingredients instead of stronger abortificents) in a very dangerous situation. So, if Sansa uses Moon Tea either in the show or the books, she'll ask a maester to brew it or fetch it, maybe through a third party.

lol I don't have a link, but there's a topic on asoiaf on reddit that asks what single change would ruin the show for you or something, and the highest rated response was "If Littlefinger doesn't say "Only Cat"."

Then you still lose the "intimacy" this name represents. The line changes the impact a little, yes, but to me in the context of the show that makes sense.
In the books this scene also leads up directly to Lady SH, so it's also making the connection and is to some extent also a little more about Cat than Lysa.
In the show they somehow maybe made it more about Lysa and her relationship with LF (as you also won't have Cat still for a while) and for this the "sister" works quiet nicely, imo.

Thanks, guys. I appreciate the clarifications. I still don't think the line in the show was as poetic (not sure if that's really the right word) as it was in the book. But you both make good points. Far better than some of the other points I've seen about the change. Â

Well, I never said it was perfect.

Perfect is such a difficult thing. But yes, maybe "only your sister" - pushing her and while she starts falling - "only cat" might have been a solution that would have also added some little extra for the bookies, but I just understand the change, because to me it's not just a "viewers are stupid thing" but actually I see a reasoning behind it.
Â 
Concerning the viewers wouldn't know who Cat is: look at how they reintroduced the Mountain, there was way less done there to clarify who he is than there would have been in this scene (with all of them talking about sansa's mother just before) and here they even changed the actor. So I don't see this as a main reason.

Agreed. Plus we've seen LF specifically calling her "Cat" (when he teleported to Renly's camp back in S2).
5050	Raffles	2014-05-19	Two words.. that's all they are.. two words. The avid book reader put too much emphasis on the line, whilst the TV viewer couldn't care less. I guess the TV viewer won this particular contest?

that, and the fact that lysa hated catelyn because of LF's attraction towards her. he's reminding her that she's her sister, and that it was always her sister.
5052	Stannisneverlikedcats	2014-05-19	It's people's expectations that ruined the scene rather than the dialogue change. If it bothered you then it's because you were more interested in him saying a memorable line instead of what was going on in the story. HE JUST MADE LYSA FLY! Isn't that what matters?

You're referring to the lack of Lysa's admissions? I can only assume it's because viewers would not understand why Sansa keeps helping a man who deliberately brought about the Starks misfortune... It's true book sansa doesn't really dwell on it in the book, and that always confused me, I was expecting a change in her relationship with LF in DWD because of what Lysa said but if I recall she only thinks about it once and goes on being Alayne.Â

Â 
Totally agree. That entire scene was so amazing... just look at the visual eyecandy - the costumes, the moon door, the throne in the background. The actors all three did spot on performances - the intensity in that room was heavy ... and yet there's a 10+ page thread full of complaining about those two words being changed from the books. It wasn't THAT big a deal, was it?Â  
Â 
I get it that everyone has their 'moments' and one-liners in the books that they are attached to - but I don't really see the need to tear apart an entire scene that was superbly acted and created just because they changed the wording at the very end. Lysa's face when he said it, and as he pushed her were priceless and worth a hundred "only cat" lines in the book honestly. It's my imagination visually come true on the show!
5058	Pablosplinter	2014-05-19	Personally I thought Only Cat would have been a much, much better line, so I am disappointed that they changed it.

It's just that I keep anticipating and looking forward to certain book lines being said in the show, and then they go and change it. I agree in the long run, changing it to "your sister" isn't that big of a deal. But look how iconic Only Cat is, this thread is titled Only Cat, when people mention it in the forums, all one needs to say is Only Cat and we know exactly which scene you mean. So yeah, it was a bit of a letdown.
5061	Tywin's bastard	2014-05-19	Obsessing about that is for me a perfect example of where someone can't separate their own infatuation for the original from what's actually important.
5062	William Campbell	2014-05-19	Another pointless change again.Â  And another regurgitation of the same dumb meme argument: They changed x to x because of dumb viewers.Â  Apparantly there is no other argument to use anymore.Â  They can't use this old favorite: They changed x to x because of the budget.Â  Because obviously it costs nothing for the actor to say, "Only Cat" instead "your sister."Â  Really the little changes like this are pointless. The so-called dumb viewers, and I'm sure there are plenty, don't follow the storyline or the characters anyway.Â  It's pointless to pander to them.Â  They are just waiting to see boobs and someone get killed.Â  I'm sure the same dumb viewers who wouldn't know who Cat is, wouldn't know who Lysa's sister is either.Â  I'm sure they also don't know who Lysa is.Â  Really they wouldn't, and they probably don't care much or they would re-watch other episodes to find out. Besides Cat has been used throughout the series to describe Cat the character.Â  I'm starting to think that it's the writers that are dumb, and not so much the viewers.

Lysa falling silently in the books was a bit too corny for my taste too, just wanted to point that out.

yeah, its not that much of a bother, it means the same thing, a lot of unsullied would get the meaning but a significant proportion probably wont, and in that situation it would just be very confusing (taking it to mean an actual cat) this way everyone knows what he is talking about
its kind of like 'the lannisters send their regards' line change in S3 its not ideal for me as sullied but i'm willing to admit overall it doesnt matter and it was probably better for the show to go with that for the sake of the unsullied
also... imagine how many memes would have been spawned had he said 'only cat' lol
5068	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-19	I was a little disappointed in the scene, to tell the truth. Â I thought it was a bit rushed. Â Sansa needed at least another 60 seconds to establish the emotional weight of the castle-building scene before Robin showed up, maybe more, and there was filler material in this episode that could've been sacrificed to make room (hello shirtless Mountain). Â I was very disappointed that there was not another person in this room because Littlefinger's "This singer's killed my lady wife" is a very nice zinger to end the scene on (and it could've just as well been "this servant" or whatever). Â Ties up all the loose ends with one quick, fancy bow, because youÂ knowÂ Sansa's going to go along with his story. Â 
Â 
Also - I don't have the book text in front of me, so maybe someone can correct me, but weren't the movements choreographed in the book such that was a little more organic that Littlefinger should be standing there with Lysa in his arms next to the Moon Door, and not quite so obvious that he had moved over there to kill her? Â On the show you would have to have been a little bit dense not to see what was coming.
Â 
"Only Cat" was kind of low down my list of criticisms of the scene, but I do think it's a better line than the one they used.
Â 
I'm not saying the scene was bad, but it could've been better, and the production values have been so high this season that I was expecting better.
5069	ovis alba	2014-05-19	Sometimes i can really not tell anymore if people are serious
5070	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-19	The power of the "Only Cat" isn't in the words, it's the action that follows it. If LF says "Your sister" in the books and they changed it to "Only Cat" on the show everyone would be bitching about how the changed it. It's not like Only Cat was beautiful word usage, people are just attached to it because it's a monumental scene. I was on board with the complaints about "Jaime Lannister sends his regards" vs. "The Lannisters send their regards" because it actually is a change. This isn't a change, it's the same thing, it's equally impersonal and rude and meant to hurt/reveal, and it's even the same amount of words.
5071	Wunhopkuendo	2014-05-19	People, how do we know that multiple version were not filmed and they chose the one that sounded best on screen? Maybe Aiden just couldn't deliver "Only Cat" or that it just sounded cheesy when they tried it. Very few of the changes made in the show are arbitrary. Unless you are in the editing room and know that they didn't try out different version for a fact you need to stfu.

It's funny, it'sÂ like you don't realize that you are actually on a forum started by people who read the books and grew on people who read the books who had thousands of conversations about every detail of the books...before any of the TV show was produced.Â  So yes, when there are changes to things that are expected to happen...thatÂ obviously have impact to a large number of people...yes, there will be feedback about it.Â 
Â 
If it's such a tiny thing to change those two words...the why change them?Â  It's only two words...so why not leave the original?Â  There's been nothing I have read that has actually presented a good argument about why the change should be made, just a lot of people posting "I couldn't wait to see the outrage" or that being a "book reader" is such a horrible thing or that the unsullied - who can see the details in other episodes and figure out subtleties there - wouldn't know who "Cat" is after LF has talked about her in the way he has.

5085	Orlo_Lorolo	2014-05-19	For me it's not really the line that's the main problem. I definitely would have preferred the original line, but I think "Your sister" could have worked just as well. Somehow the scene overall just lacked punch. I know that's subjective, but to me everything felt rushed and dry I guess. Others mentioned them leaving out more details, which is probably part of it too. But there was just something about the execution. After holding Lysa close and comforting her, it should have felt like Petyr gutting her and twisting the knife with relish. Maybe whispering it in her ear before the shove, a little twisted smile on his face. It's like the one time Aidan Gillen should have really milked the moment they went with the take where he underplayed it. Replacing "Only Cat" with a line that comes across like they're making extra sure not to confuse the audience is just an easy thing to point at. Having said that though, if they were worried people wouldn't know who Cat was they could have easily slipped it into the scene right before when Petyr was talking to Sansa about her. "I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Ah, Catelyn... my Cat."Â
5086	sj4iy	2014-05-19	For me it's not really the line that's the main problem. I definitely would have preferred the original line, but I think "Your sister" could have worked just as well. Somehow the scene overall just lacked punch. I know that's subjective, but to me everything felt rushed and dry I guess. Others mentioned them leaving out more details, which is probably part of it too. But there was just something about the execution. After holding Lysa close and comforting her, it should have felt like Petyr gutting her and twisting the knife with relish. Maybe whispering it in her ear before the shove, a little twisted smile on his face.

If you didn't know at all what was coming, the scene was very shocking. Â My m-i-l called me almost immediately to say "OMG, I can't believe that just happened!" Â The whole point was to build up the tension for the twist at the very last second.
Â 
It was very impactful for those who didn't know what happened next. Â I loved it even though I did know and loved how it played out. Â I don't see how it doesn't have 'punch' because two little words were changed.

5087	Strytos	2014-05-19	I understand that they didn't use "Only Cat", because half the audience would half asked "Who is Cat?" during the credits.Â 
The scene didn't work all that well for me though, because for one Sophie Turner is much too tall for Lysa to push her around. Plus, showing someone falling is clearly an extremely difficult effect to pull off, and like so many times before in tv and film, this fall didn't look exactly 'real' either.Â

It wasn't just two little words changed that bothered me, like I said. But again, it's all subjective. I can see how the event itself would be shocking to people who didn't know it was coming. I just thought Aidan Gillen's line reading in particular was lacking, in my opinion. I imagined him lulling her in with the first line and then gutting her with the last and instead I felt it was delivered in one flat tone.Â "Your sister" could have been delivered with the same icy cruelty as I heard "Only Cat" sounding while reading the book. I personally don't think he quite pulled it off, and you don't have to agree with me about that. It is still great television and I enjoyed the episode all in all. It's not that any and all deviations anger me. That last scene just let me down a bit, that's all.Â

This depends on how you interpret LF as a character. Personally I am convinced he is a sociopath. I do not believe he ever in fact loved Cat, but that was his cover story. 
Therefore I think the delivery was perfect, because a sociopath does not act out of passion. A sociopath feels no passion, and no remorse. Everything is manipulation. Nothing is ever true he just keeps providing a new lie when he is finished with an old one.
This is exactly what I saw in Gillan's performance and I think he was perfect.

Per George R. R. Martin's video interview relating to this episode, he did in fact love Catelyn.
5098	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-19	I'm not sure why anybody think LF didn't love Cat, at least at one point. It's been like 20 years and the guy still won't stop talking about her.Â

5100	Bambi	2014-05-19	Im one of the nitpicker-types but i seriously don't get the revolt around changing the line, i think its miserable to get so annoyed about it. The scene had the same meaning and also meta-meaning with this line. Case closed judge!
5101	Ankou	2014-05-19	If anything it's an improvement in spoken word because it kind of sounds like he's starting to say "you" but then it's "-r sister" OH NO!!! Shove.Â
5102	protar	2014-05-19	The lack of "Only Cat" isn't that important, but that's just why itÂ isÂ so important. It's like the lack of Renly's peach, or the lack of Jaime calling Brienne wench. They're not plot relevant but they're little in-jokes and favourite lines of the fandom. The fact that D+D somehow don't realise this and excise them indicates a complete divorce from book's fandom.Â 
Â 
Only Cat is one of those things that is seemingly so small and inconsequential that realising it's importance is like a secret test. And it's a test D+D failed.

Â

Â 
That's one problem, and frankly, I don't understand why they didn't have somebody present for the "This [singer\servant\jester\etc.] has just killed my lady wife" line. Â Not that you're really left hanging all that badly, because you know LF will have a story and you know Sansa will go along, but still, it only takes seconds to tie it all up in a neat bow. Â Why not?
Â 
A bigger problem to me was that Littlefinger was only present in the room for what? 30 seconds, 1 minute? Â In the book, he took a little time to talk Lysa down from her insanity, and in the process of that it was only natural for her to wind up in his arms . . . next to the Moon Door. Â Here - and of course I already knew what was going to happen, which makes it difficult to gauge my reactions - it seemed as if he just zeroed right in on her and walked over and pushed her. Â In this context, she would surely have taken a step to the side to get away from that big yawning Hole Of Death as LF walked toward her with that intent look. Â 
Â 
I thought the whole scene was kind of rushed, and I hate it because there was clear filler in this episode that could instead have made this scene great.

5117	MoA«t	2014-05-19	What's with the butthurt? "Only Cat" is somehow memorable solely because it happens in that scene, not because of some amazing quality of that line. "Your sister" works in exactly the same way and is apparently better for the show watchers to understand.


 
Â 


They could have made everyone happy with "Only Cat, your sister". Â 


That would have made Lysa look like she had brain damage, because Petyr has to explain to her who her Cat is.
Â 



Also, fans will always be unhappy about something.


Â 
This.
Â 
I have friends who watch with the subtitles on, because they have such a hard time with character and place names.Â 
Â 
Just because book readers know who Cat is, because they've read and obsessed about the books for decades now, doesn't mean show watchers have that same familiarity in their heads.
Â 
"Your sister" is way more personal than "Only Cat."Â 
Â 
I'd say get over it and move on, but I know that so many need something they can hate on D&D for, otherwise they wouldn't be able to get up in the morning.
5118	Lee-Sensei	2014-05-19	It's not a significant enough detail to truly warrant ppl making as big of a deal out of it as they are, IMO. The sole important factor here is that we've just seen LF make his first on-screen kill.
Â 
Lysa falling silently in the books was a bit too corny for my taste too, just wanted to point that out.


Lysa falling silently was great. She's just... gone. It's eerie.
5119	Lee-Sensei	2014-05-19	I just rewatched the scene, and Lysa (when yelling at Sansa) said "my father, my husband, my sister all stood between us and they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between me and Petyr."
Â 
Now, we know Lysa killed Jon Arryn and helped to start the war, which ultimately led to Cat's death. We know Hoster fell ill 4 years before dying, but based on this line, is there any reason to think Lysa had a hand in it? It seems unlikely (I thought the guy was just old), but I thought it was a curious line.


I wouldn't be surprised. Lysa's an ass in both the books and the show, but at least in the books she has somewhat sympathetic reasons for being the way she is (The abortion, miscarriages, stillbirths, Robert's poor health and protecting her kid). In this it's completely about LF with no reason for her to have become the ass that she is.
5120	jbob	2014-05-19	With regards to the exclusion of "Only Cat," isn't the larger problem with the scene the fact that now LF does not have a patsy?Â

Yes, but how will any of the character's find out that Petyr Baelish convinced Lysa to poison Jon Arryn and write to Catelyn.
Unless Sansa accidentally gives Petyr a truth serum or something.Â
5122	WTFSalami	2014-05-19	Yeah I don't get Littlefinger needing a patsy. The chick is clearly Fruit Loops, how much convincing would it take to get people to believe she killed herself?
Plus, how much of a cruel asshole would it make Sansa look like if she willingly allows someone she knows is innocent to take the fall? After years of abuse and witnessing so much injustice, to turn around and just participate in the same thing would be a strange turn to see play out on TV.

After years of abuse and witnessing so much injustice, to turn around and just participate in the same thing would be a strange turn to see play out on TV.Because the Lords of the Vale don't trust him that's why. In the books at least, they believe he married Lysa in order to steal the Vale from Robert (Robin in the show). And they aren't wrong. So when she mysteriously dies not long after marrying him, it looks suspicious. Very suspicious. The singer as a scapegoat is a convenient development (it's possible he even made certain he was always hanging around Lysa) he can use to try to advance his own agenda. The lords in the Vale aren't stupid. They know that Littlefinger is of fairly low birth and that he's rapidly advanced his position over the years. It's obvious why he's in the Vale and they are resistant to someone swooping in to take it away from them. Especially someone that isn't one of them.
I suppose they could have someone standing in the doorway in the next episode that could serve this purpose. But I doubt they'll go that route. That's too complicated for this show unless the plot is involves King's Landing.
All they had to do with a witness is have someone in Littlefinger's group act really creepy around Sansa (not unlike the singer in the books). It would give Sansa a reason to go with it. It wouldn't have taken much screen time. They just don't like taking the time I properly deal with Sansa's story on this show. Most of her best material just gets cut or simplified so much that it's hard to understand where TV Sansa is coming from most of the time.

Not sure why he'd need to be sneaky in this case. The show has been really heavy handed with the character (too much so, IMO) and the books have shown all of what he says in this clip in one form or another.

No, it's hardly the worst or biggest deviation. Arya's and Dany's arcs in season 2 get that award from me. But it is rather clumsy given the many possible alternatives to what they actually gave us. And it's far from the biggest problem with the scene (as others have pointed out). It's way too rushed...like with everything involving Sansa.

It wouldn't have had more impact. "Your sister" has much more of an impact within the theme of this episode, which was sibling rivalry and tragedy.
Â 
The Mountain and The Hound
Cersei and Tyrion
Lysa and Catelyn
Â 
"Your sister" is much more cruel and personally jarring to Lysa. "Only Cat" is more personal to Petyr because that's what he called her and knew her as, but acknowledging that Lysa's sister, who she has been so jealous of her whole life, is the one that he truly loved is pretty devastating to her, which Petyr meant for it to be.
Â 
The only reason people are so asshurt over this whole "Only Cat" thing is because that was the code-phrase by which every reader used to discuss this scene in the books, not because it's a more poignant or better line.Â

Or, in other peoples opinions, it is moreÂ impactful because PetyrÂ is using a pet name for her sister, not a generic description - something he does not have for Lysa.Â Showing a deeper connection for Cat than he had for Lysa.

Absoutely...so bitter
5146	phedre	2014-05-20	Well to me by specifically using "sister" it's like saying not you, but the better version of you.


Â 
Yes!
Â 


I actually liked "your sister". I have the feeling in some way I think it's even worse for Lysa than "Cat", because it also degrades herself to being the "worse copy" of her sister as referring to Cat as the sister, makes her the "other sister" thus defining her not even as a own personality, but just the "attachment" to someone. So she's not even a general second choice but just by chance related to the one LF actually loved. To me that seems like a dagger in the heart even more.


Â 
This, exactly!
By saying "Your Sister" he's driving home to Lysa that his one-true-love is NOT-LYSA, which makes it even harsher.
I loved the change.
5147	DaveyJoe	2014-05-20	How is Littlefinger going to trick the Lords Declarant? Â With an insane amount of plot armor, just like the books.
5148	Princess of Ice and Fire	2014-05-20	Actually I disagree that it is only forum members upset about this. Martin has some wonderful one liners and the world's very best authors and script writers are all watching very closely how his literary masterpiece is translated to Home Box Office. University professors will write reviews on the weaknesses of the script writers every time they miss the mark and drama courses will judge performances by the various actors.
It isn't just a matter of the fans complaining about every deviation - plenty here just love the way certain characters have been developed and extra scenes added - when they work well.
I am glad this is the hottest topic at the moment and hope it gets back to the script writers and production team that they not only have world attention but the attention of the world's best writers. They should be on notice that this is a career defining moment for all involved with GoT.
5149	Princess of Ice and Fire	2014-05-20	The producers are getting the humour right and they are getting the politics right and they are certainly getting the visual grandeur right - it is just the poetry that they are getting wrong. The most lyrical poetical lines are cut - as if they cannot hear them.

5150	DaveyJoe	2014-05-20	If the world is watching that closely, it's a testament to what D&D have achieved with the show. Â I notice that the viewership keeps climbing despite the show deviates a bit more each season, I don't think that's because people are pissed off.
5151	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-20	"Your sister" vs "Only Cat" bothered me but I realized it was just because of how highly I was anticipating it...specially after Tyrions trial being so perfect! 
But even other than that, the scene felt extremely rushed imo. I dont understand why they couldn't carve out at least 10-15mins for the scenes at the Vale...most people I spoke to are focusing on Lysa's death, that she was bat-shit crazy and needed to go and all of that...none of them are really focusing on LF...I rmr when I read that in the books I didnt give 2 figs about the consequences of Lysas death...all my mind could focus on was LF was responsible for Jon Arryns death, the start of the Stark-Lannister war and how ruthless and devious he is, killing Lysa without hesitation...
I didnt get any of that from the show, but I am planning of re watching with fresh eyes
5152	Blockfetcher	2014-05-20	I just re-read the whole Only Cat bit in the book and there's quite a lot of dialogue going on which they could have used to extend the scene. Maybe its a time issue so they just skim a lot of the dialogue and get to the point but it does make me wonder why they don't just use the dialogue already there in the book. The dialogue is just as catchy and simple to understand and surely it makes their jobs a bit easier if they can just copy and paste the things that are being said into the screenplay. The whole adapting process is something I'm pretty interested in knowing more about especially what bits of conversation are considered ok to put in the show directly and what bits need to be tweaked
5153	Princess of Ice and Fire	2014-05-20	Sorry for the triple post. I have been lurking since last year and thoroughly enjoyed the posts here on this forum. I only just registered and am still figuring out how to post.

You honestly think the entire literary world is sitting and watching with baited breath how every single line of ASoIaF is translated to screen just so they can write theses on the subject? How many University professors and professional critics do you think are hot on their computers right now, typing up 10 page critiques over the fact that the screenwriters changed the line "Only Cat" to "Your sister"? Do you honestly think that ANY professional in the field of writing (including Martin himself) thinks that this change completely invalidates the original meaning of the text in the book? Or that "Only Cat" was so transcendent in its original context as to be classified as 'poetry'? I'm starting to think that these arguments have long turned to satire because it's almost impossible to imagine that anyone could be serious in these assertions of great importance over two words.

US President Barack Obama recently quoted GoT according to one poster on this forum. The more popular this show gets the more people are getting introduced to Martin's writing. Other writers always study to learn from the Masters.

Pet name? It's not a pet name. If you call a guy named Timothy, Tim, that's not a pet name. Tiny Tim is a nickname. Tim is a short form of a name.Â
5163	A Misunderstood Skagosi	2014-05-20	First post on this forum, actually first post on any forum ever, usually I'll just read them.Â  Watched the first 3 seasons before reading all 5 books a few months before the start of this season and I'm already impatient for TWOW to come out.Â  For those who started in 1996 I don't know how you do it especially after ASOS.Â  I never planned on reading the books, enjoyed the show and figured it was fairly close to the source material. I strictly read non-fiction but was given a copy of AGOT and was surprised how enjoyable the read was and how similar it was to season 1 including a huge portion of dialouge.Â 
With that said the source of material is immense so obviously the show was going to deviate (reduntant statement) and it can be bothersome but they never strayed from the big crucial moments. I agree with some posters that "your sister" had a bigger impact than "only Cat" because it has that implication that Cat was a better version than Lysa, tough last words to hear before death.Â  She was still pushed out the moon door so no big changes. Also correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't the moon door in the books on the wall and not the floor?
I like the speculation on this site, even if some of it is inane.Â  So as much as I like Obyern he of course will die, in which I hope is a spectacular fight scene and it seems obvious that Shae will die as well (one of my least favorite characters).Â  It certainly will give the "unsullied" (a term I'm not crazy about and will never use again unless it's for the soldiers) a different view of Tyrion, his vengeful side at the end of the trial was widely praised.
I'm glad I found this site because it gave me more insight into the books, things that went over my head like Fry pies and I was glad to see a general consensus on Jon's parents.Â  I figured as much because I remembered an interview with GRRM about the creation of the show and when he said he asked D&D who is Jon's mother they got it correct, obviously they didn't say Wylla (I think thats the name).Â  Anyways I look forward to trying to come up with something insightful in the future

Welcome, and cheers on your first post! 
Â 
I agree about what you're saying re: Oberyn and Shae's deaths. I'm actually a bit mystified how many people argue to the contrary. But over analyzation/speculation is par-for-the-course here, likely due to us waiting 5-6 years between book releasesÂ  Â . You're also right about the Moon Door's location in the books vs. the show.
Â 
As for "Only Cat," this thread is becoming unhinged. They either changed it 1.) for clarity, or 2.) to fit more thematically into the sibling-centric nature of the episode. I was disappointed that it wasn't "only Cat," because they primed us for it (his line right before was "only one"), but they're hardly ruining the nature of the scene. Did it lose some of its eloquence in my mind? Yes. But I think the did it with good intentions, and at the end of the day my biggest gripe with this scene was how truncated and unspecific Lysa's speech was before flying.
5165	sj4iy	2014-05-20	sj4iyUS President Barack Obama recently quoted GoT according to one poster on this forum. The more popular this show gets the more people are getting introduced to Martin's writing. Other writers always study to learn from the Masters.Obama has nothing to do with what you said. He's a fan. What you're suggesting is that scholars, critics and authors worldwide are parsing the scripts, critiquing all of the changes that the screenwriters have made to Martin's 'poetic prose' and finding them flawed and losing the meaning of the original text. You're using the example of "Only Cat" being changed to "Your sister" as example of the screenwriters' inability to capture the true and deeper meaning of the original text.Now, if you can:1. Prove that literary figures worldwide think that D&D have misunderstood and misinterpreted Martin's original work2. Prove that the change of "Only Cat" to "Your sister" is an example that the screenwriters don't understand the text3. Prove that these same figures think of Martin's writing as a 'poetic masterpiece' in the first placeThen I'll take your argument seriously. Otherwise, it sounds rather overblown.

5169	Littlefingers In The Air	2014-05-20	I guess my biggest problem with the fact they didn't use the original line is that it wouldn't have take anything extra to include it. It's a three syllable line and the line they used is a three syllable line. I really don't think people are so stupid that they couldn't have remembered who Cat is or at least put it together.
