1	Ran	2013-04-21	What'd you think?
2	Tewks44	2013-04-21	Ever since I read the scene with Dany taking Astapor I've been waiting to see it.  I was not disappointed.
3	Lord Godric	2013-04-21	I don't give out tens very often, but damn! that was good.  it had many great scenes and then that final Dany scene was FANTASTIC!
4	Stallion That Mounts Texas	2013-04-21	I gave it a 9!  This episode is all about the ladies....Dany, Marg, and the Queen of Thornes.  Varys getting the wizard who cut him...I don't know about that one.  Scheming to marry Sansa to Loras?  Many changes, but I loved it.
5	Tom son of Tom	2013-04-21	8/10
Dracarys was only half as epic as I expected, but it was still pretty awesome.
6	Lany Cassandra	2013-04-21	That was a great episode!
The Dany scene was everything I hoped it would be.
7	libertine	2013-04-21	Ever since I read the scene with Dany taking Astapor I've been waiting to see it.  I was not disappointed.holy fucking shit, that was so awesome. gave me geesebumps. still does. best moment of the season so far.and of course not the only awesome moment in this episode. varys & tyrion, cersei and tywin. ramsay!! that was a 10/10, no doubt!
8	Broken Fox	2013-04-21	Everything was a solid 8. Dracarys bumped it up to a 10, though. Great episode!
9	Trebla	2013-04-21	Definitely a 10
10	Ser Farbod	2013-04-21	10.
The last 20 minutes of the episode were amazing.  The rest was pretty good.  I normally would give it a 9, but the end was so amazing, it would be criminal to give it anything but a ten.
11	ReekLeek	2013-04-21	Danys going ham on slavers bay!
12	Funkagenda	2013-04-21	Amazing episode!
Dany's part was absolutely amazing! And what about the NW part, wow. Such an amazing scene too.
And the part's with Tywin/Cersei and Varys/Olenna were also gret.
9.5/10 !
13	Blaer Dayle	2013-04-21	9.5 out of 10 (rounded up to 10), amazing dialogue, Loved the Queen of Thorns and Varys in particular, Varys isn't used to being equaled in terms of cunning, Margaery is perfect so far, Sansa was great, Bran's scene was weak in comparison to everything else, but wasn't bad by any means, finally got to see where Ramsay was going with his deception, pulling a confession out of Theon through trust, Arya finally gets to charge the Hound with the murder of Micah, he gets to defend his actions as merely being a loyal dog, Jaime and Brienne was great as usual, Jaime wanting to die but not wanting to be "weak like a woman" was great, betrayal of the Night's Watch was exactly how I imagined it in the book, finally got Varys explanation about being a eunuch, LOVED the sack of Astapor and reveal of Dany knowing Valyrian, best episode this season so far, loved every minute... except for the implication of Ros being smarter than Varys... seems like every time I see Ros I don't like the scene...

14	houseHB	2013-04-21	Best episode... I think ever
15	House Martell	2013-04-21	I don't have the balls to complain about ANYTHING, that was amazing!
16	Capt Banjo	2013-04-21	That ending was epic. The dragon, the unsullied, Dany's dialect, and everyone's reaction to her bossing the Astapor slave masters was perfect.

18	boojam	2013-04-21	What'd you think?Holy Guacamole!andRamin Djawadi hit one out the park!
19	Florina Laufeyson	2013-04-21	Danys going ham on slavers bay!It was ham with a taste of cloves and a little honey. Nom nom nom i ate it up! The Night's Watch and Craster. Oh gods..Beric fucken Dondarrion!Ramsay....ugwehhere....sadasa....So much awesome...This is probably the best of the season so far. Holy shitballs. 10 heads of the Ned.
20	Ocean	2013-04-21	Everything was fantastic this episode, every scene was just great really.  Took 3 episodes but now this season is kicking.
21	ServantOnIce	2013-04-21	Top 4 episode along with, "Baelor" "Blackwater" and "Fire and Blood"
22	Kiss of Fire	2013-04-21	Blown away.....loved from start to finish....10!
23	Nezzer	2013-04-21	Fucking 10. I have no words to say how awesome this episode was /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' />
24	Elrond Hubbard	2013-04-21	Giving it a 9, only to leave room for The Rains of Castamere to top it.  A fantastic episode from start to finish.
25	Darth Pipes	2013-04-21	I'll give it a 10.  Perfect in almost every way.
The end with Dany was epic.  They gave you a great sense of scale with the Unsullied as well.
I was impressed with Diana Rigg's first appearance as the character but tonight they really let the Queen of Thorns cut and she was a blast.
The guy playing Beric Dondarrion was pretty awesome and the scene with Clegane was great.
I'm glad Varys got his "cut" story and the addition at the end was chilling.
I said last week that Rod Serling would have called Theon's storyline act one of the nightmare.  Theon seems trapped in a recurring nightmare and that's exactly how it played out.  Ramsay kind of looks like an evil version of Peeta from The Hunger Games but I think it works.
-The Night's Watch mutiny played out well...I'm only sorry we didn't get Mormont's final words with Sam.  That was the only downside in this episode.
-Jamie and Brienne continues to play out well.  I liked the bit they added were Jamie attempts to fight back.  Apparently during the filming he took a real kick to the ribs.
Tywin saying "I know"...he didn't have to yell or evil glare at the scene but you just know he means what he said.  Great job by Charles Dance.
I'm glad they're finding way to allow Bran to "be" with his family.

26	Zman1863	2013-04-21	I gave it a 9. But that's mainly because the Dany scenes were some of the best the show has put out. She isn't generally my favorite character but that is probably a top 3 scene in all the books. It was excellently done. The rest of the episode was not really outstanding. I wasn't happy with how the NW scene played out; it seemed too chaotic. There was also a lot of filler. I think they put in the Varys/Tyrion scene because they wanted to reintroduce him for the subsequent two scenes which were more substantively important. But I thought his "cutting story" was out of place and bringing in the "revenge in a box thing" didn't really work for me. The other stuff was fine, but its still a lot of set up.
27	Arya Stalka	2013-04-21	10 So much about this episode was awesome. The Spider with Tyrion then the Lady of Thorns... Margaery working her charm... Sam manning up and rescuing Gilly... Jaime & Brienne telling him off... Arya busting out Sandor (can't wait for next epi) and finally... Dany and her army! 
Oh... lets not forget we find out Podrick is hung like a bull! Bahaha! I love that! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
ETA: Theon & the bastard! Day-UM! loved that too! I smell some "reek".

28	Ser Bronn's Mullet	2013-04-21	Remember when people said Emilia Clarke was a bad actress? Good times.
29	teratomatastic	2013-04-21	By far my favorite episode of GoT yet.  Everything about it was perfect.
30	Lyanna's rose	2013-04-21	10 10 10 10!!!!
I Loved the Varys/Tryion scene with Vary's back story. Very well done
I Loved the Brienne/Jamie scenes
Varys/ Queen of Thrones was amazing dialogue
So Glad the Ramsey/Theon came back around. I was worried they were actually going to change Theon's arc, but this was amazing. I even like Theon's monologue about Ned Stark. It's a little blunt (much like what they did with Catelyn to make her more sympathetic) but I was fine with it.
I love, Love, LOVE tv Margery!
And then there was Dany in Astapor. Amazing, and extremely well done!
Amazing episode.  Can't say it enough. Best so far!

31	ebevan91	2013-04-21	Holy Guacamole!andRamin Djawadi hit one out the park!Yeah the music during Dany's scene and the credits was incredible.
32	Mark Antony	2013-04-21	10 best episode since Blackwater imo
33	Jabronius Maximus	2013-04-21	Gave it a solid 8, this season looks very promising. Aside from Catelyn, all the book changes make sense and are working pretty consistently. Great scene with Dany too. And RAMSAY!!! That son of a bitch has the exact crazy eye look that I imagined book Ramsay would have. The actress playing Olenna is a top notch choice as well. I expected Beric to be a bit more of a badass, though. But that's just my own expectation of the Lightning Lord, as the casting for him was still very good.

34	sharkhawk	2013-04-21	Definate 10.  The Dracarys scene was as badass as the books
35	Fez	2013-04-21	A 9 for me, not quite as good as last week's 10.  Overall it was really amazing episode, with some great dialogue and moments.  Also, Beric was goddamn awesome.  But there were two issues that stopped it from being a perfect 10.
1) Jack Gleeson is so good that I legitimately can't stand watching extended Joffrey scenes.  I know that's a credit to him and the writing, but if I so can't stand a scene that I'll mute it until it's over so I don't have to listen to him, that's an issue.  I know that's my issue, but this is my rating.  Even with this, the episode would probably still be a 10, but...
2) I never much liked the Dracarys scene.  I thought it was silly in the books and I thought it was silly here.  It never made sense that the slavers would be so stupid, I don't care how "blinded by greed" they are supposed to be.  So, the music was epic and the visuals were cool, but I just didn't like the scene.  I was hoping the writers would find some sort of change to the transaction so that the end effect was the same, but that the process would make more sense.  They didn't, so the episode ended on a silly note, so its a 9.
36	Jon Wat	2013-04-21	Whoever voted 5/10 should stop watching now. It won't get much better that this. Amazing.
37	TheMountianNick	2013-04-21	Great episode,  Solid 9.  Loved it.
38	Patrick Austrian	2013-04-21	i would have to say the astapor scene was best scene in the whole series far and above... it was so perfect in every way
39	Ser Creighton	2013-04-21	Could of done with a bit more of the sacking of Astapor, thought Jamie's scenes were well done, Mormont and the watch got cut a little short as well. but really only minor details, thought most of the new stuff worked. Looks like Ros is going to find out where whores go, kind of made me smile.
9.6. Best of the year.
40	Ser Farbod	2013-04-21	Remember when people said Emilia Clarke was a bad actress? Good times.Seriously.  She became Daenerys Stormborn in so many ways this episode.  Her accent and tone were PERFECT.  Valyrian sounds amazing.  They did such a good job. I rewound her reveal 5 times and still got goosebumps each time...
41	TheMountianNick	2013-04-21	Whoever voted 5/10 should stop watching now. It won't get much better that this. Amazing.Obviously someone, who wants a page by page, word by word adaptation.I will be in the minority on these boards for saying this, but every book change, I have been behind.  The books have many short commings and I'm glad to see many exercised from the series.  I will agree Jon Snows storyline isn't as good as it could be, but up to this point in the books, it pretty much crap too.

42	Ser Steven	2013-04-21	I gave it a 10. It was definitely one of my favorites, right up there with Blackwater.
43	Heathered	2013-04-21	I am a little speechless. The best episode by far, so far! Very, very impressed. I can't wait to see what they do with other, unnamed scenes.
44	Nuncle Kraken	2013-04-21	I'm still in awe. That was so badass. What's really amazing is the quality of the acting. Jorah looking proud when Dany freed the unsullied was awesome. 
A fuckin' dragon is no slave!
45	ugashep	2013-04-21	Best episode... I think everAgree. Only the Season 1 finale compares to me.
46	DolorousKim	2013-04-21	Best episode of the Season so far, I gave it a 9.What worked for me:Queen of Thorns and Varys - Conleth Hill and Diana Rigg --two exquisite actors doing their thing.  Loved, loved this scene.  Some of Lady Olenna's dialogue seems like a direct shout-out to the readers (especially the part where she rips on the house motto of the Tyrells), and that just makes a good thing outstanding.Hound vs. BWB - Rory McCann was simply awesome in this scene.  My usual sympathies are with the BWB, but The Hound was so convincing that it had me wavering in my allegiance....Dany vs. the Slavers - Emilia Clarke's performance isn't usually at the top of my list considering the depth of this cast, but she really brought it in this episode -- she provided a truly epic moment, so some well deserved kudos to her.Brienne and Jaime - I am loving the interaction between these two, it seems to get better each week.Tywin and Cersei - Now there's the dickish Tywin that we all know so well!  Charles Dance delivers as usual, and Lena Headey succeeded in making Cersei sound both rational and sympathetic this episode, which is no small feat.What didn't work for me:Varys captures the "sorcerer"  - What, what, what are they going for here?  As much as I adore Conleth Hill, and normally dig any excuse to see him on the screen, I didn't really see the point here, other than possibly pointing out how truly dangerous Varys is, which anyone paying attention should already know.Joff and Margaery - While I haven't always dug Natalie Dormer's performance as Margaery, I think that she's been killing it this year, but Joff has suddenly gone from dangerous psycho with a slightly goofy vibe to a giddy, lovestruck schoolboy.  Not that I'm faulting Jack Gleason's overall performance, I just think that someone in production is overselling the influence that Margaery has on Joff to an almost ridiculous extreme.   We get it already, okay?Still a very effective episode overall, where even the parts that didn't totally work for me were still much stronger than previous episode weak points were to me so far this year.
47	Ser Farbod	2013-04-21	I'm still in awe. That was so badass. What's really amazing is the quality of the acting. Jorah looking proud when Dany freed the unsullied was awesome.A fuckin' dragon is no slave!Ian Glen has been amazing.  One of the most underrated actors on the show.  He really conveys so much without even talking or with the cadence and tone in his voice alone.
48	Q the Cat	2013-04-21	Seriously.  She became Daenerys Stormborn in so many ways this episode.  Her accent and tone were PERFECT.  Valyrian sounds amazing.  They did such a good job. I rewound her reveal 5 times and still got goosebumps each time...I agree. I had goosebumps when that scene started.  They did a good job, from Dany speaking in Valyrian but the head Slaver not noticing because he was busy with the dragon.   She was excellent and her character is really developing into a legitimate force!I also really liked the Jaime scenes.  They had his rotting hand around his neck and made him drink horse piss, just like in the book.  I expect the non-book reading viewers will start to have pity on his character now, too.Great episode, the best of the season for sure!
49	Arya Stalka	2013-04-21	Remember when people said Emilia Clarke was a bad actress? Good times.Right? She was perfect from the get go!
50	Ferrum Aeternum	2013-04-21	Ever since I read the scene with Dany taking Astapor I've been waiting to see it.  I was not disappointed.Same.  It is my favorite scene in all the books and they nailed it.Everything else tonight was great too.  Favorite part aside from the final scene was the look of mad twisted joy on Iwan Rheon's face when he pulls the bait-and-switch on Theon.  That look told me he'll be perfect for his role.Oh, and I gave it a 10/10.  Duh.  /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

So to respond to your comment, I will continue watching the series expecting it to get better. The Dany scene was done well but the rest of the episode wasn't, in my opinion.  The NW's scene was disappointing and the Pod joke is distracting.
52	Randyll Tarly	2013-04-21	A 10! Theon's face was priceless and Dany speaking in the valyrian tongue really owned that idiot of Astapor.

Blackwater had a small ammount of haters as well, and it was a masterpiece of television. As D&D said, you can't appeal to everyone. And neither should you.

55	franko99	2013-04-21	Fantastic episode, 10/10. Every scene was perfect, my only "problem" maybe tht we didn't get to hear Mormont dying words :'( 
Wizard in the box? whatever, perfect episode, and it only gets better from here
56	Warden of the North121	2013-04-21	Definitely a 10. Best episode other than maybe Fire and Blood of the entire series. The amazing thing is this season is only going to get better.
57	Hound Dog	2013-04-21	Dany's scenes were awesome, as was Beric/Clegane! Also so pleased to see Jaime/Brienne developing their relationship.
No Cat (save for Bran's dream) or Robb, and no Shae or Jeyne Wester--- Talisa (??), was also quite nice.
Fantastic episode!
58	piratesswoop	2013-04-21	9.5 (gave it a 9) only because of the unnecessary drawing out of the Pod nonsense and the way the mutity  at Craster's Keep seemed so rushed. Aside from that, I loved it! DRACARYS!
59	House Martell	2013-04-21	- For everyone who thought Ros was around just for the T & A, she may have a valuable role to play yet...
- Hope we get Mormonts last words some how
- Varys IS a secret Targ, how long did he plot and wait to get the sorcerer? He's up to something
60	tito5601	2013-04-21	a ten..... when dany spoke valyrian i was shaking from how powerful that scene was.     she reminded me of aegon the conqueror
61	Arrow	2013-04-21	Fantastic-So many noteworthy moments - where to start - I don't get a sense of romantic feelings between Jaime and Brienne so much as his respect for her, something new for him - I suspect he has seen more dedication and integrity in her than in most of the men he's ever known. Even though she's a formidable warrior and worthy opponent, there's a certain innocence about her that makes her character so appealing.
And Dany's segment - wow, just wow.
Varys and the sorcerer was a shocker.

It was awesome.  Hopefully that was the last we'll here about the Pod's love magic.  The CGI at the end was a bit off somehow, but a really great episode.  Loved all of the Jaime stuff.

65	Lady Lea	2013-04-21	One of the best in the series, and the best this season DEFINITELY.
It was not without flaws but the good far outweighed the bad. Even Ros wasn't unbearable.
66	Batavian	2013-04-21	Interesting the fascination with Podrick's sexual prowess. Great episode.
67	Moon-Pale Maiden	2013-04-21	DRACARYS!! DRACARYS!!!!
Wow... that was honestly the best episode of the series so far.  Mormont, Astapor, Lord Beric, Margaery, Olenna and LF...  Oh Sansa.. my heart..
I was glad to see so many thing straight from the books.  Aside from box 'o wizard, it was perfect.  I gave it a 10.
I got shivers when Dany started to speak Valyrian.  It sounded so natural. The scene was better than what I imagined from the books and yet it remained faithful for the most part. I was hooting and hollering during that whole scene.  Woo-hoo!  So glad I have HBO GO because I'm a gonna watch it again right now!

69	theJoker501	2013-04-21	Definitely best episode to date!! Looked like they changed Dondarrian's character. I doubt many people would notice though.
70	Dragonblood Stormborn	2013-04-21	Daenery's scene was perfect. It gave me goosebumps while I shouted and cheered and even cried.  it was seriously AS Badass as in the book.
71	Nuncle Kraken	2013-04-21	Ian Glen has been amazing.  One of the most underrated actors on the show.  He really conveys so much without even talking or with the cadence and tone in his voice alone.Agree strongly. Everything he does is worth watching. In a cast FULL of superb actors, he still manages to stand out without even speaking. It's part of the reason I believe after this season, it will be the best TV show ever. I'm a huge fan of The Wire. Tommy Carcetti is awesone in that show, yet the same actor playing Littlefinger gets lost in the shuffle. Amazing cast. D&D take a lot of heat, some of it deserved, but I'm so happy they put this series on TV.
72	King of the Wall	2013-04-21	Before, I didn't see the point of the Theon scenes, but now because of his cofession of not killing Bran and Rickon, saying Ned was his father and, of course, Ramsay's face when Theon is being chained up is really making me like this storyline.
Still disappointed with the Bran storyline. There is satisfactory explanation on the Reeds or a good view of their relationship with Bran. I ship Meera and Bran so I'm dissapointed they haven't exchanged words yet.
I liked that Varys could finally make his speech about his cutting, and the touch of the wizard in the box really justified it. I loved his interaction with the Queen of Thorns, but I think it was better when the Tyrells were doing that out of their own initiative. And they're implying Varys is scheming for the PW? WTF?
I liked the conversation between Cersei and the QoT, and how Margeary is able to manipulate Joffrey better than Cersei. Even Tywin points that out. And also "I don't rely on you because you're not so smart as you think you are." HAR.
Am  I the only one who pauses the show to see what Tywin is writing on his letters?
Finnally: Dany
I was standing up during the whole scene.
It was beyond epic. It was better than what I imagined when I read the books. The look on people's face when they noticed she was speaking Valyrian. Jorah and Barristan exchanging a look like "that's our girl".
The scene of the Unsullied marching out of Astapor made my heart beat faster.
I gave it a 10.
73	teej6	2013-04-21	I did not. Which part of "Everyone's entitled to their own opinion" didn't you understand?

74	Florina Laufeyson	2013-04-21	Remember when people said Emilia Clarke was a bad actress? Good times.Shes still not amazing, but shes playing with chewing the scenery and it really works right now. Shes a great ham, ill give her that. Made that scene a lot of fun. I want her to get better and she has improved.
75	Nikos Targaryen	2013-04-21	9/10. Amazing. The only reason it's not 10/10 is because of the added unnescessary scenes and deviations from the book.
76	Arrow	2013-04-21	Having not gotten this far in the books yet, I have to wonder, did Margaery arrange for the adoring crowd to be out there when she was touring the tombs with Joffrey? If so, that was quite a brilliant move on her part.

Maybe it's because I am only on the second book and watched the show first, but I really like all the characters even Shae. Emilia Clarke plays a great role in my opinion, she was green at first but starts to come out of her shell, it's exactly how she is in the book.
78	wolverine	2013-04-21	Was a little slow for a while, but the last three scenes were fantastic.  Almost had a nerdgasm during Unsullied scene.  I gave it a 9.
79	Sand11751	2013-04-21	An absolute 10, one of the best in the series ever. I've never felt so sorry for Theon, or shared an understanding of how much Cersei seeks her father's approval, or felt more proud of Daenerys.
80	Winterz	2013-04-21	This was the first time I rate an episode this season over 7. A well deserved 10, very intensive, enjoyed every second.

81	Jon Wat	2013-04-21	I do apologize for not using the quote button but I was using the abridged version of the site on my phone and the quote option wasn't available to me.  Your statements -- â<U+0080><U+009C>Whoever voted 5/10 should stop watching now. It won't get much better that this. Amazing.â<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>Blackwater had a small ammount of haters as well, and it was a masterpiece of television.â<U+0080><U+009D> -- sounds terribly condescending, that's my opinion /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />. And FYI, I did enjoy the Blackwater episode.And that was my opinion as well. I undestand how it can be considered condescending, but that was certainly not my intention. Well, no harm done.But I still would like to know the reason behind that score. 5/10 because of some Pod jokes is a bit strong.
82	mafalda	2013-04-21	I gave it a 10.
Minus Theon and "Boy", the first half was a little slow for me.. probably because I knew what was to come with Dany and Craster's Keep and just kept waiting for that! But yeah, the episode gets a 10 alone just for dracarys.
Liked:
Dany tricking Kraznys
Theon and Boy
Mutiny at Craster's Keep
The Sept of Baelor, it was gorgeous!
Olenna and Varys "What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?" Laugh. Out. Loud!
Sansa and Marg
Arya rooting out the Hound about Micah.
Did not like:
Ros and Varys. Especially the continued discussion about Pod's Package.
I was disappointed that Tywin didn't tell Cersei she has to remarry during that particular convo. But I'm sure it will pop up soon.
Varys's rushed story of how he was cut and the magician who did it. It was just rushed and weird.
Bran's brief, odd scene.
Lord Beric. Ha, drastic change from season 1 (yes I get he's not supposed to looks the same but they got a totally different actor).
Excuse me while I watch the encore and drool over Dany again /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
83	Arya Stalka	2013-04-21	Honestly I haven't seen a bad actor on this show. Maybe it's because I am only on the second book and watched the show first, but I really like all the characters even Shae. Emilia Clarke plays a great role in my opinion, she was green at first but starts to come out of her shell, it's exactly how she is in the book.I completely agree (about Emilia Clarke)  She is on screen as I imagined her from the books.  I do not like the way Royce Dotrice makes her sound on the audible, but not much could've been done about that.

84	~Shiera Seastar~	2013-04-21	9/10. Amazing. The only reason it's not 10/10 is because of the added unnescessary scenes and deviations from the book.Same here. 9 for the Jaime, Theon, Arya/Hound/BWB, Craster's keep and Astapor scenes; minus 1 for Tyrion, Varys, and Ros' scenes - they took away a lot of time in this episode if all combined together. QOT, Cersei, and Tywin's scenes are okay.

87	Ser Graymax	2013-04-21	8 because I want more!
88	Unsullier	2013-04-21	Unreal episode.  The scene with Sandor in the cave was phenomenal.  I might be the only one who thinks that Rory McCann (spelling?) is delivering the best performance of the anthology.
89	Florina Laufeyson	2013-04-21	I completely agree (about Emilia Clarke)  She is on screen as I imagined her from the books.  I do not like the way Royce Dotrice makes her sound on the audible, but not much could've been done about that.I think its fair to say that everyone rocked the smallclothes in the acting department during this episode. I hope Clarke keeps it up. A good hammy Dany is good times.
90	Died a Hero	2013-04-21	10 because no matter how hard I pushed the button, it wouldn't give out a 12.
Could quite possibility be the best episode of the series. The ending was just as epic as I thought in the book. ty god for book Dany being back.

91	ladyinblack	2013-04-21	Been a complainer about this season but tonight they did a great job. Wasn't even bothered by the sections that completely ignored the story line./don't know where they are going with Varys and Littlefinger
enjoyed The Queen of Thrones and Varys tA¨te e tA©tA¨
Emilia Clarke owned it!! she was perfect, perfect  and the the Astaphor storyline was really good
Lannister scenes excellent---such good casting for that family--all act brilliantly
Crasters---well done but where is Mormonts raven?
pacing was much improved
I am in for the season....
Ramsay story different from the book but it seems it will get to the same dark place
92	Cornishman	2013-04-21	Exceptional episode, I found it to have a certain nuance.
Sophie Turner has completely won me over.  With all the attention that Maisie Williams received from season 2 for her excellent work portraying Arya, Sohpie was overlooked somewhat.  That will NOT be the case with this season in my opinion.  Her scene with Margery was incredible work, it won't surprise me if HBO submits it to the Emmy committee for consideration.  A slight deviation from the books of course, the suggestion for her to marry Loras as opposed to his brother, but a forgivable one when you see the performance Sophie turned out responding to that suggestion.  I've never been a Sansa fan in the books, nor the HBO adaptation, but Sophie Turner's portrayal has slowly been building block by block this season, and I believe episode 4 tonight isn't the culmination, but merely the jump off point to some incredible performances yet to come.  I'm very, VERY encouraged, and looking forward to more.
I watched this episode tonight at a friends place with a 30+ foot screen home theater room, with a couple dozen other friends and co workers.  Dany's final scenes, the last five minutes or so, the place was pandemonium, and when she gave her Dracarys order to Drogon, I couldn't even hear any of the actors words for the next minute as everyone was going berserk cheering.  
Compared with season 2, it's my opinion that HBO and the production team has really increased the tempo much sooner this year.  If this is what we can expect this early in season 3, I have great expectations for what is yet to come.
10/10 from me, hands down my favorite episode in the entire series so far, with episode 9 from season 2 of course being the "gold standard".

93	Magic 8 Ball	2013-04-21	10/10, I actually like Dany now!
Too bad I know it's all downhill from here.
94	Ser Creighton	2013-04-21	You know Dany is getting a lot hype this episode EmilIa deserves it. But I thought one of the more intrestinng moments of the Episode was Theon's reveal about his feelings about Ned Stark. It's a moment where Theons reality check sinks in hard for him and shortly after that reality real does set in. It's change from the books, but I can understand it, he met his real father, dude is a first class turd, and the man who raised him the last 10 years of his life was everything to him his own father wasn't.
95	Ser Creighton	2013-04-21	oh and we have the first four, bet someone throws something lower than a 4 up there just so they can be the person to give it the lowest score. A 4? The setting, sets, props, film location and special effects alone are enough to give it a better score than that any day of the week.
Let me guess Dany wasn't wearing the right dress, or Theon should not be in the episode, or the Nights watch outfits are not black enough. A 4? Come on, that's a BS a score, if you don't like the show that much you might want to watch something else. I want to see the full 4 review, show me all the bad.
96	The She Wolf	2013-04-21	WOWOWOWOW
Loving the Tyrell women. Both were fantastic.
NW at Craster's Keep was perfect. Poor Old Bear /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
Brienne & Jaime scenes were gold.
Tywin's lines were epic. Really gave off the 'you don't mess with this guy' vibe
Lots of Varys. A lot of new (non-book) stuff there but the actor is so good he makes it work for me.
Theon's breakdown and then getting a taste of deception. Well done there.
Beric Dondarrion came across as epic as he does in the books. The Hound and Arya were both great in that scene. It was really the highlight of the episode but then...
WOWOWOW Dany! She just blew my mind today. Everything about that scene was so perfect. WOW!
10/10 /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
97	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-21	I gave it an 8, although I might change it to a 9. 
Pros:
-That AMAZING deranged look in Iwan Rheon's eyes when Theon is recaptured. Dude was born to play Ramsay
-Speaking of Boltons, does anybody else think Burn Gorman would make a good Roose?
-Burn Gorman is Craster's reckoning
-Final scene was good, but I imagined it to be a lot more climactic and brutal, just to drive home Dany's conqueror side
-Marge/Joff was surprisingly good. It's amazing how Gleeson manages to humanize such an utterly repulsive character
-High Valyrian sounds great, and Clarke did a good job in that final scene
-Cersei/Tywin. Now THAT'S how you create a new scene while staying true to the story and characters. Oh, and really liked the repeated close-up of Tywin's letters
-Jaime/Brienne-good as always. I don't think NCW said 5 words in the entire episode, but still managed to remain captivating
-Theon's monologue-apart from the Ned being his real father bit.
-Hound/Dondarrion scene was good
Cons:
-Big HUH? on Varys finding the sorcerer. Although it does illustrate his power, it just was a bit surprising. Not sure how to react to it.
-NO MORMONT'S LAST WORDS???? ARE YOU SERIOUS? The Old Bear deserved better. Far better. 
-I heard a lot of talk about how the episodes are longer this year, but so far, they seem to be the same length as last season
-Varys' monologue about his castration. I imagined it to be quite ominous. IDK, it just felt too matter-of-fact to me
98	Cornishman	2013-04-21	You know Dany is getting a lot hype this episode EmilIa deserves it. But I thought one of the more intrestinng moments of the Episode was Theon's reveal about his feelings about Ned Stark. It's a moment where Theons reality check sinks in hard for him and shortly after that reality real does set in. It's change from the books, but I can understand it, he met his real father, dude is a first class turd, and the man who raised him the last 10 years of his life was everything to him his own father wasn't.I agree 100% with this.  I had actually forgotten about mentioning this when I wrote my post, as SO much happened in tonight's episode.  I'll be re watching it again several times tonight - as I said, nuances.I've complained numerous times here that the sense of scale in terms of the size of the forces was a huge weak point in the entire series.  Even in "Blackwater", if you count the number of troops on screen, even at the maximums, you get a company or a very light battalion's worth of troops on the screen at any given time, hardly the numbers that GRRM has represented in the books.  As much as I hated to compare "Spartacus" to GOT, this was one place where Spartacus actually did a good job, of giving the viewer scenes with HUGE numbers of forces in the field.Well, tonight, the HBO team really hit the nail right smack on the head with the Unsullied representations, particularly in the final scene - that is how deployed forces should appear in the ASOIAF world: regiments and regiments of troops.  I can't wait for more, I hope they follow suit with the other major houses and their forces in the field in future episodes.
99	Er Rn	2013-04-21	8/10.  
I love Varys but his scene with Tyrion and the sorcerer was kinda wtf? for me. That and his scene with Ros were my least favorite parts of this episode.
But overall I loved it. The QoT and Marg get better with every episode.
100	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-21	This episode was good, but I really don't get the love that's been showered on it. It was no Baelor or Blackwater. I really wish I could enjoy this as much as everyone seems to be, but I just don't understand what's so extraordinarily good about it.
101	Winterfellian	2013-04-21	This episode was good, but I really don't get the love that's been showered on it. It was no Baelor or Blackwater. I really wish I could enjoy this as much as everyone seems to be, but I just don't understand what's so extraordinarily good about it.I actually agree with you. I like it fine, but am far from being as impressed people here seem to be /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' /> It was the best episode so far though. I give it an 8.
102	teej6	2013-04-21	This episode was good, but I really don't get the love that's been showered on it. It was no Baelor or Blackwater. I really wish I could enjoy this as much as everyone seems to be, but I just don't understand what's so extraordinarily good about it.I totally agree
103	Lord of Cheese	2013-04-21	I gave it an 8. I probably should have given it a 7.
-1 for the stupid Bran scenes. This is starting to get a little ridiculous with him running through the woods chasing the 3ec. Then flashbacking to Jojen. Its just pointless.
-1 for the ever greater possibility that we will not get to see Sam the Slayer. (I would have given a 10 if they showed Sam the Slayer!!)
-1 for dragging on with the scene between Joff and Marg. Its just dumb. It didnt add anything. No charcter development at all. No story advancement.
But overall it was a pretty damned good episode.
104	Lord of Cheese	2013-04-21	This episode was good, but I really don't get the love that's been showered on it. It was no Baelor or Blackwater. I really wish I could enjoy this as much as everyone seems to be, but I just don't understand what's so extraordinarily good about it.I totally agreeI agree here too. I think its just the dragons at the end. It was pretty powerful way to finish and, alas, thats what ppl remember most.
105	Steve Stark	2013-04-21	Earns a 9 from me. I'd give it a 9.5 if I could. It was not a perfect 10, but I will say that it was probably my favorite episode thus far. 
I was also surprised to hear my wife say that she liked this one. She's not too into the show, so that's saying something. If non-regular watchers watched this one they might be hooked now. I think the episode was very well done.
There were differences, of course, but for the most part I enjoyed them and it was good television.
EDIT: Now that I see people asking why some of us think it's so good, I'll answer that with the word "momentum". It had great dialogue, story movement, and you got to see most of the characters, but more than any of that the momentum of the episode was perfect.

106	Valyrian Badass	2013-04-21	I gave it a solid 10! the ending was sooooo awesome! I couldnt sit still in my chair waiting for Drogon to burn the astapori. Brienne's reaction to jamie whining was just pefection... im so happy those two are helping eachother out.
107	buff daddy	2013-04-22	I gave it a 6. Some of the scenes were great and just full of awesome drama but there were some scenes that just felt like fanfiction that didn't do anything to move the plot forward. Episode just felt really uneven to me.
108	Words of Winter	2013-04-22	10.The last 20 minutes of the episode were amazing.  The rest was pretty good.  I normally would give it a 9, but the end was so amazing, it would be criminal to give it anything but a ten.Well, I guess I'm criminal.  Don't get me wrong, I want to give it a 10, but that means that this is as good as it gets.  One of the best of the shows if not the best.  The ending was epic.  So I give it a 9.25.  I still want them to get better.This episode had the most consistent acting from everyone, even Samwell, Sansa and Ros which had some weak outing of resent.  Thank the gods, hee hee, Shae was not involved.  It would have brought it down to 8.The only two cons I really saw wasThe segway to Vary's cutting story.  It didn't flow into it well, but it was acted well nonetheless.Sansa and Loras was expected, even though it is not in the book.  He reaction was well done. A little forced, but not enough for me to say in my head, "hey, she is just acting."Great job.
109	pntrlqst	2013-04-22	I gave it a nine. The Bran scene really didn't need to be here... or, at least, it should have had more meat to it. Not much to complain about, other than the Varys/Ros scene being a little dull, but serviceable for progression of that particular storyline. Starting with the Vayrs/Olenna scene, the episode sustained a brilliance unmatched by any of the other three episodes this season.

110	Nictarion	2013-04-22	That was a 10! That was easily my favorite episode to date. Dracarys is my favorite part of the books and now the show as well, I am so glad they did it justice.
111	Robin Of House Hill	2013-04-22	10/10.  The first episode this season I really enjoyed.  Sorry to see the Lord Commander go, but knew that would happen.  It was fun to watch Varys and Tywin, this episode.  Dany's scene stole the show.  That was fantastic.  I must admit I will miss Kraznys.  I've known people like him and he nailed it.
The only thing that annoys me is that they didn't release a soundtrack album, this season, which assuredly would have had the end credits music.  I hate the thought of having to download it from you tube when some thief uploads it.
112	Talbot	2013-04-22	A very strong 9.
Jaime/Brienne continue to provide the best character interactions on the show.
Theon's arc is a wonderful insight/deviation. I don't care if people deem it "unnecessary", I would rather have brilliant inessentials than following the book to a word. Sue me, I love it.
RIP Old Big Bear, he loves the honey. Well shot, intense, violent scene at Crasters. My show-only friends stopped what they were doing once Craster stood up, and just stared...leading us into...
Dany and Dracarys was phenomenal. I don't like her character, but tonight Emilia Clarke impressed the hell out of me with her deliverance of the Valyrian speech.  The whole scene was great, especially Jorah's reaction. 
Great, great episode that is one of the best of the series so far.
113	Lord of Cheese	2013-04-22	...RIP Old Big Bear, he loves the honey. Well shot, intense, violent scene at Crasters. My show-only friends stopped what they were doing once Craster stood up, and just stared...leading us into......I wonder how many people realised that Jorah's father had just been killed up North beyond the Wall.
114	Words of Winter	2013-04-22	I gave it a 9.25.
Ep 1 --- 8+
Ep 2 --- 6
Ep 3 --- 9
Ep 4 --- 9.25
I just realized, there was no "HBO scene" in this one.  Maybe they will see they don't need create scenes for  T&A in every episode.

115	Fuse Prime	2013-04-22	I gave it an 8.  A very strong 8 at that.  I agree with other posters that while it was the best episode thus far, it wasn't up there with some of the other great episodes this show has had.  I especially enjoyed watching it with unsullied.  I loved their reactions from the death of the LC to Dany's Dracarys scene (been waiting for that for a looooong time).  The rest of the season should see more 8, 9, and possibly one giant 10 from me.
116	DanyStark	2013-04-22	Amazing of course but gave a 9 because wanted to feel the weight of the Old Bear's death more.
117	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2013-04-22	What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?
118	ohpooratlas	2013-04-22	Gave it a 10.DRACARYS.The High Valaryian just blew my mind away.  Seriously.  Emilia Clarke sounded fierce.  So. F'ing. Good.
119	Nezzer	2013-04-22	You know an episode was fantastic when you see it scoring a 10 from the majority of the members of Westeros.org. That's a very rare sight in these parts.
120	Lyanna Stark-Baratheon	2013-04-22	4 Words....."I LOVE RAMSEY SNOW!!!"He is what made ASOS my favorite book; and Now my favorite. thought  they was gon have the  "mystery dark haired savior"(Ramsey Snow unbeknownst to Theon.) sub for Kiera I WAS SO RIGHT!!! .BEST SCENE EVER!!!! .REEK I have been waiting for you!!!Ps. I LOVE HOW THEY GAVE LYANNA HER "PROMISE ME" LINE TO CAT!!!
121	Alboin	2013-04-22	I guess I'm a little less enthusiastic as a majority of people this time...
- Dany final scene was indeed truly brilliant, perfectly staged, fantastic acting by Clarke, Djavadi score is beyond expectations, camera, CGI - everything is the best motion picture quality. Never seen anything like that on television.
- Tywin/Cersei scene is moving and tells a lot about both characters.
- Jaime and Brienne reflections on what has happened in the previous episiode touched me
- Mormont's failed attempt to spit on Rast almost put tears on my face, and Rast himself so easily hateable, great job.
- Theon's monologue was one of the best moments for the character and the actor since season 2
(-)
- I didn't like how coup at Craster's Keep was handled in general. I think they were aiming at "chaos" which is it, but for a scene to work as a chaos we have to understand who is who and what they want beforehand. Otherwise it's just a montage of screams and swords and corpses. In other words - they had to build some ground for something like that, don't just pull plotters as rabbits out of the hat.
- BWB scene wasn't that remarkable for me as it was in the book. Maybe because Beric didn't look like a walking corpse as I imagined but rather as a noble pirate /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> Maybe because the whole thing was staged rather neutral, where in my head it was always something fierce and pagan and very wild.
- Sorcerer in a box. Is this going somewhere or just another stupid joke like Pod's sexual performance?
- Sophie Turner happy moment was acted way worse then her frustrations.
- Bran's dream... Uhm, what? Cat doesn't let Bran get to three-eyed-crow? How come?
Gave it a 7

122	Arrogant Bastard	2013-04-22	I give it a very solid 9.
--Great ending, captured the scene from the book as well as could be done, though just like the book, I imagine a lot of people saw this moment coming a mile away
--Liked the Jaime Brienne stuff; toned down from the book, but still effective
--Enjoyed the Varys story, though I wish Tyrion showed a little sympathy to Varys as he does in the books. Great acting by Conleth Hill, though I do agree the segway into that scene didn't feel right
--Great added scene between Tywin and Cersei. Loved how it mirrored his talk with Tyrion, and shows that Tywin also treats her pretty shitty as well
--Good introduction of Beric, though I feel this might have been better suited to have the duel in the same episode; this bit might have been better next episode
Only things I really didn't care for was the continuation of Pod the sex god, even with just Varys speculating about it--I doubt he would give two shits about Podrick. Just pretty lame.
123	Eira Seren	2013-04-22	my only complaint is the conversation between Ros and Varys.  i guess we need some way to convey Lord Twatbeard's plans for Sansa, but they're overthickening that plot, it just seems so painfully obvious, especially after Varys and the Queen of Thorns already discuss it.  And would Varys really miss that little detail about the beds and need Ros to point it out to him?  please.
The rest of the show was fantastic, the Lord Commander's death was cut a little short, but the sept of Baylor looked great.  loved the Queen of Thorns, as always, and when Marjory and Joffrey stepped out of the sept together it reminded me of the Royal Family stepping out to cheering crowds at Buckingham Palace.  there's the moment where Joff just gets a little drunk on that power and Cersei realizes she's really lost him. . . and the look on Cersei's face when her father told her she isn't too smart and has no control over Joff. . .   really glad to see Dondarrion, he and the Hound play well off each other.
and, of course, the moment where Dany made her deal, handed over the dragon, and my dad, who doesn't read the books said, 'this isn't going to be pretty.'  might have to watch the end again so can see those dragons flying over her new army.

124	Loras	2013-04-22	I gave this episode a 10.
Alex Graves' direction was just phenomenal in this episode.  From the framing of the shots in the tunnel to the beautiful cave shots.  I was just so impressed.
Alfie Allen was a standout for me in this episode. I really enjoyed him relating the story of what actually happened at Winterfell.  His performance was incredibly raw and moving.
Also a shout out to Gwendoline Christie.  She was a revelation in this episode.  
I actually rather enjoyed the Ros/Varys scene.  
So much to like in this episode.  I could have done without the shovelling shit section.  I am also pleasantly surprised by how little Littlefinger there has been so far this season.
125	Griff too	2013-04-22	I must say I loved this episode. I feel the fact and D&D wrote this one as well, made this one and last week's flow very well together. The Bran scene definitely stood out as a odd timed and not very well executed scene in my personal opinion. I love Bran's storyline in the books and i hope that over the next few episodes we really start to see his arc explored more. The Jaime/Brienne interactions continue to be a huge plus of this season. They are really developing those two characters well. (I think now, just as in the books, we begin to see Jamie's turn from a "bad guy" to a soon to be hero)
I'm such a fan of the Theon storyline. I know it's not from the books exactly but GRRM has had to help give his ideas towards this arc and I appreciate the character development for his character as well.
The NW mutiny was a little chaotic but I really think we have not seen the true end of that and maybe somehow they will still get the Old Bear's last words into the show.
I personally had chills starting from when Beric started to talk til the end of the episode. What a way to finish the show and I just can't wait to see what is still to come. 10!
126	Mendoza	2013-04-22	Definitely the best episode of the season.
127	TomBadgerlock	2013-04-22	Awesome. 10/10.
The Astapor scene was just phenomenal. I don't think I've seen a better scene in television than that. Emilia Clarke has absolutely blown me away. The emotion she got through screaming in Valyrian...fucking hell. I knew she was talented but that was more than I ever expected.
Loved all the scenes with Varys. Especially with Ros and Olenna. Could have done without the Tyrion one. Tyrion is feeling a bit like a passenger so far this season.

128	Wankerfell	2013-04-22	Excellent! One of the best episodes of the entire series. A television show isn't just about dialogue and events; it's also about pacing, which at times the show struggles with, hopping from scene to scene and character to character so quickly and abruptly that moments either aren't given a chance to land, or they're upon us too quickly for us to invest. But this episode was paced perfectly, allowing every scene to develop naturally, and making 50 minutes feel almost feature-length.
I especially enjoyed Joff and Margaery in the sept, the little psychopathic king gleefully recounting the most gruesome deaths to befall past Targaryen royals. The show has made no secret of the Tyrells' motives, yet Margaery's obvious pandering to King Joff still comes across as sincere.
The climactic scene at Craster's keep was well-done, but it's also where I lodge my one and only complaint about tonight's episode: We are never given the impression that mutiny is near. Our first hint that the crows aren't happy comes from Rast during the poo-shoveling scene, but he's always been a negative Nancy, so his vague threat isn't really a good indicator of dissent within the party. Needless to say, it's a bit jarring when factions are already formed and fighting as Sam slips out.
But that's really a minor nitpick. The episode overall was tremendous. Beric Dondarrion was excellent, and though I sympathized with the Dog when he felt like he was being punished for sharing his brother's surname, Arya's objection to his claims of innocence was an awesome reminder of just how effed up of a person he really is. Forget Jaime, is there a character more gray than Sandor Clegane?
Of course, I can't end this without mentioning how sorely I missed seeing Jon and the wildlings, and Robb and the Tullys. These omissions are not flaws in the episode per se, but I must be critical of how little of the northmen we've seen outside of the crows. Mance is portrayed by a brilliant actor--maybe the best actor the show has cast to date--and he's had about three minutes of screen time this season. I suppose that will change as the season--this one and next--progresses, but it's a huge disappointment that so many great characters and actors are getting so little attention. I still say ten episodes isn't enough.
EDIT: I just realized I failed to mention the closing scene with Dany, the dragon, and the Unsullied. Do I even need to? It was ridiculously phenomenal.

129	Juliads	2013-04-22	First time i've given any episode of season three a ten!  Really all the episodes so far have been a 7 and beyond to me, but tonight's episode was thoroughly enjoyable and left me craving for so much more.  Sunday couldn't get here soon enough.
The good-
I wasn't counting, but it seemed like we saw many different characters tonight, but the episode as a whole flowed well and didn't feel disjointed or rushed. They've had a problem with that in the past, in my pov.  Not tonight.  It was one satisfying ride.
I like Cersei, i know i shouldn't, she's been a horrible and cruel person but i find her struggle to maintain control over her life to be very fascinating and I really sympathize with her character.
Marg was great with Joff, but i'm patiently waiting for the purple wedding and not getting too caught up in any of their scenes together.  Her moment with Sansa was excellent.  Sophie Turner is brilliant.  Her reaction to the friendship line and a marriage/way out of KL was so so so sad to watch. Poor child.
Jamie is quickly becoming one of my top favorite characters. When he reached for his sword with his stump i physically flinched.  Very well done, very realistic. I can't wait to see more.
The Hound/Arya/BWB moment was also great.  I've always loved the Hound from the books, and I am curious to see how much of the canon hound we will (finally /rolleyes.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' /> ) get to see. I'm impressed with the actor the more I see of him.  Not a huge moment for Arya, a small speech about Micah, nothing to memorable for me personally.
I'm surprised to say this,but I really did enjoy Dany in the last clip.  To me, her acting has been pretty rotten since season one, but I found her delivery and performance quite chilling and believable.  More of that Dany please!
Theon was awesome.  It was very well done how the "Boy" tricked him back into his cell.  I love Alfie Allen, excellent actor.  He's made me sympathize for Theon more than i ever did in the books.
The not so good
Nights watch fight could have been built up more.  Someone else pointed out that Theon should have been limping, cradling his finger, or at least expressing some pain from having his fingernail removed.  I have to agree, he seemed fine to me in tonight's clip.
Enough of Tyrion, lets give him a break.  It's starting to feel desperate to include him in every episode.  I hate the notion of a "lead" character in such a massive, diverse plot as this. Let another character/actor shine through, especially when Tyrion's presence isn't even needed.

130	Juliads	2013-04-22	... though I sympathized with the Dog when he felt like he was being punished for sharing his brother's surname, Arya's objection to his claims of innocence was an awesome reminder of just how effed up of a person he really is. Forget Jaime, is there a character more gray than Sandor Clegane?I loved his response to that. Something along the lines of "I should have killed you then"  Sandor Clegane is certainly a badass, and truly one of the grayest characters created, in my pov.
131	teemo	2013-04-22	A lot of viewers don't know/completely forgot that Jeor is Jorah's father, so his last words were a missed opportunity imo.  If they timed it right they could have cut straight to Jorah's face after to emphasize it.

If they timed it right they could have cut straight to Jorah's face after to emphasize it.That's exactly what I had in mind. It's a damn shame the show didn't give the Old Bear a good farewell.
133	TheWhiteRabbit	2013-04-22	I went to the Thunder game tonight (NBA playoffs) so I just finished the episode. I'm going to have to watch it again because I don't know how I really feel about it right now. The two iconic scenes that I thought would make this episode epic (Craster's and Astrapor sacking) seemed very underwhelming. Honestly, I feel a little let down right now. Maybe I just need to watch it again.
134	Queen of Whores	2013-04-22	I gave it a solid 8. This wasn't even my favorite episode of this season. 'Dark Wings, Dark Words' gets that title. I honestly expected more from Dany's scene, from what everyone had said, and the mutiny felt rushed and chaotic, and not in the way it was in the book. It really lacked the emotion as well.
Yet again Tyrion is on screen for the sake of being onscreen. Varys' monologue was expressed very differently from what I imagined. I also disliked his scene with Ros and that the Tyrell marriage alliance didn't come from the Tyrells themself. Joffrey is being tamed down a bit too much I think.
Bran's scene was incredibly pointless and didn't need to be in the episode. Theon's scene was alright, and his line about Ned being his real father was sad. Ramsay's face was pure Ramsay. 
Funny enough what I enjoyed the most in the episode were the small details. I loved Jaime's hand being around his neck, and drinking the horse piss. It's always nice when they just stick to the book. And even though the scene was a little too long, I enjoyed hearing more Westerosi history in Joffrey's scene. The sept of Baelor looks very nice.
I feel indifferent to Arya's scene, mostly because she's been so underplayed this season. I'm honestly more excited for the dual next episode than I was for the Dracarys scene. 
So I didn't dislike the episode, but I felt it was overrated by many people. And as for it being the best episode of the series, I enjoyed nearly every season 1 episode more than this one. Blackwater was just 'meh' for me. Hopefully judging by events that will transpire next episode I will like that one more.
135	brAnthelAstgreenseer	2013-04-22	Most of the people here are saying Bran's scene was pointless.I think it was made pointless by some bad editing,they needed to explain more about whats going on there.
Theon/Ramsay was again great.
Dany scenes were amazing but because of the budget they could not show more.
Excellent episode.
136	Watcher_inthe_Woods	2013-04-22	I loved this one...gave it a 10. This was the first this season that I didn't have really major head explosions...lol....and darn it if I didn't start liking Dany for a sec there.
137	Moseh Khayim	2013-04-22	A big fat 9.
Really nothing that I didn't like. Even the less important scenes like the one with Joffrey and Margaery were very pleasant, thanks to the beautiful architecture and interesting Targaryen backstory.
The acting overall was superb: NCW, Christie, McCann, Rigg(!). Even Clarke delivered. Delivered in Valyrian, which she should always do from now on. Adds to the badassery.
I've waited 3 episodes. But now, like the great philosopher Shang Tsung once said: IT HAS BEGUN!
138	greywindsrage	2013-04-22	DANY SCENE ROCKED!!!!!!!
139	greywindsrage	2013-04-22	I like how we get to seeTheon suffer mentally emotionally. Ramsay is a real bastard.

140	greywindsrage	2013-04-22	Tywin/Cersei scene was fantastic. Varys story was another great scene. Jaime's humiliation makes any of his haters feel some sympathy for him.
141	Mr Hodor	2013-04-22	Wonderful. 9.
Loved dracarys and crasters keep, they were almost to the book.
Not sure about the captive wizard or varys actively working against LF.
But the best scene according to me was tywin educating cersei
142	PatrickStormborn	2013-04-22	9/10
It was brilliant - particularly the Dany scene. But the fact she didn't whip Kraznys in the face with his own whip was a little bit disappointing. I've imagined that scene so many times that my expectations were way too high to be matched, so I didn't detract a mark for this. It would have been nice to see the other two dragons in Astapor too.
The King's Landing scenes were mostly great this episode (apart from what I've outlined below). Tyrion/Varys, the scene in the Sept of Baelor, Tywin/Cersei, Varys/Olenna, and Sansa/Margaery were all fantastic. Joffrey talking about the history of the Targaryens in the Sept was a great and believable way to convey some of the history.
My main problems with the episode were: the sorceror in the box, a few bits of dialogue that felt off (particularly the "You sound like a bloody woman" line from Brienne to Jaime), Catelyn being blamed for holding Bran back (is she blamed for EVERYTHING in this show?), and the Pod/whores joke.

144	reeser	2013-04-22	It was a 8 or 9 even before the end, the Daenerys scene that we all knew was coming kicked it over the 10 mark /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /> It was probably one of the few times that a anticipated scene from a book lived up to it in every way and actually surpasses it because of amazing visuals and music during it. The sheer look on her face as she is commanding the Unsullied and then turning and finally uttering "dracarys!" is something I can watch over and over even years from now. All around it was a great ep its just those final minutes were about as memorable as you can get as far scenes go.
145	Conor	2013-04-22	Gave it a 10. It was the first time I was engrossed from beginning to end.
The ending was spectacular. Hopefully they will be able to breathe some life into Dany's future story.
146	The Mondrian Oak	2013-04-22	Utter perfection. 10/10. Everything in this show wraps up perfectly, and the internal referencies are driving me insane. Tywin saying "you are not as smart as you think you are", in line with Cersei's "you are not half as clever as you think you are" to Tyrion; Locke's "fancy word for a fancy man" last week, perfectly matching with the "fancy word for a sellsword/been spending time with fancy folks" exchange between Tyrion and Bronn back in season two. And there are hundreds of other examples. Perfection,9/10It was brilliant - particularly the Dany scene.

FIFTEEN. I mean, come on.
147	PatrickStormborn	2013-04-22	Well Cat did make Bran promise that he wont climb again.I think Bran was just remembering that. It still makes me uncomfortable when we consider that Catelyn was right. And yet in the show she's blamed for everything that happened to her family. Mate, the Pod joke took something like fifteen seconds. FIFTEEN. I mean, come on. So? It was 15 seconds of stupidity that pulled me straight out of the episode and reminded me who D&D's target audience are: dudebros. Prostitutes do not turn down money. They don't have sex for enjoyment. Therefore the joke was stupid.

The very same thing happened in ancient Rome. So, prostitutes used to and still do that.
149	paul1ca	2013-04-22	Amazing episode,ever since I read the chapter with Dany/Unsullied scene I couldn't wait to see it,and it was exactly how I pictured it would be.Simply amazing.
150	Holdfast	2013-04-22	8/10. Far and away best part was Dany's Astapor scene - every part of it just amazing from beginning to end (and I'm not even a Dany fan).
Would have given it more but didn't like the Varys/Ros scene and am over the whole Podrick thing.  Also didn't see the fit of Bran's scene in this episode.  Overall a great episode.
151	reeser	2013-04-22	a ten..... when dany spoke valyrian i was shaking from how powerful that scene was.	 she reminded me of aegon the conquerorHehe really gotta wonder if ruling, conquering etc is just truly in the Targaryen bloodline that if they dont go bat crazy they are simply born to rule. Every Targaryen down the line that was feared/respected had that aura, they didnt climb mountains...mountains got out of their way. Daenerys has shown evidence of that (talking tv series since we know the books) and finally cemented it with this episode. I mean I think from tv format pov that it was such a strong scene that the (no spoiler) other thing down the line might just overly complicate it in this medium. You dont have Alexander the Great and then pop in a young upstart Julius Caesar going hey lets conquer the world together! With novels you can do it since you can go on forever in details and explaining it...bit tougher for tv.
152	Ran	2013-04-22	After 320 votes, this episode is rating a 9.21 of 10. Quite impressive.The Mondrian,I sadly know (not by personal experience, of course) of prostitutes having "favourite" and "recurring" clients, to whom they sometimes give "free services". The very same thing happened in ancient Rome. So, prostitutes used to and still do that.Indeed. But as you note, that's for recurring clients, where the free services are part of what is, essentially, a business strategy to retain their custom.I'm fairly certain that never in the history of the world have three prostitutes given away their services to a virgin because he was so amazing in bed.
153	R'hllor Skates	2013-04-22	As a hardcore fan of the books, I felt the first three episodes were rather dissapointing. But not this episode. First 10 of the season for me.
154	reeser	2013-04-22	I guess I'm a little less enthusiastic as a majority of people this time...- Dany final scene was indeed truly brilliant, perfectly staged, fantastic acting by Clarke, Djavadi score is beyond expectations, camera, CGI - everything is the best motion picture quality. Never seen anything like that on television.- Tywin/Cersei scene is moving and tells a lot about both characters.- Jaime and Brienne reflections on what has happened in the previous episiode touched me- Mormont's failed attempt to spit on Rast almost put tears on my face, and Rast himself so easily hateable, great job.- Theon's monologue was one of the best moments for the character and the actor since season 2Hehe yeah you actually feel SORRY for Theon for a moment til a second later when you are laughing at him the moment that torch lights up the room and he realizes. I wonder if Martin was tormented or bullied by someone named Theon as a child /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
155	Joyful Union	2013-04-22	Is it impossible that there's something more to the Pod thing? I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt, until I've seen the rest of season.
156	The Mondrian Oak	2013-04-22	The Mondrian,Indeed. But as you note, that's for recurring clients, where the free services are part of what is, essentially, a business strategy to retain their custom.I'm fairly certain that never in the history of the world have three prostitutes given away their services to a virgin because he was so amazing in bed.Yes, you are right. It surely is hard to believe, if one thinks about it carefully. But I think this whole "Podrick the sex beast" thing is aimed at cementing Pod into the memory of the audience, as his role will become more important (even though not THAT important, for what we readers know) in the future. I mean, hadn't that scene happened, people might have needed to be reminded who Pod actually is; the answer would of course have been "the lad who saved Tyrion in Blackwater". But now people, when hearing Pod's name, will immediatly know who he is. The trick used wan nontheless cheap at the very least, I totally agree.

158	Mediumjon Umber	2013-04-22	Easily the best episode since s01e09. Blackwater was awesome, but it was mostly just flash and bang. This was a well-rounded episode that began where it should and ended as it should. Dany was freaking amazing at the end.
I only wish we'd gotten to see more of the sack of Astapor /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
159	PatrickStormborn	2013-04-22	I didn't pick up on this when I watched the episode, but Theon saying his "real father lost his head in King's Landing" is out of character and a bit cringeworthy in all honesty. Theon saw Robb as a brother, but Ned was NEVER a father figure towards him. He couldn't be; he knew one day he may have had to execute him.
160	Uncia	2013-04-22	The first time that i gave a 10/10
161	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	I didn't pick up on this when I watched the episode, but Theon saying his "real father lost his head in King's Landing" is out of character and a bit cringeworthy in all honesty.

It was a bit like Cat and Jon all over again, although the rest of the monologue was good.Nobody else seems to have mentioned it here, but props to the actor playing Craster. He really did make the character very easy to hate.
162	Sir Noone Sword Of The Day	2013-04-22	Great episode, but doesn't Sansa realize that she can't marry Loras, because he is in the Kingsguard??
163	PatrickStormborn	2013-04-22	Great episode, but doesn't Sansa realize that she can't marry Loras, because he is in the Kingsguard??He's not in the Kingsguard.
164	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	Great episode, but doesn't Sansa realize that she can't marry Loras, because he is in the Kingsguard??He's not in the KG just yet, but I have a feeling Tywin will make him join it when he learns of the plot. It would be an interesting parallel between Tywin and Aerys.
165	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-22	I had to give it a 10, there's nothing really substantial for me to complain about. It's the best episode we've had in a while, perhaps the best episode so far? Together with the launch of Season 2 of Continuum, this makes me a happy man (I know this makes me sound like a TV junkie, these are the only shows I watch though /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />).No pointless brothel scenes, no "here's Tyrion and Bronnmance just because we want to show him", no moping Jon Snow, great action, drama, and I still got a fair share of laughs. This episode delivered the kind of dark and sarcastic humour (Eddisson Tollet!) you expect from the show rather than the forced teenage boy humour from last episode.The scheming was there, and I think it was done in a way people could figure out what's going on. It really helps the episode to allow their best actors to shine. Charles Dance was amazing ("You're not as smart as you think you are!"), Jack Gleeson is just hilariously good at depicting Joffrey as the little shit he is ("here's some tales about death and destruction, love me! Let's be a beautiful sociopathic couple!" and of course his waving like a douche), Dianna Rigg had some great lines about how ridiculous the Tyrell sigil and words is, something I've been saying for years!, Rory McCann as the flawless Hound who is still able to intimidate everyone even when he's in ropes, and Conlyth deserves awards, too...Whoever played the guy who killed Craster did a great job, as well as Rast. These are small roles, but oh so important, and for young actors they did really well holding their own among legends like James Cosmo and Robert Pugh.Sansa had a very nice scene. Sophie Turner really captured the mixture of happiness and despair Sansa also felt in the books when the offer was made to go to Highgarden and Nathalie Dormer stills plays Margaery as just fake and clever enough for me to still see through her as I did in the books.A hint that Varys can actually be a cruel man too is a nice touch. And it makes sense he'd get his revenge given the power he has.A lot of the details were also right. The second of bromance between Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan, while perhaps out of place, was a nice touch which in one shot reminds us of their earlier discussions and how Daenerys has found a solution for both.The Unsullied are awesome. The beating of the spears seemed like a nod towards the Uruk Hai in the Two Towers, I'm probably not the only one who was reminded of that.Here's to hoping every episode from now on can hold up this standard.Finally, I don't get how people can still be criticizing Emilia Clarke. That girl is badass, her acting during that ending scene gave me goosebumps.PS RIP Jeor Mormont, James Cosmo, it was good to have you on the show, you will be missed /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' /> I would've preferred him to snap Rast's neck and go out like a badass, alas, it was not to be.

But again, yes, the whole thing was a cheap trick.
170	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-22	I figure that's gonna happen when all the wights attack him and gilly, maybe in the show they will have them be joined by a other or 2.I'm strangely enticed by the idea of watching Sam slash through a horde of them with nothing but a small dragonglass knife, screaming like a madman and covered in blood, rather than just killing one...How they will do it, well my guess would be that he kills the Other and then finds himself surrounded by wights just after he killed it to ruin the moment, and then Coldhands shows up and still manages to save the day. Eh, he might get some help from Ed and Grenn too because they have to live but I didn't see them coming with him just yet.

Either way, they're probably not cheap.One more thing I wanted to say was that I like how the episode's title was made in honour of Jeor Mormont while it could've been called 'Dracarys' or so many other things. He was one of my favourite characters on book as well as show.I also forgot to mention Iwan Rheon is great as Ramsay - the madness in his face when he reveals he's betrayed Theon was spot on. I don't entirely get how Theon didn't see they were travelling in the wrong direction, but oh well. But please, no more torture scenes! Oh well, who am I talking to, Theon still has to get castrated... oh boy :/The only nitpick I have is Brienne's 'You sound like a bloody woman!' It would be okay for anyone but her to say this, she, who respected Catelyn's strength and is possibly the walking embodiment of feminism on the show... at least, she should be.

174	brAnthelAstgreenseer	2013-04-22	I didn't pick up on this when I watched the episode, but Theon saying his "real father lost his head in King's Landing" is out of character and a bit cringeworthy in all honesty. Theon saw Robb as a brother, but Ned was NEVER a father figure towards him. He couldn't be; he knew one day he may have had to execute him.Well i thought that was keeping in line with the books.But this realisation does not come so early in the books.He says to Lady Dustin he was like one of the Stark kids and i think thats what D&D have implied on when writing that scene.
175	TehCount	2013-04-22	10 best episode since Blackwater imoAgreed
176	LordWymantheWide	2013-04-22	I really liked the episode but I thought Mormont's death scene (complaint of mine overall with the show) lacked size and scope. I felt it should have been bigger. This was the end of the Nights Watch north of the wall and it came across as awkward. 
The Dany scenes had appropriate feeling but seeing the Old Bear die lacked a bit of urgency.
177	PatrickStormborn	2013-04-22	Well i thought that was keeping in line with the books.But this realisation does not come so early in the books.He says to Lady Dustin he was like one of the Stark kids and i think thats what D&D have implied on when writing that scene. He would never view Ned as his father though, because Ned did not treat him like a son.
178	Roose Seal	2013-04-22	^It's not outside of the realm of possibilities. Abused children (which Theon sort of was) often love their parents much more than they love them. It's entirely possible that Ned tried his hardest to never be a true father to Theon but Theon still yearned for his approval and loved him like a real father. It totally makes sense to me.
10 all around: Best episode of the season for me. All the storylines clicked. This season is so much better than S2 so far.

179	brAnthelAstgreenseer	2013-04-22	He would never view Ned as his father though, because Ned did not treat him like a son.I think D&D have implied that if he wants to be one of the stark kids then automatically he wants to be Ned's son.
180	Mexal	2013-04-22	I think D&D have implied that if he wants to be one of the stark kids then automatically he wants to be Ned's son.That's how I took it as well and really, I don't have an issue with it. It makes Theon's fall heartbreaking, him knowing he made the wrong decision, especially as he's spilling his feelings right before being betrayed. We never see this in the books but I think it fits perfectly with the Theon we have seen on screen.
181	The Anti-Targ	2013-04-22	Great Episode. My only real gripe is Theon fessing up about not killing Bran and Rickon. The rest of it was damned solid.

183	TheEvilKing	2013-04-22	Gave it a 10. Was on track for an 8 but the Astapor sequence was phenomenal.
184	Stannis the Menace	2013-04-22	def 10
The only thing that i thought they missed was when the Unsullied start chanting "Dracarys, Dracarys, Dracarys!" during the sacking
185	Serr Parker	2013-04-22	9. Absolutely amazing, wish there was some Stannis on there but everything was brilliant wouldn't have changed a thing
186	Tywin's Honour	2013-04-22	9/10, bordering on a flawless 10/10
 - Jamie and Brienne's amazing chemistry continues
- The subtle manipulation of Joffrey by Margaery was well executed.
- NW scene was exactly how I envisioned it
- Astapor... need I say more? I actually got out of my seat when Dany asked "Is it done?". Liked the butting of the spears, too.
- Pod is indeed the proverbial stud. Sure, why not.
- QoT excellent as per usual. Good interaction with Varys.
- Even though Dondarrion was not how I pictured him aesthetically, he possessed a certain charisma and presence. Unlike Mance...
- Only downside was the continued evolution of Ros. The woman is portrayed as more of a Player than many of the protagonists. Intelligence and cunning on par or superior to that of Varys? Utter nonsense.

188	Sun	2013-04-22	I give it a 9. Best episode since Baelor in season 1. I have no complaints.

189	Tywin's bastard	2013-04-22	An amazing episode. 
Dany's scene was the crown jewel and really did justice to that very important event. This was her finest moment of strength in the show.
The story of Jaime and Brienne keeps being so well acted and they did a great job playing out the aftermath of the last episode.
The NW story was done very well. All the misery finally led up to it's own destruction.
The Brotherhood Without Banners keeps being an awesome band of vigilantes and Beric Dondarrion managed to be appropriately lordly while still fitting in with the rest.
The scheming of King's Landing keeps being played out well. The women were the big players, but also great to see lots of Varys again and no one can match the presence of Tywin.
190	Jamie Lannister	2013-04-22	A solid 9. A little bit slow every now and then, but some great scenes both anticipated and invented.
191	Dracarya	2013-04-22	I don't recall the last time I gave an episode a 10, but this most definitely deserved it. They have really turned things around for season 3. That final Dany scene was amazing, absolutely fantastic, and the scene at Craster's was done equally well. Everything about this season seems extremely strong, including the deviations, and the episodes just keep getting better and better. Brilliant, I'm very pleasantly surprised.
192	Chuck88	2013-04-22	Gave it a 9 but on second viewing it probably should have been a 10
Best Dany scene of the entire series - easily. I loved everything about it - the Valyrian, 'Dracarys' and especially the look between Barristan and Jorah when the unsullied are banging their spears. Just perfect TV and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.
There he is - Good to see our first real glimpse of Ramsay. I can't imagine many will still feel he is too 'cute' for the role. Dem eyes.
Heavy KL episode, and almost all of it was excellent. I'm not thrilled about Pod being turned into a sex god but I'm hardly going to lose sleep over it.
The mutiny /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' /> The guy that plays Craster has gotta be one of the most underrated actors on the show. Definitely in the love to hate category.
I seriously hope Rast gets ripped the shreds by a white walker or something. Horrible little p***k.
Other little things,
Nice introduction to Beric.
Impossible not to feel for Jaime now. NCW continues to be the standout actor of this season so far.
The sorcerer was a nice touch.
LOL at Joffrey's line about the dragon eating someone.
Locke is one f****d up dude.
Side note. There is barely any nudity this season. Weird.
193	Srefanius	2013-04-22	Easily one of the best episodes of the whole show, Dany... just WOW!
10/10
194	Sansa in the North	2013-04-22	The scene with Cat pushing Bran out of a tree was odd. Everything else was perfect! The Dracarys scene and Marge/QoT/Varys scenes especially were everything I wanted and more. I also loved the Tywin/Cersei conversation, it was epic. I gave this episode a 10. First 10 this season.
195	Bajaz	2013-04-22	10,it was the best episode so far.
196	Fred Stark	2013-04-22	I dont know why  nobody mentioned Theon's confession scene..'My father lost his head in Kings Landing'..that was really a moving scene..LOved all the other scenes especially Margaery-Sansa -Queen of Thorns-Varys scene..and Dany's scene was great..just perfect..While i didnt like Bran's dream scene ,I appreciate we get to see Michelle Fairley..I hope there is a  dream scenes of the Starks..maybe all of them together...or just a scene with Catelyn crying in the river

197	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-04-22	Dracarys!!!
Awesome! Loved it!
198	mystikherb	2013-04-22	If I really think about it, I might say this episode was a 9 or 9.5. The reason I would not go for a 10 is because every episode of any show could be improved by my tastes in some small way.  Here's what I will say.
This episode is the best one so far this season by a mile.  I will also say that it is definitely a contender for my favorite episode of the entire series so far, if it hasn't already won that honor.  When I think about that ending...
Dracarys.
Fuck it. 10.
199	Olympia	2013-04-22	10
- laughed maniacally when Margaery proceeded with her "wrap Joffrey around my pretty finger" antics and told him to come see his people
- smiled and got really teary eyed upon seeing Sansa's happy face
- shook my head when the mutiny happened. Oh boy the Night's Watch is definitely made of rotten stuff now.
- THE ENDING WAS AWESOME. I momentarily forgot that I was irritated with Dany just because the whole Astapor scene was so. bad. ass.
- laughed maniacally (again) during Varys and Ros' gossip session
- although Dany had the "big" scene, Varys owned this episode.
200	Garlan Marius	2013-04-22	I give this episode a 10, unabashedly.  There's literally nothing I'm willing to complain about on this one.
201	StarkDragon	2013-04-22	Best Episode of the Season easily.
202	A Redeemed Hound	2013-04-22	I give it a 9.  Amazing episode.  Dany was perfection.  RIP Old Bear.  That scene was tense as hell and quite sad.  Love Arya standing up to the Hound.  Next week should be another great episode.  The music was fantastic too.  Gave me goosebumps.  Big props to the special effects now that we can see things on grander scales.  Kings Landing looks amazing.  Enjoyed the scenes with Queen of Thorns a lot.  Okay with the change to Sansa and Loras.  Not a big deal and makes more sense for TV.  Jaime's hand was gross as hell and his scenes with Brienne are awesome.  Brienne is simply a great actress.  Hell they all are.  Tywin/Cersie was superb.  The one thing that I did not care for was Varys and the wizard in the box.  I get it was to show he is nobody do cross but still.  Also weak was the Bran scene.  I think it's just going to be hard to tell his story since he really does just wander around most of the books.  I hope they really do a great scene with him at that old castle in the water up north during the storm with Hodor and seeing Ghost and helping Jon escape.  Forget the name of the place.  Queens something or other right?

203	Gannicus	2013-04-22	No doubt the best episode of the season. 9/10 for me.
204	A Redeemed Hound	2013-04-22	And Theon's character is awesome.  Knowing how much he is in for is killing me.  Great acting all around with him.  This is going to be the season where GOT wins every Emmy.  It's a wonderful season.
205	Jussi	2013-04-22	One of the best episodes of the series.
10/10
206	Juli Cachet	2013-04-22	Gave it a 10, perfect.
Loved the mutiny at Craster's Keep, Margaery's scenes and most of all Theon and Ramsay.
I'm not a fan of Dany, even less show-Dany, but Dracarys was the first scene I really liked her in.
And Valyrian just sounds badass. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
207	Ser Drizztos	2013-04-22	Bloody awesome episode, maybe the best one to date, so full 10/10 from me.
I've nothing to complain about. No meaningless or boring filler. The final scene with Daenerys gave me goosebumps. I've complained a lot about her acting before, but she gave a great performance this time around.
208	Nomad/	2013-04-22	Best epsiode so far.
but it was hard to see the Old Bear die
209	MysteryNinja	2013-04-22	9/10
So many memorable scenes!
I don't have any particular gripes, except maybe the continuation of Pod & the whores (but it was short so I can live with it) and the fact that Brienne accused Jaime of acting like "a bloody woman" for whining and wanting to quit - that made me frown /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />  but both these things were just small irritations in between the good to great to awesome scenes of this episode.
210	Little Wing	2013-04-22	10/10Dany scene - amazing. I actually teared up a bit...Varys and his background. Varys/Lady Ollena. <3 <3 <3Cersei/Tywin!Beric!!!!!! You killed Mycah!!!Ramsay!Craster's wasn't as awful as it was in my head, but still, they did an okay job.Poor Jaime....The whole episode was amazing. I felt as if I was watching a movie...   *.*
211	sati	2013-04-22	For me it was 9,4/10 - no stupid brothel scenes, no Robb acting dumb, no Jon, very little Sam and Bran. I'd add more points but Mormont's death was ridiculously rushed.  Great dialouge and character interactions that brought season 1 to mind. Other than Dracarys and Jaime my favorite things were yet another scene with Tywin writing a letter (so chilling!) and the look of Jorah's face when he realizes Dany planed it all along.
212	Sir Mark of the East	2013-04-22	Easy vote. 10/10. One of the best episodes. Damn Khaleesi! I enjoyed reading that part but man I enjoyed it even more watching it! It was perfect!
213	rumple9	2013-04-22	10 - best episode yet!
Varys scene with Tyrion gave me goosebumps - Varys was chilling and scary - great acting.
As for Astapor - perfect! And that army!
214	cybobbie	2013-04-22	Still enjoying the memories of the end of the episode! Simply awesome to be able to see one of the moments that I really loved in the books so well done in the screen, so a 10, for me. Not only Dany's moments were great, but we also had amazing scenes with Varys and Tyrion and Varys and the Queen of Thorns (her lines are great in the show) and Beric scenes. This ones are my highlights, but all the episode was great.
215	Sword of the Morning Wood	2013-04-22	10/10
Not saying it can't hasn't or won't be bettered but it deserves the 10.
Good
- The mutiny at Craster's. The tension in the scene was brilliant. Craster's bluster at being called a bastard and then the seeming calming down and suddenly "but you are a bastard". Bad.....ass! Haertbreaking to see the Old Bear killed by that shit Rast but great TV.
- Theon and "boy". I really like what they're doing with this part of the story. Theon's tear stained confession and admission that the Stark's were his real family and he betrayed them and burned everything good that he had was tough. And the full sadism of Ramsey dawning on everyone.
- The BwB. Great scene, McCann was excellent. He IS The Hound for me. Whoever said his might be the best performances of the show, I'd find it tough to disagree too much, he's up there with Dinklage and Dance for me. Dondarrion was excellent, much better than I even imagined he might be.
- Jamie and Brienne. Not too much happening but these continue to be great scenes. We see Jamie still has that fight in him but it's extinbuished only for Brienne to help light a bit of the spark again. 
- Loved the QoT again. Her scene with Varys was excellent. Nobody's made the Spider squirm like that before.
- Dracarys. What a scene that was!!! Did the book justice for me.Dany was utterly epic and the scene with her marching out of Astapor with her army and her dragons was fantastic, sent shivers down my spine. I loved catching glimpses of the looks on Jorah's and Barristan's faces. A mix of confusion, pride and awe.
OK
Some the K'sL scenes were't great but weren't bad. 
Bad
Bran. It might have been the first episode since Blackwater, for a long time with not one poor scene but I thought Bran's scene with yet another Jojen/3ec dream was rubbish. If they want to establish Brans's green dreaming ability and what the 3ec is, a simple conversation with Jojen would be much better. No need for a scene like that.
216	Alizard Pyre	2013-04-22	I voted 8 but after a little thinking, it deserved 9.
The things I "didn't" like:
- A little slow, many "plotting" scenes in a raw. Yes I do love Varys and Olenna and, yes, Ros was very nice on her scene. But there was a moment I thought: "Hm, more talking". Again, I enjoyed every bit of dialog but the pace was still a bit slow.
- The Hound's "trial": The charges seemed a bit far-fetched... If the Brotherhood wants to do justice then they need solid ground. I don't know if I'm making any sense but I felt the whole exchange between Sandor and Beric about his guilt to be a bit weird.
- I really liked Mormont and I thought his death was too blended in the general chaos. 
What I liked:
- Varys really has a nice part in that episode. I thought of all the people saying "too many characters, too many scenes too short par episode...". So now it seems we have more of each character, in turns. I like that, especially when we focus on the mysterious and dangerous Lord Varys.
His story and then his speech about revenge were really chilling. Tyrion feels like an immature child, asking for an immediate revenge. Varys' answer was a real lesson.
- I agree with everything said about Olenna.
- The NW scene and the Astapor scenes, the two high moments of the episode.
- The look on Sandor's face when Beric says he's the one to fight.
- "Never thought Bannen could smell so good." This sentence sums up the whole thing.
- Tywin prooves again that he's the boss and Cersei gets her share of bashing. Now that we heard the tough words, I'm looking forward to the tough Tywin action!
- The rising tension between Cersei and Jeoffrey is great.
- Varys and Olenna talking about Littlefinger... Finally someone wants to take him down. I just hope they'll be able to scratch him at least
217	darksellsword	2013-04-22	I gave it another 10. Im embarassed by my cheerleading but from start to finnish it was perfection.
The Daenerys scene was everything i had hoped for so epic.
Battle at crasters keep was great the guy that killed craster was brilliant.
The brother hood without banners confronting Sandor Clegane scene was very good, the new
Dondarrion gets top marks bc he looks and sounds as hard as nails, Sandor was spot on as usual
and if maisie Williams doesnt get any award nominations  this season for playing Arya it will be a crime.
I really like the fact they are doing so many Theon scenes because imo Alfie Allen is one of the best
actors in the show.  Tywin telling cersei what he thinks of her moment i liked that.
Tyrion and Varys scene was only second to Danys .When i seen he had that
guy in the box i couldnt help but laugh.The locke tormenting Jaime part , the poor guy
well then again im not a Jaime hater anyway.D&D sirs i take my hat of to you.
218	Arrow	2013-04-22	Brienne's reaction to jamie whining was just pefection... im so happy those two are helping eachother out.Absolutely! This is the best developing relationship in the series, IMO - D&D are doing it just right. Started out as enemies but are finding an attachment based on mutual respect and good qualities they discovered in each other along the way, that most people don't see in day-to-day interactions - those are the best friendships, of course, the ones where you see people at their worst and still something shines through, and the person becomes valued... good stuff.
219	Flayed Starkman	2013-04-22	A good solid 9.
If they had trimmed the Pod jokes and left Theon and Bran out, it would have been near perfect.
220	BlackTalon	2013-04-22	I gave it a 9 because I want to preserve the 10 for the episode with you-know-what.
Otherwise, a stunning episode. It began strong and just kept getting better. The cave scene was great (just lacked a few "bugger you"s) and the Sacking of Astapor was everything I had wanted it to be (except Dany didn't strike Kraznys with the Harpy whip), holy crap!!!
Certainly the best episode of this season and one of the best four or five episodes of the whole series.
221	Dragonblood Stormborn	2013-04-22	I think Emilia Clarke is perfect as Daenerys Targaryen, Daenerys Stormborn, , Mother of Dragons, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles/Chains, Queen of Meereen and Princess of Dragonstone. Ever since Dany learned how to use her sexuality to become equal to her beloved Khal Drogo, she has been a bit intense, for valid reasons. Emilia Clarke is doing a perfect job, (imEho) and I never think someone else should play the part. I only add this because there's been some criticism of her abilities as an actress to evoke the true essence of Dany.
222	Table8	2013-04-22	Just finished my third viewing.  I wonder if fans of this show get too blinded by their enthusiasm to effectively rate each episode.  Episode 3.3 was very mediocre IMO, which is contrary to the majority of reviewers.  I gave last week's episode a 5, and stand by it.  But this episode was absolutely incredible!  Action packed, well written, well acted - it had it all.  And unlike the prior 3 episodes from this season, the pacing was very good.  We saw virtually every character in this episode (sans Jon Snow), and despite all the content, nothing felt rushed.  Finally!
High points were everywhere.  Jaime's opening scene succeeded in getting the character some much needed sympathy.  The directors did a great job conveying the hopelessness of a man, always used to getting his way, completely powerless.  I wondered if the show runners were going to take a heavy handed approach to redefining Jaime as a hero.  Instead it seems to be thoughtfully portrayed.
And Dany....wow!  I wouldn't call myself a Dany hater, but I certainly am not a fan.  But this episode really showed power in the character.  This is the first time since season 1 where Dany was actually likable.  Never would have thought I'd see an episode where a Dany scene was the best part.
Not perfect though.  Disliked the way they handled Mormont's death.  The books gave a greater sense of loss as Mormont died on Sam's lap.  That scene was so theatrical in the book, I'm surprised they left it out -it was made for TV.
Gave it an 8, primarily because of my disappointment over the craster scene.  But if they did that scene better, then this would have gotten the highest score I allow myself to give out - a 9.  (fans on this site are too lenient giving out 10s.  10s should be reserved for truly special episodes).
Edited to clarify I gave last weeks episode a 5.  This one an eight.

223	BlueEyedCrow	2013-04-22	Besides the obvious (and amazing) wow moments.  I loved the scenes with background information like Joffrey telling Marg about the Targs and The Hound/Brotherhood scene.  One of the best episodes yet, in my opinion, 10/10!
224	BlueEyedCrow	2013-04-22	I also agree that they kinda blew over the NW mutiny.  And yes, I do agree that Mormont dying in SAm's lap would have been great TV...
225	Table8	2013-04-22	Another high point,
Theon: my real father lost his head at King's Landing.
Loved how they didn't use Ned's name in that monologue!  So powerful!
226	Snookson	2013-04-22	Apparently I am in the minority here. I thought it was a very average episode except for the ending. I gave it a 7.
I liked the scenes with Jaime and Brienne. I think NCW did an excellent job portraying Jaime's utter physical and emotional defeat. Really felt the beginning of the episode. Likewise, the ending was incredible. I don't think they could have nailed that scene any better. Dany's ruthlessness is finally starting to come out for the non-book reader crowd.
The overthrow of Mormont at Craster's home was not good. At all. I didn't really even feel any emotion from it. That scene should have (could have) been an episode closer. It was that dramatic in the books.
Also did not like the Sansa/Marg scene. Felt very forced.
BWB scene was all right. Did not picture Beric like he is in the show.
Marg/Joff scene was pretty good -- basically just continuing to show her manipulation and mischeviousness. I love how Cersei is getting usurped. Lena makes some great faces.
QoT/Varys was solid. On the other hand, Varys shipping this sorcerer in from the East was bogus. That sorcerer represents something very personal that happened to him. One of the few chinks in his armor, so to speak. He is a very private person in regards to himself (not the Varys/Spider character). I don't think he really would have risked having this dude shipped into the Red Keep. Weird.
Theon -- meh. Waiting for Ramsay to get freaky.
The whole Pod/Littlefinger/whores/Varys/Ros circle jerk thing is understandably getting to a point. It is just taking its sweet fucking time getting there at the sacrifice of other important things. Yes Littlefinger is up to shit. We know this. I personally loved Varys's comment about how Littlefinger may be the most dangerous man in Westeros though.
227	Snookson	2013-04-22	I also agree that most are way too lenient on their ratings. A "10" is a perfect episode. Absolutely perfect. Nothing can be critiqued. A "5" is not a bad rating. That is average. As the season progresses the viewers get blinded by their lust for more and give out ridiculous ratings.
228	SerArthurHeath	2013-04-22	9. Glorious. I was hoping for a few bits they omitted but so close to perfection it would be churlish to take more than 1 mark away
229	Pure Guava	2013-04-22	Ramsay....ugwehhere....sadasa....This tickled me so much I felt the need to register here just to let you know...and thank you for the morning lol.
230	DaveSnow House Stark	2013-04-22	I gave it an 8 and think that was pretty fair. Really enjoyed most scenes, Brans was a little slow, getting tired of the dreams with the three eyed crow. Think Jaime should not have eaten right then, maybe another scene of her goading him, seemed fake with him giving in so fast.
I really didn't think the NW scene was bad. I loved the, "but you are a bastard" line. Yeah, maybe the LC deserved a better death scene, but all in all it was well done.
Theon, great again. Great to see the side of him that realizes that he made a huge mistake, and have him reveal that Bran and Rickon are still alive. 2nd best line of the show, "My real father died at Kings Landing"
Dany. This was the scene that stole the show. The only way it could have been better was if the other dragons had swooped in and joined the charbroiling fun!
Definately my favorite show of the season.
231	podrick_payne45	2013-04-22	It was a great episode. Loved the scenes with the Hound and Beric. The scene with Dany was also very good. My only complaint would be that the scene at crasters felt a little rushed.
232	Fear	2013-04-22	I too, like everyone else, enjoyed Daenerys' scene at the very end. Queen of Thorns dialogue with Varys was also very nice. My only issue was the Sansa/Marg conversation and Sansa's supposed happiness at being passed over as queen.
233	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-22	I gave it a 5, and stand by it.  But this episode was absolutely incredible!On a 10 point scale there is no possible way you can grade something you consider to be absolutely incredible a 5. Unless by absolutely incredible you mean perfectly mediocre.I gave it a 9. One of the best episodes, nothing glaringly dislikable, but some very powerful moments ("You sound like a woman," Valyrian speech, Sansa looking happy for the first time since Joffrey).I too, like everyone else, enjoyed Daenerys' scene at the very end. Queen of Thorns dialogue with Varys was also very nice. My only issue was the Sansa/Marg conversation and Sansa's supposed happiness at being passed over as queen.Sansa has no motivation to be queen anymore. She just wants to be happy.

234	Caryn Stark	2013-04-22	10/10.... I loved everything except Ros.
235	rystine	2013-04-22	9/10
One of the five best episodes so far in the series.
Dracarys was awesome.
The mutiny at Craster's was everything that it was in the book.
I love that the Tyrells are clearly Lannister's with roses.  The QoT continues to be awesome and Margaery's manipulation of both Joffrey and Sansa is great to watch.  
Theon's story and the bastard's "reveal" has renewed my belief in that storyline.  
And no complaints for Arya.  Plenty to show that the Red God isn't just the "evil" of Mellisandre and there is more to that religion.
236	Rabid Grunt	2013-04-22	I also agree that most are way too lenient on their ratings. A "10" is a perfect episode. Absolutely perfect. Nothing can be critiqued. A "5" is not a bad rating. That is average. As the season progresses the viewers get blinded by their lust for more and give out ridiculous ratings.According to which scale? Yours, or mine?
237	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-22	According to which scale? Yours, or mine?The scale. When something is 10 out of 10 it means it's perfect. If it's 5 out of 10 is average. If it's 1 out of 10 it's garbage. That's how it works.
238	TheNorthReigns	2013-04-22	Gave it a 10, think it's one of the best episodes ever in the series, along with "Baelor" and "Blackwater" to name a few, and to think it's only the 4th episode this season and it's only going to get better.  Liked the KL scenes with Joffrey telling Margaery some of the history of the Targaryen's, whom they seem to be mentioning more this season, Varys and the QoT discussing Sansa, and Tywin telling Cersei that she is not as smart as she thinks she is.  Actually have come to sympathize with 2 of the characters I hated in the past, Theon and Jaime for their acts against the Starks, I mean regarding Jaime, kick a man when he's already down is just cruel.  While the mutiny at Craster's keep was well done, the death of Commander Mormont just didn't have the same effect on me that Ned Stark's beheading did, which was total shock and sadness.  Finally, the Sack of Astapor to say the least was simply stunning.  For me there is no show on TV like GoT, and if doesn't win the Emmy for best drama this year it will be because of prejudices since it's fantasy.  But then again. they said the same thing about LotR, and that  won the Oscar.
239	Table8	2013-04-22	On a 10 point scale there is no possible way you can grade something you consider to be absolutely incredible a 5.

240	Jdawg Laurence	2013-04-22	10 for sure.  Best episode of the season, possibly of all three of the seasons.  Craster's and Astapor were just so well done there, and for Dany to have kept her face so unphased when the slave trader called her a bitch and whore, and then speak Valyrian like that.  Just brilliant.
241	DaveSnow House Stark	2013-04-22	According to which scale? Yours, or mine?I am not a genius but when a scale is 1-10, 1 being worst and 10 being best, a 5 is average. So how is it average and incredible?Sometimes it's just a translation thing.
242	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-22	I gave LAST WEEK'S episode a 5.  I gave this "incredible" episode an 8.Ah, I see. I just felt the need to point it out since people say things like this episode was a bit boring, I gave it a 9. Gotta respect the scale /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
243	LastDragonLives	2013-04-22	Best episode... I think everReally?  Come on.  Dracarys was good... but not as gory or epic as I would have liked.  I'd rather they stretch out the seasons and show more of what is actually going on than cut back and forth so much.  At least this was the first episode without any Catelyn monolouges that are completely made for TV.
244	Swagwell	2013-04-22	Best one this season, liked Blackwater better though so I gave it an 8.
*Queen of Thorns is so great!
I cared very little for her in the books but the actress really makes her come alive, her and Varys' scene was incredible to watch.
*When Ramsay dropped his pious mask to show his true face I thought "finally, HereÂ´s Ramsay!"
.*I really liked the BwB part, especially Beric vs Sandor.
*Crasters Keep was... OK I guess, it did what it was supposed to do...
*Jaime and Brienne... Good conversation between them, but I'm really not feeling the re-imagined Mummers, they seem pretty dull compared to the excellence that the original had to me, I'm not asking them to tame Zebras for them to ride but they could have at least got some of the dothraki costumes put on one or two of them to make them a little more exotic...
*Epic ending, but am I the only one who feels Astapor seems kinda empty and heavy on the CGI? It's like they killed five guys and then everybody was free, why wouldn't the slaves rebel if it was just as easy as 123? 
(gonna watch it again today but those are my initial feelings about this episode)
245	A Redeemed Hound	2013-04-22	Is it the same actor playing Dondarion now who played him in Season 1?  Just wondering.
246	Swagwell	2013-04-22	Is it the same actor playing Dondarion now who played him in Season 1?  Just wondering. If so, he's aged terribly.
247	SerArthurHeath	2013-04-22	The scale. When something is 10 out of 10 it means it's perfect. If it's 5 out of 10 is average. If it's 1 out of 10 it's garbage. That's how it works.Not necessarily. 5/10 could imply half as good as perfect (and frequently does) which would be far less than the modern interpretation of "average" or it's actual meaning if we work on the basis of hypothetical levels of quality rather than actually rating every single work of fiction/art against each other and then working out what average quality is which is an impractical idea at best. Or one could use a logarithmic scale where 10 is 100000 as good as 5. What you describe is NOT the only or even the most popular or correct interpretation of a 0-10 scale
248	Tori Targaryen	2013-04-22	Full marks from me
249	Table8	2013-04-22	Is it the same actor playing Dondarion now who played him in Season 1?  Just wondering.No.  They did a recast.
250	Ondskapsmannen	2013-04-22	10/10
I can't think of anything I didn't like in this episode.
Someone said too bad it's all downhill from here for Dany. I agree to an extent. I think at least in the books she has a few more good moments before she gets bogged down with a war she don't need and can't win. I only hope the end of A dance with dragons is not the end for her as well.
251	Son of Gendry	2013-04-22	Top 5 of all the episodes...9.5/10. Amazing to be that good without any Tyrion-Bronn dialogue. Those two could spin off a sitcom.
One thing that has been a little overshadowed is Margaery's character, which is coming along very nicely. Natalie Dormer was perfect casting. I've loved her since The Tudors. Easy to get overshadowed with Varys/Queen of Thorns, Tywin/Cersei, and of course the Astapor scene, which was perfect and true to GRRM's version.
252	Snookson	2013-04-22	Not necessarily. 5/10 could imply half as good as perfect (and frequently does) which would be far less than the modern interpretation of "average" or it's actual meaning if we work on the basis of hypothetical levels of quality rather than actually rating every single work of fiction/art against each other and then working out what average quality is which is an impractical idea at best. Or one could use a logarithmic scale where 10 is 100000 as good as 5. What you describe is NOT the only or even the most popular or correct interpretation of a 0-10 scaleYou're thinking way too hard about this. A scale from 1-10 is just that. Pretty sure when someone throws something up to rate on a scale of 1-10 they aren't looking to trick anyone.
253	TheWhiteRabbit	2013-04-22	Alright I just watched it again. Pretty badass. I might have to give it a 10. I'm thinking Craster's isn't done yet, right?
254	Fear	2013-04-22	Sansa has no motivation to be queen anymore. She just wants to be happy.Margaery spoke about her cousin and Sansa quipped about how the cousin will have to feign happiness and interest at Marg's wedding. It was somewhat awkward seeing as how Sansa will probably share those sentiments. At one point, being a queen was all she longed for.
255	Tywin's bastard	2013-04-22	I also agree that most are way too lenient on their ratings. A "10" is a perfect episode. Absolutely perfect. Nothing can be critiqued. A "5" is not a bad rating. That is average. As the season progresses the viewers get blinded by their lust for more and give out ridiculous ratings.That seems illogical. Given how extremely rare perfection is (I don't know if any film or TV series episode in history is without the tiniest flaw) it doesn't make sense to dedicate a grade just for that on such a rough scale as that. The sensible way to create a scale is to have all grades useable, not to set aside a tenth of the scale to something virtually unattainable.
256	Dad	2013-04-22	Holy Shit!
I could write a 1000 word review of this episode, but 'Holy Shit!' pretty well sums it up.  The death of Jeor Mormont, the death of Craster, the sacking of Astapor, the final unmasking of 'Boy' as Ramsey Snow, Varys's incredible revenge, Margaery Tyrell playing Joffrey like a fucking harp, the sacking of Astapor (mentioned this twice 'cos it was just that awesome!) Charles Dance being a boss, Beric-fucking-Dondarrion!
Ten out of ten.  Easiest.  Rating.  Ever.
Holy Shit!
257	Abaddon	2013-04-22	Gave it a 9.  (That's 7.5/7 8.5/8 9/9 and 9/9 so far from me).  Although, I've only seen it once and it was in a sadly talkative environment.  So this could end up becoming a 10 once I have a chance to re-watch it...Dracarys is right up there with Baelor as one of the best scenes in the show.  Just brilliant.
258	Ser Luke.	2013-04-22	10/10
The second best episode of the series. Really the only episode that tops it so far is "Blackwater"
But this was simply outstanding. Craster's Keep, Dracarys, they were just done perfectly.
259	Pure Guava	2013-04-22	the final unmasking of 'Boy' as Ramsey SnowEasily one of my favorite "Evil Bastards!" in all of literature (because man is he horrible) so I was severely disppointed last season, thinking he got cut entirely. So when I heard he was being cast I jumped for joy...and although his storyline would appear drastically changed, I absolutely loved the reveal last night. That look on his face was priceless!
260	NeilSpoon	2013-04-22	Solid 8 from me. Great ending, but find the overall pace a little bit slow. It's all coming along nicely tho /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
261	Daske	2013-04-22	Fantastic. Just fantastic.
262	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-22	Such a good episode. 10/10. Kings Landing this episode was beautifully done, Craster was great and Dracarys (not my favourite moment from the books) was good too. My only gripe is that the slaver was uncommonly stupid - but it's the same gripe I had with the book. 
So yeah, really like the direction they've taken with Varys and Olenna - and knowing what is likely to happen makes it pretty satisfying. Also, Jaime and Brienne were great yet again, "Boy" was suitably creepy in those final moments and Beric Dondarrion is setting up nicely. Epic epic episode.
And Episode 5 will be amazing too I think!
263	Maxthestig	2013-04-22	I gave it an 8. I love that 50% voted 10 /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Here is our review of it. Would be good to get your views and comments.https://www.youtube....h?v=5sM_aXw2GeUFavourtie Scene was with Varys, not in the book but BRILLIANTI was hoping for more emotion from the Nights Watch scene, but it did hit me hard when they killed Mormont. After meeting the actor he is a favourite of mine /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
264	Honourable Ser	2013-04-22	10/10 purely for the moment when Ser Barristan Selmy and Ser Jorah Mormont drew swords together. Pure, uncensored pornography.
265	Clan O'Raghallaigh	2013-04-22	10.... best hour of tv i've seen in a long time!
266	Eogh	2013-04-22	This season keeps getting better and better, could not be happier. 10/10
267	Ravi Seaworth	2013-04-22	I give it a 9. Overall, I enjoyed the pace and the acting is mostly superb, given the little understanding I have of acting. I particularly liked the performance of Diana Rigg and her interactions with Varys are simply a feast for my eyes. The episode had two main wow events as expected: LC's death and Dracarys. They made justice to the former, in my opinion, although they did not include many details I would have loved to see. For instance, an interaction between Mormont and Sam would have been emotionally powerful. But I guess there is no space for every single detail. In fact, I'm beginning to have the impression that only including the main events and characters of ASoS in a TV show with 10 one hour episodes is already a titanic challenge. The non-book readers are already having trouble processing so many characters and side stories, let alone the details. I respect the fact they are making the show especially for them. Regarding the Dracarys scene, I really have nothing bad to say about it.

268	Iotun	2013-04-22	Awesome episode. 10/10
269	SummerSong	2013-04-22	10/10.  Seriously considered rating it a 9, but Dany's finale was so freakin' EPIC it's gotta be 10. Impeccably and concisely written, powerfully acted, terrific special effects. Dany owned the commander-in-chief role; her transformation from S1 is just amazing. For the first time I consider her to be a potential worthy ruler of Westeros. The Unsullied and Dracarys had me out of my seat and cheering! This is outstanding entertainment. Thank You, GRRM, D&D & HBO!!!Other favorite scenes:. Varys and everyone - Glad to see him prominently featured again. Conleth Hill quietly steals every scene. Fascinating back story, didn't expect sorcerer-in-a-box! "Revenge is a dish best served cold." I could learn a lot about surviving and thriving in our dog-eat-dog real world from a wise role model like him.. QoT and Margaery - Formidable players. I love it when they out-think and outclass the Lannisters.. Jaime & Brienne - OMG, Jaime's complete helplessness and humiliation, with Brienne successfully taunting him into not giving up. Favorite relationship arc.. Tywin & Cersei - /rofl2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rofl:' /> Charles Dance is superb. He is a cold, cruel parent, but I thoroughly enjoyed the Cersei smackdown. I wonder how he plans to get Joffrey under control? I can't believe it involves the PW, as some suggest, but I may well be naive. Surely offing Joff would be a last resort, even for Tywin.. Night's Watch - Thank God there is finally some action!!! Shit has officially hit the fan. A sad farewell to LC Mormont. Sam the Slayer coming up!. Theon - More great acting in his confessions to Boy in the tunnel, including his regrets and complicated feelings toward the Starks. I dread the fallout from his admission that Bran and Rickon are alive. Makes my skin crawl. And we see the first hint of Ramsay's sadistic glee, yikes.. Honorable mention: Arya's efforts to get justice for Micah. The North Remembers.Truly a standout episode.

270	lostinwesteros	2013-04-22	It was SO awesome seeing Dany kick ass!  I was cheering as I watched it.
Heartbreaking for Jaime -- and the horse piss on top of everything else?  Who is that guy, the Bolton man?  But hooray, Brienne, for bullying him back to the will to live/get revenge....well, at least the will to eat some bread at this point.  Seeing Cersei, then, sitting in front of her father, all 'dolled' up as she usually is....what a contrast!  Is this a Spoiler thread?  In case it's not 
	Spoiler  It just brought to mind how contemptuous and derisive Cersei was when Jaime came back to KL with his golden hand.  

Great diabolical expression on Ramsay's face - poor Theon.  He just can't win.
Arya...confronting The Hound about murdering Micah - really nice.  And the setting for the BWB is great --  I loved that it was even behind a waterfall.
The old Bear!  So sad.  Even though we all knew it was coming.  Craster moved pretty damn quick, though, didn't he?  I am just so glad he's dead, but now I fear for his 'wives'.  I'm sure they'll be ravaged by those that mutinied.  It was great to see Sam, Gilly, and baby boy get away.  I can NOT wait 
	Spoiler  to see Coldhands!!!!! 
 , but I also want to see how Grenn and Ed/Pyp (I think they combined those two characters, didn't they?) get away.  
I wanted to see more of Bran.  Cat turned into such a horrible monster in Bran's nightmare!
Then Varys....good for him!!!
There's more, but the cat's right on top of my keyboard!
271	gash	2013-04-22	best episode from all seasons so far. awesome.
272	Morgain	2013-04-22	OK virgin post here from a totally addicted Welsh lady. Sorry cant show an avatar or anything about me - this forum has weird settings and not even Likes - I'm used to the glories of Xenforo
Anyway Dany of course was superb, and a bit more life to her as much though I admire her she is sometimes a bit po faced. Wonderful closing scene in so many ways.
I was as so often bored by blokes crashing around in dirty furs oop north all very dark and dreary, muddled and manly. Though nice to see podgy boy taking initiative. Bit annoying that the team couldn't cope with calming a baby by stuffing a tit at it. After all they are quick enough to flash tit for other reasons why not for waht they are designed? Public shock I suppose breastfeeding being modern porn.
Thank heavens I didn't have to endure that snotty spear wife yet again doing the knowitall on Jon Snow - can't she ever do anything except do cheap sneers? Boring. Thought I like the design of her coat.
Arya and Bran pretty good stuff. Jaime oh Jaime as he said in interview, very dark time. Good drama. Though for heavens sake a chopped wrist wouldnt be like that. It's not like a sprain - agony and a lot of mess with bits falling off.
Varys nice backstory explaining him.
Tywin and Cersei good but best of all in Kings Landing is the surprising change in Joff under Marj's clever handling. Shame he doesnt have that long to show he can be a cutie!
Queen of thorns not so much. Di Rigg is just yet another feisty old dear - yawn.
Sansai obviously heading for disappointment now new hope awakened. She's just too tragic to get what she wants though the friendship with Marj is cool.
Oh but I have to go watch Dany and the dragons and her fluent Valyrien again.
Too many boring bits so I only gave 8 but the good bits were superb.

273	aFeastForDragons	2013-04-22	10
Not a single complaint the entire episode. After the Stannis atrocity last week I was a bit worried they would mess up Beric or someone else but this episode was brilliant!
Hopefully the rest of this season stays this good.
274	Stark Winds	2013-04-22	Oh seven hells. I meant to say 10 but I pressed 9 by accident. Oh my goodness! What an episode! 
Although I wished LC Mormont could have taken Craster out instead of being stabbed in the back, but since I don't really remember exactly HOW he died...I can't say if it was canon or not. 
First time I've whole-heartedly been cheering DANY DANY since the end of the first season. What a "OH BURN" moment (pun intended) when she was like "Valyrian is my mother tongue!" (I understood you when you called me bitch and whore). That ending shot with the Unsullied, and Dany just dropping the whip like that, and the dragons flying in the sky...I have chills
275	Reposado	2013-04-22	7, not as good as last week, although a better bunch of scenes at the end.
quite a bit of fluff in the middle, and still, its just a collection of scenes, not really a complete episode.
276	Hound Dog	2013-04-22	10/10 purely for the moment when Ser Barristan Selmy and Ser Jorah Mormont drew swords together. Pure, uncensored pornography.Nice.
277	Cordite	2013-04-22	Really enjoyed the episodes, there's just one problem I have. Sometimes the way Margaery walks she just starts throwing her shoulders around and looks very weird. It happens in this episode in the scene with Sansa.
278	redriver	2013-04-22	10.Simply astonishing.
On the re watches little touches kick in,-Varys to Tyrion "You will have your revenge...if you have the stomach for it."

281	GSP	2013-04-22	Awesome episode! And entirely boobless, oddly enough. It's like they had to fast forward some plot to make up for all of last week's useless nudy scenes. Thank you whoever at HBO got on that.
282	Osric	2013-04-22	10/10 purely for the moment when Ser Barristan Selmy and Ser Jorah Mormont drew swords together. Pure, uncensored pornography.wtf dude, lot of nude scenes and you pick Barristan and Jorah? that's brave.Everything was excelent, dragons incredibles, Varys and QoT amazing, the last scene with de unsullied army and the dragons flying was so exciting. And the NG fight was a moment that I hoped would never come 'cause I felt really sad with the death of Lor Mormont in the book and seeing it made me a little more sad. Jaime and Briene relationship is growing, everything was just incredible.The only thing I still don't get is all the Podrick and the whores thing, what's up with that?
283	Baltan	2013-04-22	7, not as good as last week, although a better bunch of scenes at the end.quite a bit of fluff in the middle, and still, its just a collection of scenes, not really a complete episode.I agree. Dany's scene was amazing, but I didn't finish saying O-M-G and it was already over. The same as Craster's scene, I just expected much more blood.Great episode though
284	TheOldGodsAndTheNew	2013-04-22	I completely agree (about Emilia Clarke)  She is on screen as I imagined her from the books.  I do not like the way Royce Dotrice makes her sound on the audible, but not much could've been done about that.I also listened to the audiobook of A Dance With Dragons and the reader (Roy Dotrice) makes Daenerys sound like a leprechan!  /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />  It made me cringe, I almost couldn't listen to it!  Gods be good, you'd expect more from such a highly produced franchise!  Oh well.But anyway, ep. 304 was great, second only to Blackwater IMHO. The scene when Theon sees the wooden "X", the look on his face, the look on Ramsay's face...chilling.Jaime's captivity is coming along nicely, they're doing a great job of portraying his character arc, as well as Brienne.The Night's Watch mutiny was a bit rushed, but still a great scene...I just wish it had gone on a little longer, I guess that's a sign that it was good.Tywin being Tywin...like a boss. Charles Dance plays the role perfectly.Sandor and the Brotherhood Without Banners: Sandor spitting vitriolic hate, Arya calling out Sandor for Micah's murder, Beric Dondarian challenging him....all well done!  /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />The ending was f'ing epic!  Definite nerdgasm!  In addition to Emilia Clarke, I love Ian Glenn's acting, he's such a badass, he always delivers in any scene.  The final shot of the ranks of unsullied marching out... /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />
285	Lady Shadow Cat	2013-04-22	Emilia Clarke did an amazing job on her part!   Ive been waiting for this scene since I read SOS. A lot of other great scenes as well!!
I watch with non readers and seeing them freak out 
	Spoiler at LC being killed and Dracarys
 just added to the entertainment for me!

286	Leto Atreides	2013-04-22	One of the best episode in a long time. The scene with Daenerys was awesome. It was better than anything she did in the whole of season 2, proving once again that when you stay faithful to the book, you get the best results. Also, no softcore porn in this episode, which is always a plus.

And SerArthurHeath, that's not a dig at you; I myself studied stats.  It's just that often times you can't reconcile emotion with statistics.  And that's what this thread is about: emotion.  FYI for anyone who cares, the weighted average rating of this episode is 9.25 (rounded to two decimal places).  Also, I think my post just made the nerd-o-meter explode. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
288	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	10 FOR DRACARYS BABY.
289	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	I gave an 8, my highest rating this season.
Didnt like Varys and QoT, Varys and Ros but now I want to change to a 9.  I really enjoyed all the other scenes.
290	Reposado	2013-04-22	i feel like a lot of these high ratings are going by the high notes. to each his own and all that, but it seems a strange way to do it
291	Northern Pride	2013-04-22	I gave a 9 but to me this was one of, if not the best episode to date. I almost gave it a 10 but I'm reserving that for a future episode. Vargo Hoat is as nasty if not nastier in the tv version as he is in the book. Throwing Varys's torturer into the episode was deviously clever. Daenerys Stormborn/Targaryen and her Valyrian speech was beautiful to listen to. Topping it off was the Dragon and the Unsullied. Very impressed with HBO's special effects here. Made the "Spartacus" Roman army look like Davy and Goliath clay figurines. Well done. Better than Blackwater to me because the books description of that battle couldn't be duplicated. Left me a little disappointed actually because my expectations were just too high. This episode just blew me away because I wasn't expecting much to be honest and came away with my jaw gaping with this one.
292	Steve Stark	2013-04-22	Holy Shit!I could write a 1000 word review of this episode, but 'Holy Shit!' pretty well sums it up.  The death of Jeor Mormont, the death of Craster, the sacking of Astapor, the final unmasking of 'Boy' as Ramsey Snow, Varys's incredible revenge, Margaery Tyrell playing Joffrey like a fucking harp, the sacking of Astapor (mentioned this twice 'cos it was just that awesome!) Charles Dance being a boss, Beric-fucking-Dondarrion!Ten out of ten.  Easiest.  Rating.  Ever.Holy Shit!This made me laugh. Playing him like a fucking harp...lol. I gave the episode a 9. I'm right there with you. I actually hold it at a 9.5 out of 10, but after having two kids that baby's screaming in the beginning made me want to kill something, and more importantly I was upset Mormont didn't get his final words. Other than that, I was happy and think it was nearly flawless television.
293	KnightsOfDany	2013-04-23	I went with a 9 it may have been one of the best episodes to date. The action kicked up in the final act but the rest of the scenes slow as they seemed were extremely compelling and amazing.
294	Swan Targ	2013-04-23	Awesome episode! And entirely boobless, oddly enough. It's like they had to fast forward some plot to make up for all of last week's useless nudy scenes. Thank you whoever at HBO got on that.Agree completely.I think this is the best episode of this season so far and one of the best in the series.Absolutely perfect.I was just waiting for Dany to start speaking valyrian and I orgasmed from then on. And finally not one single worthless scene in this episode either.10!!!

295	GeorgeIAF	2013-04-23	I gave it a 9, it is always space for improvement. I liked almost every scene except for Varys and Ros, the ending was fantastic, let alone the Bastard's betrayal, that look in his eyes, also the mutiny at Crasters was neatly done. Good work D&D!
296	Kenyatta	2013-04-23	I gave it a 9. As long as they keep showing scenes with Bran it will never be a 10. The story is a complete waste in the books (so far) and it translates even worse to the screen.
Great episode regardless. Possibly one of the best yet. But I'm still waiting for the Holy Grail of episodes of it even exists, the episode that leaves you absolutely speechless at the end and you know you've witnessed something you'll probably never see again. Maybe it is a standard I have set too high for this show. But I don't think so. I still believe the best is yet to come.
297	Swan Targ	2013-04-23	I know.Margery and her shoulder throwing almost ruined it for me.That was also weird to meBut I noticed she is toning down her Anne Boleyn vibe, so that's a good thing
298	Ser Ilyn's Tongue	2013-04-23	I gave it a 9.  Fantastic episode, The first really good one this series.  Well acted (as ever) but well written and directed too.  Hardly any filler (apart from the Bran scene - but that's OK cos I like Bran) and everything made sense.
Varys and Olenna were especially good, I thought.
If the rest of the series can stay at this level, I will be very happy.
299	Ser Ilyn's Tongue	2013-04-23	Actually, my only minor niggle was the symbolic dropping of the whip in the Dracarys scene.  As a whole it was a good scene, but that was just a bit extra cheesey and therefore distracting.
300	WatcherontheRock	2013-04-23	I give a 9, because for me Blackwater remains the only episode which deserves 10. 
That said, this episode was just fantastic. All the scenes were at least good, Bran's and Arya's a little below the rest. 
And Dany's just perfect, and there are not so many in the series. This scene is in the top 5 of the series, and this episode in the top 5 of the series as well. 
I hope I'll give a 10 to a certain episode 9, where "the drums were pounding, pounding, pounding".
301	Leto Atreides	2013-04-23	. Very impressed with HBO's special effects here. Made the "Spartacus" Roman army look like Davy and Goliath clay figurines. Well done. Better than Blackwater to me because the books description of that battle couldn't be duplicated. Left me a little disappointed actually because my expectations were just too high. This episode just blew me away because I wasn't expecting much to be honest and came away with my jaw gaping with this one. Blackwater lacked some CGI shots to show how big the battle was. It looked like Stannis was trying to take King's Landing with 50 men and 5 boats.
302	Valar Morghulis Not Today	2013-04-23	Loved it, favourite episode of the season so far.  Loved the look in the boy's eyes when Theon realised he was back where he started.  Like the fact it's still confusing and that my non-book reading friends all have no idea where he is.Slightly confused by Varys' part, it didn't seem to flow quite so much (interesting new scene), and didn't like that he was planting the idea in the QoT's mind for Sansa (can understand why it's not Willas, got to trim the character numbers somewhere - (nbr) friends do have a problem keeping track, although really like in the book when Sansa thinks they are talking about Loras and they actually mean Willas).  Also, he knows far too much about LF.Tywin is awesome, great subtle moment with Cersei where he corrects her pronunciation of Tyrell whilst dressing her down.Then of course we have the Old Bear's death, all of my (nbr) friends were completely shocked by it.  That's part of why GoT is great, that things you don't expect to happen do - they all thought we'd lose a character (Jamie or Brienne) last week but weren't expecting a major one this week.Also, I'm not a huge fan of Emilia Clarke's acting in most of the series, yet she has the odd scene where she plays it perfectly, I think this was one of those. Dracarys!9/10
303	Valar Morghulis Not Today	2013-04-23	God and I even forgot to mention the great Jamie scenes, they are doing a great job with Vargo Hoat (or whatever the TV show is calling him).
Bran's scene was the only one that totally seemed like filler to me, though Arya/the Hound could have waited til next week (but was really good).
304	Dolores Stark	2013-04-23	This episode was such an emotional roller coaster! 
Varys telling his cutting story to Tyrion, and the moment we see his face in the mirror... I loved the way he looked almost terrifying and totally different from the tattle tale chubby some think him to be. And everything with him in this episode was amazing! (nonexistent bumps/decrepit JUST EPIC!)
Jaimie getting his portion of the real world, seeing his spirits get crushed onscreen was heartbreaking.
Tywin/Cercei dialogue was great, also Cercei/QoT, Marg/ Sansa. It was so sad seeing two of them together, thinking how they could be good friends if the circumstances were different.
"My real father lost his head in King's Landing" /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> 
	Spoiler I don't know how will I endure the "I should've died with him" line

And the look on "the Boy's" face minutes after that was wooooow!
I loved how they reintroduced Beric to non readers, the entire cave scene was badass.
And, of course, Dracarys... She is not one of my fav characters, but I was cheering from the top of my lungs, even though I knew what was coming. Her speech in Valyrian, proud looks on Jorah's and Barristan's faces and everything about that scene was just perfect. GIRL POWER!!!
Kudos to the music guy, he nailed it.
305	Crown	2013-04-23	Loved it, a solid 9.
306	JATR	2013-04-23	Wow. A 10 for this episode.
at this rate I don't know how we should rate the next episode ;-):
Episode 1	 7
Episode 2	 8
Episode 3	 9
Episode 4	 10
Loved the sarcasm of the QoT over their own words and sigil and praise over some of the others....
307	Talagand	2013-04-23	This was my favorite episode of GoT so far. Go Daenerys!
308	Rhaegarsjoy	2013-04-23	8/10 because Dany's scene in the end was great. Could have taken bran, ros n Varys n tyrion n Varys scenes out and to get more of robb n cat since the RW is happening I would have loved to see of them b4 the RW as suppose to those pointless scene they show Wont die if they do one episode without tyrion n ROS.
309	kevin1989	2013-04-23	I gave it a 9. just because there are bigger episodes to come, a 10 would be to high. But still one of the greatest episodes that GoT had got.
310	BreastplateWithNipples	2013-04-23	11 out of ten, that's how awesome this episode was. /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />
Easily one of the top 3 episodes of the entire series.

311	reeser	2013-04-23	Besides the obvious (and amazing) wow moments.  I loved the scenes with background information like Joffrey telling Marg about the Targs and The Hound/Brotherhood scene.  One of the best episodes yet, in my opinion, 10/10! Yeah I loved that part because it gave the viewer some of the backstory of the depth Targ influence has had over the continent. Between this and the dialog about Rhaegar between Daen, Jorah and Selmy we get finally get rejection of the Targ = evil or bad by default. Same with the developments with Jaime where we finally see the changes from the book from arrogant amazing swordsmen into a man. I really hope they give us the background from the books on the primary reason WHY he ran Aerys thru so that tv viewers get an even better understanding of him. And yeah I liked the Hound/Brotherhood scene too though Im not sure why Hound had that worried/shock look on his face about having to face  about facing Beric....not like he has a bad track record against him!
312	reeser	2013-04-23	I didn't pick up on this when I watched the episode, but Theon saying his "real father lost his head in King's Landing" is out of character and a bit cringeworthy in all honesty. Theon saw Robb as a brother, but Ned was NEVER a father figure towards him. He couldn't be; he knew one day he may have had to execute him. Yes but it does show the thinking that is logical from Theon's pov that his own flesh and blood cared less about him then the man who treated him well who was technically his hostage taker. Says more against Balon Greyjoy then being about Ned.
313	insertname	2013-04-23	10, without a single doubt. Even before Astapor I already thought "Damn! This is a great episode". Would already given a 10 there. And of course Dracarys nailed it.
314	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-23	8/10 It was a great episode! I think it was better than last week, and the best episode so far. However, I didn't like some things so it couldn't get to 9.
315	DaveSnow House Stark	2013-04-23	Ok, so when Cersei and Tywin are talking about Joffery and how bad she has handled him; and she says to him that he should try stopping him from doing something he enjoys, Tywin replies, I will. Am I the only one that thinks this is the hint toward the Sansa / Tyrion wedding? He will be taking Joffery's play thing away from him by marrying her to Tyrion.
316	The Girl King	2013-04-23	l recently got my mother to watch the show and she's pretty religious (will probably never read the books). she is now hooked and her favorite character is Dany. l can die happy now
317	SerArthurHeath	2013-04-23	You're thinking way too hard about this. A scale from 1-10 is just that. Pretty sure when someone throws something up to rate on a scale of 1-10 they aren't looking to trick anyone.Yes and most people, with fair logic, would say a 7/10 is average, average actually meaning fairly decent quality. My second example was facetious admittedly
318	lil_z	2013-04-23	I absolutely loved this episode. I am a book reader so I knew the scene with Dany was coming but wasn't sure how they would do it or when. I was certainly not disappointed.
I loved Vayrs comment about Lord Bailish "he would burn down the kingdom if he could be king of the ashes." A wonderful touch. I've enjoyed some of the additions HBO has made to the TV series, some I think should have ended up in the books.
All around 10, great episode
319	Eric Baratheon	2013-04-23	After the first three episodes I was losing hope for season 3. I've got an average rate of 4 / 5 out of 10 for episodes 1 through 3, but this week's was a solid 7, saved by the almost-perfect sequence at Astapor. I felt the rebellion of the Night's Watch against eachother was handled pretty well. I feel, however, that Theon's character arc setting with Roose's bastard took too long.
This season, save for the event's unfolding behind the scenes (so to speak) at King's Landing, is pretty much like the book. People moving through Westeros / Essos. In the book, everything is handled superbly with GRRM at the very top of his game.
In a 10 episodes-for-season annual TV show, however, it might have the potential to alienate viewers, who will soon enough start losing track of who's who and where they are or even how they got there.
I am really hoping, now that we are mid-season, things will pick up from this week's episode and we'll see better and better from GoT on TV. Bring on those damn weddings already
320	protar	2013-04-23	Gave it a 9. I really wish I could give an 8.5 because I never give 10 (that would imply a perfect episode) and reserve nine for the absolute top notch. But it was also much better than E3 which I can an 8. So I'll generously round it up to a 9. And that's definitely because of both the mutiny at Crasters and of course Dracarys! I had my quibbles but hey, like I say no episode will ever be perfect.
321	Cas Stark	2013-04-23	By far the best episode of the season.  I don't understand why it takes them so long to hit their stride, it isn't like they've got a lot of episdoes to spare.  No complaints with this one.
322	skhansa1559	2013-04-23	A tiny detail, but seeing Ser Barristan's eyes light up while he drew his sword during Dracarys was one of my favorite moments.
323	King of Hats	2013-04-23	Much better. I gave it 8/10
Take marks off because I don't really like the portrayal of the BWB so far.
The look between Jorah and Barristan at the end was worth a point on it's own though!
					
					
							Edited by King of Hats, 23 April 2013 - 02:13 PM.
324	gordonah	2013-04-23	I gave this one a 9. Lots of good scenes, and none that I found weak or annoying. I particularly liked the Brotherhood Without Banners, Unsullied and Varys backstory scenes.
325	King Tyrion I	2013-04-23	9.5 of 10.
I loved the Cersei/Tywin scene, the Olenna scenes (especially the one with Varys), Dany's scene in Astapor.
Sansa was great, Margaery was fine and Ramsay's playing of Theon, too. Sandor Clegane and Beric Dondarion: nicely acted.
And of course the events relating to the NW.
326	I'll pay the iron price	2013-04-23	This whole series is good in that it keeps all major stories rolling with screen time.
Jaime/Brienne
Joffrey/Kings Landing
Dany
Knights watch
Theon/Ramsay
Each episode gives you a blast of everything
327	Marco	2013-04-23	Ramsay was very good /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />

329	Lyana	2013-04-23	Voted 9. The best episode so far. The final scenes were pure epicness.
330	Ashas Globetrotter	2013-04-23	A 9 for me, not quite as good as last week's 10.  Overall it was really amazing episode, with some great dialogue and moments.  Also, Beric was goddamn awesome.  But there were two issues that stopped it from being a perfect 10.1) Jack Gleeson is so good that I legitimately can't stand watching extended Joffrey scenes.  I know that's a credit to him and the writing, but if I so can't stand a scene that I'll mute it until it's over so I don't have to listen to him, that's an issue.  I know that's my issue, but this is my rating.  Even with this, the episode would probably still be a 10, but...2) I never much liked the Dracarys scene.  I thought it was silly in the books and I thought it was silly here.  It never made sense that the slavers would be so stupid, I don't care how "blinded by greed" they are supposed to be.  So, the music was epic and the visuals were cool, but I just didn't like the scene.  I was hoping the writers would find some sort of change to the transaction so that the end effect was the same, but that the process would make more sense.  They didn't, so the episode ended on a silly note, so its a 9.Yes, sorry to say you do have some issues. If you mute scenes of a show, you shouldn`t be watching it.
331	Apple9	2013-04-23	10/10 would watch again.
One of mynon-book  friends said Off to Westeros after the Dany scene. I had no face after he said that.
332	Lady of Long Lake	2013-04-23	10
The only other episode I've liked as much as this one was Blackwater.
333	Isildur's Mane	2013-04-23	I gave it a 9.
I really loved this episode, the only reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 is because I don't like how Ros and Varys are working together for some reason.
Loved, loved, loved everything else though! And that ending!
I love the music to the ending too.
334	Lady of Long Lake	2013-04-23	I gave it a 9.I really loved this episode, the only reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 is because I don't like how Ros and Varys are working together for some reason.Loved, loved, loved everything else though!

337	Dragon Doll	2013-04-23	Nearly in tears, i was so happy with the end!
Even the small changes from the book felt appropriate.
This episode captured everything i felt as i was first reading it.
Barvo!
338	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2013-04-24	Ever since I read the scene with Dany taking Astapor I've been waiting to see it.  I was not disappointed.Amen! the look on Kraznys's face when he realized Dany speaks Valyrian was priceless /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />
339	Definitely Mayhaps	2013-04-24	7/10The good;- Dany at the end, obviously, was very well done indeed. It still wasn't as awesome as it was in the book but I liked the score, the dropping of the whip, the tapping of the spears and, of course, the Valyrian speech was incredibly well delivered. Certainly Clarke's best performance; she can act well if the scene is faithful and well written, unlike Qarth.- Theon being delivered back to the Dreadfort. Oh yeah, I loved that.- Jaime/Brienne. I'm loving their stuff on TV. Cannot wait to see Jaime get his revenge on the 'Not Vargo' guy, hopefully it will be brutal.- Cersei/Tywin, a short scene but a good one, not in the books but they stuck to the characters well enough for it to work for everyone.- Beric reveal. Yeah, knew he would look a bit more 'normal' than book Beric but still, I really like the actor who plays him. Anticipation for the Hound fight is sky high.The disappointing:- I found Crasters underwhelming and Mormont's death felt like any other, without the last words to Sam (possibly scewed to fit the 'I forbid you to die' line from the earlier episode) and yelling about the cursed breach of guest right.- Varys/Tyrion. This scene was boring, just a re-telling of a story I know well and I found the sorcerer in a box to be utterly ridiculous.- Too much of LF's plans are getting hinted at. I would've preferred if they had kept it under wraps until after the PW and used Dontos for Sansa's escape plot.- They seem to be elaborating a bit on Pod's sexual exploits. That was a fun scene that subtly came in to distract but add a bit of humour to a grim story, I don't want it to become a major element as that is too distracting and there is already enough to distract viewers away from the tense storyline as it is.All in all, a decent to good episode, not as amazing as everyone is making it out to be but still very good, especially the Theon bit and Dracarys. Honestly did feel the season premiere was stronger.

340	gwenyth	2013-04-24	An 8.  The final scene with Drac was excellent - they've done a terrific job with the Dragons.  The Night's Watch scenes were very good, the tension and then betrayal at Caster's very well done.  Jaime and Brienne also well done (just a side note, standing in the supermarket line I noticed that Nicolaj C-W* is on on the cover of "Men's Health.") 
The King's Landing scenes ... not so much.  Why waste time on the *Margaery and Sansa little "joke?"  Why add *Vary's  holding the Sorcerer captive?   Theon just bores me, as he does in the books, but I admit that is ideosyncratic and it's not a judgement on the scenes - I'm too biased to evaluate them at all fairly - if one can ever be "fair" in such a totally subjective realm as responding to any "art" form.
*(I can't spell and don't have time to look up these names)
341	MorbidRabbit	2013-04-24	9/10
Il loved everything but I become frustrated by the lack of explanations they give.
In this episode, the BwB is the main issue : are non-readers supposed to remember the non-speaking guy sent by Ned Stark to kill the mountain in season 1 ? also, is it possible for them to understand that Thoros of Myr is a red priest ?
I really hope the explanations will come soon. I really enjoyed discussing the episodes with non-readers last year, but this year they become more and more confused with the story. One of them even told me he thought Gregor Clegane had been killed in season 2.
I also don't like the "Pod=sex god" plot but I still hope it will be revealed as some kind of trick from Tyrion or Pod himself.
I understand those who think the Theon/Ramsay scenes should not be there at all, but I think it is important to have a proper introduction of Ramsay. Of course having him introduced in season 2 just like in the books, would have been much better.
Best scene = Craster and the Night's Watch.
Best surprise = I really like the way they handle the intrigues in King's Landing. The Tyrells are great.
342	A Redeemed Hound	2013-04-24	After watching the episode again last night, I changed my vote from a 9 to an 8.  The whole fall of Lord Mormont was not handled very well IMO.  I wish there was more to it.  Like Sam holding him as he died and hearing his talk about his son Jorah.  Something more emotional than what we got.  It was far too rushed.  My parents and a woman at work who do not know the books didn't even realize that Mormont was killed or that we was even that important to begin with.  I still love the rest of the episode.  It's all just so rushed though.  HBO really dropped the ball with just 10 50-minute episodes.  The season premiere and finale should be 2 hours.  Even 90 mins would suffice.
343	athousandeyesand1	2013-04-24	I gave it a 10 simply because the scene with dany. I've read all the books but when I saw her really come into her own on screen it was EPIC. The dragons are better than ever and will only get better, I loved the episode. DRACARYS DRACARYS DRACARYS.
344	HopeForSpring	2013-04-24	The Dany parts saved this episode from being lower than a 6 for me. 
The non book readers I was watching it with are completely confused.
I agree with the lack of emotionality around Mormont's death. The "Tell my son to join the watch" was important. I don't think they even get or remember that that is the same as the dude with Dany.
I could live with the Pod joke in the last episode. In this one it is sophomoric. 
Beric has no Pathos.
I'm good with the back filling of seeing what happens to Theon rather than just hearing about it snatches of memory.
Any scene with Margary in it is good. She's rocking it.
345	Caryn Stark	2013-04-24	10/10 would watch again.One of mynon-book  friends said Off to Westeros after the Dany scene. I had no face after he said that.My non-book friends had the same ideas... It's going to be a long few years of dead face while they slowly figure out she is never leaving Essos...
346	A Redeemed Hound	2013-04-24	Agreed.  Every non-book reader I know (and they are not dummies either) is totally confused about everything but Dany's story since she is off on her own and her story is more easy to follow.  But they have no clue what is going on with Jon Snow.  No clue who Arya is with.  No clue what Bran is up to.  No idea what anyone in King's Landing is talking about.  No clue who Jaime Lannister is with.  No idea who Theon is with or why he is even there.
347	Rabid Grunt	2013-04-24	The scale. When something is 10 out of 10 it means it's perfect. If it's 5 out of 10 is average. If it's 1 out of 10 it's garbage. That's how it works.Compared to what? How good an episode of TV it was in general? How good an episode of Game of Thrones it was?Also, concerning the whole "Mormont telling sam about his son" scene... how many non-book viewers do you think actually know Jorah is Jeor's son? NONE of my non-reading friends know, and thus it would be a pretty redundant scene.

348	Lord of Castamere	2013-04-24	Another solid 8. TV Dany seems to be lot less irritating this year,which is great. I also like very much how Tyrells are lot more active compared to books. I have to admit. I do not get the Podrick is sex God thing, but thats not bad. The whole plot line is slightly amusing,nothing more, nothing less. I also like that TywinÂ´s "family man" side is being brought up, children after children. Cant wait to see if he keeps his promise concerning his Grandson. The series this year has been great tv so far, but im still waiting for more.Maybe i am just greedy like that.
349	chilammx	2013-04-24	I liked the chapter a lot.
I give it a 9.
The army leaving Astapor was a pretty good sight.
350	Duncan Disorderly	2013-04-24	Pleased that I picked up on Dany's little secret last week. When she had the whip in her hand and started talking, I punched the air and cheered. lol For once, GoT played out more or less as I imagined it would. 
As a non-book viewer, I haven't found this season too confusing. The last two episodes were saved by their endings. Everything else seems to be rambling along. That said, I am totally enjoying it. Also, I reserve my full judgement until the end of the season. Watching them back to back gives me a new perspective. In the UK, we have Thronecast, sometimes that fills in any gaps. The way I see it, the dynamics will radically change anyway, once they realise who the real enemy is. Everything so far is almost a filler, building up the tension. 
By far, GoT is the best show I have watched. Resisting the temptation to buy the books has been tough but I think it's better to be surprised. I can drown my sorrows in the books when the show ultimately finishes. 
I'd like to add that, so far, my favourite scene this season was the chair scene with the imp and sis. Genius. 
Peace.
351	Joyful Union	2013-04-24	Also, concerning the whole "Mormont telling sam about his son" scene... how many non-book viewers do you think actually know Jorah is Jeor's son? NONE of my non-reading friends know, and thus it would be a pretty redundant scene.Not to mention cheesy as hell. And fairly nonsensical, seeing as a lot of the mutineers hated Sam in the books and the show, and would kill him in a second given the chance.
352	Conchobar	2013-04-24	After watching the episode again last night, I changed my vote from a 9 to an 8.  The whole fall of Lord Mormont was not handled very well IMO.  I wish there was more to it.  Like Sam holding him as he died and hearing his talk about his son Jorah.  Something more emotional than what we got.  It was far too rushed.  My parents and a woman at work who do not know the books didn't even realize that Mormont was killed or that we was even that important to begin with.  I still love the rest of the episode.  It's all just so rushed though.  HBO really dropped the ball with just 10 50-minute episodes.  The season premiere and finale should be 2 hours.  Even 90 mins would suffice.sam holding him as he died? While men were butchered all around them? And Mormont's killer( the guy who hates Sam) was probably very close and looking to kill him. Don't think that would have come across very well on tv without looking cliche and silly.
353	RottenAppleFossoway	2013-04-24	Gave it a 10. That was an excellent episode IMHO. As good as any of the entire series.
My only real complaint is the dearth of Bran and Jon this season. Even the scenes they get are either bizarre (Bran dreams and Jojen is in the dreams?) or too short (pretty much every Jon/wildling scene).
354	Kaethas	2013-04-25	I gave it a big 9. Overall it was very good but the ending with Dany really pulled it up. Amazing!
There are still some things in the various storylines I don't like, but you can't get a 100 % perfect episode of course.
355	Tony Soprano	2013-04-25	A perfect 10. This is easily my favorite episode of the show so far. Everything was great, but the ending just took my breath away.
356	Tywin's bastard	2013-04-25	Agreed.  Every non-book reader I know (and they are not dummies either) is totally confused about everything but Dany's story since she is off on her own and her story is more easy to follow.  But they have no clue what is going on with Jon Snow.  No clue who Arya is with.  No clue what Bran is up to.  No idea what anyone in King's Landing is talking about.  No clue who Jaime Lannister is with.  No idea who Theon is with or why he is even there.It's obviously not a show for those that don't keep up when a lot of information is thrown at them as most of those things have been explained. The non-readers I know don't seem very confused about it, even though they of course can't grasp every single detail as it's a demanding show with more depth than what you get at first glance. As for Bran we're not even supposed to know where he's going since he obviously doesn't know that himself. They are just staying hidden. The Theon part is also quite obviously meant to be confusing since we're experiencing it through him, although there's of course been a few visual clues to where he is thrown around.
357	Ravi Seaworth	2013-04-25	What my non-reader friends told me was that it is simply too much information for them. They said there should be a wiki /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />. I agree that some parts could be explained better, but it is definitely not an easy task pleasing two opposite audiences: readers vs non-readers. It is extremely difficult to follow such a rich book, full of important events and characters. But, overall, they are enjoying it and are getting the most important aspects of the story. In fact, they already make connections that didn't occur to me.

It is extremely difficult to follow such a rich book, full of important events and characters. But, overall, they are enjoying it and are getting the most important aspects of the story. In fact, they already make connections that didn't occur to me.My bf and his friends (non bookies) are pretty confused. Of course they don't remember Beric being sent by Ned to kill the Mountain. The scene lasted like 10 seconds and was never brought up again. They thought the entire NW has turned, except for Sam, and I agree that was how it looked. That whole scene was just very rushed and could have been done better.I also thought this would have been an ideal episode to reveal Boy's actual identity. By now yeah we know he's crazy. But we don't know that he is Roose's bastard Ramsay at the Dreadfort. The whole "who is boy" thing is starting to drag, and no longer a mystery but just irritating. My bf told me to just go ahead and tell him who he is.I have no qualms about Dany's scene though... *cringes* ok, EXCEPT for, why is she still wearing the same clothes? Someone mentioned that last episode and I was thinking it's nothing to complain about.. but three episodes in a row? And on her biggest episode since her dragon reveal (I won't complain about her wardrobe in that one /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> ) I wanted her to wear something different. Even Missandei changed, and she has been a slave all her life! I did like the added cape though, cool touch!... On a side note, I think that David Peterson has done a brilliant job creating the Valyrian language! He even gets the different dialects down, like Astapori Valyrian, etc.. anyone wanting to read more about it, here is a link to his post on his website:http://www.dothraki..../high-valyrian/Anyways, I gave the ep a 10 on Dany alone.
359	The Mondrian Oak	2013-04-25	And some even say the show DUMBS the story down too much. Non readers are already experiencing problems in following THIS adaptation. Some people simply do not know what they're talking about.
360	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-25	My non-reader friends aren't confused much at all, except for with Boy which is obviously done on purpose. But they don't just watch it because, they're pretty obsessed. Occassionally they do ask questions that I'll explain from previous episodes, little bits of information they missed to explain something. But that's a good thing. Rewatchability is great, and reading through the books the first time I must have missed hundreds of things that I picked up on re-reads.
361	Keyboard of the Morning	2013-04-25	I would've like to have seen a little more destruction and carnage...more of the Unsullied running through the streets just killing people in tokars and breaking chains and a lot more of the city burning.  Thats just me though.  The point was already well made.
Also there are several divergences from the book.  Margarey's continued mentoring and manipulating of Joffrey.  Loved it.  I love where they're going with it.
We are introduced to Varys' sorcerer....not sure how its gonna go...could be interesting but it could go either way.
The whole Pod as a Lady's man so incredible the whores are giving it away.  It seems like they copied a Dos Equis commercial; "So suave, prostitues  pay him."  I know its only been one episode but it doesen't seem like it has the legs.  I like my Pod's bumbling if not well-intentioned and honorable with a knack for coming through in the clutch.
Geat episode, too many question marks plus I don't know that we have a true feeling for just how good the Unsullied are.  Can't give it a "10".  Final grade, "8".

No clue who Jaime Lannister is with.  No idea who Theon is with or why he is even there.If there really was such a widespread confusing about virtually every aspect of the show, I doubt it would get new viewership records almost every week.

Can't give it a "10".  Final grade, "8".I agree with you. It was a great episode but giving 10s this early hm ... I gave it an 8. If episode 04 is like this imagine what is coming, and than the 10s are not the same.
364	King Kev.	2013-04-25	Fantastic episode. Loved that we started right back up where we left off, with Jaime. I've got to say, as much as I fucking despised him after he pushed Bran out of the battlements, I'm feeling sorry for the guy. The one thing he was known for was his skills in battle, and you can tell he's a broken man without his hand. Brienne gave him a stern talking too though. He needs to toughen up and soldier on.
Speaking of feeling sorry for characters, motherfucking Theon, man. He's going through some rough shit. Escapes, only to be led right back to the torture chamber. "My real father lost his head at King's Landing." Great stuff, great stuff. Varys and his adventures were great to see as well, and I'm very interested in where the hell this whole sorcerer thing is headed. Tyrion only had one scene this episode, but it gave us some great Varys stuff, so it's okay. Margaery continues to dig her claws into Joffrey, and it's pissing Cersei off. Loved Tywin telling her off.
Damn it though, I was sad to see Jeor Mormont get cut down like that. Glad Craster got his comeuppance though. I don't where the hell that storyline is going as of now. And Sam ran off with Gilly and the baby, with Rast swearing to kill him. Everything's gone to hell North of the Wall. Really excited to see where the whole Arya and the Brotherhood things heads as well. Beric Dondarrion said he was gonna fight the Hound, and the look in the Hound's eyes seemed to tell us that Beric was not to be trifled with.
AND MOTHERFUCKING DRACARYS. Daenerys mowed down them motherfuckers. Really glad to see her gain some real power in this episode. That whole scene was badass. Closed off an already fantastic episode. This is definitely a solid 9 from me. It's not a 10, but it's damn close.
365	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-25	I agree with you. It was a great episode but giving 10s this early hm ... I gave it an 8. If episode 04 is like this imagine what is coming, and than the 10s are not the same.I don't think it should matter what number of episode it is to rate it a certain way.
366	Ravi Seaworth	2013-04-26	I agree with you. It was a great episode but giving 10s this early hm ... I gave it an 8. If episode 04 is like this imagine what is coming, and than the 10s are not the same.I believe we won't have such an important episode, in terms of good events, until the RW. That does not mean other episodes can't be really good. I actually enjoyed episode 3 more than this one, because I thought it had a lot of depth in it, with great acting. But, certainly, if they keep with this level, then the show will do justice to ASoS, in my opinion.
367	Songlian	2013-04-26	With great delay, I give it a 10/10, like the majority. There's not much to say. I cried like a baby during the Dany scene. But Mormont's farewell was pretty epic, too. And <3 Sandor.
368	WinterWarrior	2013-04-26	10/10 from me as well. I have been on a business trip all week and watched it in my hotel every night it was on. I LOVE the ending, and particularly tuned in the last 15 minutes or so. Dany came into her own in this episode. I have always loved her and not understood the criticism of her on these boards....and was thrilled to see her finally become be the Queen Conquerer she is. I thought the final shots with her leading the Unsullied out of Astapor were just amazing - epic.
Love it! Can't wait for Sunday!
369	Lyanna Stark	2013-04-27	Ugh, botched BwB scenes, terribly botched Brienne/Jaime scenes (Brienne is a sexist since when??), Theon was a big ??, Varys spilling the beans to the QoT is incomprehensible and makes her seem daft, the Pod thing is a waste of time, Varys, Tyrion and the "sorcerer" in the box was added why? Sansa is now marrying Loras?
It's like someone read the novels and thought they were kinda crap and needed some fanfic editing. /stillsick.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':stillsick:' />
The only saving grace was Dany in Astapor and Mormont, the rest was really a mish mash of botched stuff and irrelevant additions.

I have my worries about Theon's story and how confusing they are, but thought the material here was good overall. Thought the BWB scenes were excellent and seeing as (aside from tweaked dialogue) it was almost exactly the same as the books I fail to see how it was botched.I assume you're referring to the "you sound like a bloody woman" line, in calling Brienne a sexist. I really disagree here, I thought it was quite clear that if Brienne meant anything by her comment it was mocking sexism and Westerosi attitudes towards women.

Everything else about it was terrible too right? Rory as Sandor was brilliant in that BwB scene, and so was Anguy - transforming from witty little outlaw to soldier concerned with the fate of the smallfolk. Why are people so ridiculously dramatic.

373	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-04-27	I really enjoyed it. I thought Jaime was wonderful in his scene. Also really liked the Joff/Marg date through the castle. She has him completely wrapped around her little finger. LOL. Sansa's excited about the Knight of Flowers as well she should be. I also really liked the view of Varys and Tyrion looking down into the crate. Great expressions by Dinklage throughout that scene! And of course, Dracarys was spectacular. I loved the music used and the rhythm of Valerian when spoken by Dany. Also, I always enjoy the QoT but I really hate how they have her scarf wrapped around her head. It makes her look awful.
Finally, the BwB. I was never a fan of the group in the books but I like how they are being visualized on screen. Truly a feeling of Robin Hood and his merry men. Sandor was great in this scene and I look forward to the fight between him and Beric. 
9/10
374	Paul Blackfyre	2013-04-27	A solid 9. The best episode of the season so far.
375	Lyanna Stark	2013-04-27	I assume you're referring to the "you sound like a bloody woman" line, in calling Brienne a sexist. I really disagree here, I thought it was quite clear that if Brienne meant anything by her comment it was mocking sexism and Westerosi attitudes towards women.How is "You sound like a bloody woman" mocking sexism? Explain it to me like I was very, very slow, since it really needs careful explaining to make sense, at all. Unless we're in backwards land, perhaps.I have a feeling that this will be a waste of time, but here I go.1. The pod mention was 30 seconds long.The Pod mention is pointless, has nothing to do with Pod's character and nothing with actual plot. Shitloads of actual plot has been cut, and this has been inserted for what reason? It's not funny, it's not entertaining and it doesn't make any point.2. What is wrong with Sansa marrying Loras?Book!Sansa is offered Willas, a much older cripple who she has not met. She is not offered to marry some handsome dude she fancies. Book!Sansa struggles with Willas as a choice and her disappointment at it not being Loras, but judges that it's still a better offer than being a Lannister pawn and that she will do her utmost to make Willas love her. It's a big step forward in Sansa's character development and denotes her increasing realism. Loras adds nothing of this, it's pointless as far as character development goes.3. Why was the BwB botched?A multitude of reasons which are better placed in the Arya re-read thread as it would need an essay.4. Excluding that single comment by Brienne, why were the Jaime/Brienne scenes botched? Also, not sure the bloody woman comment was a sign of her sexism, more a way of motivating Jaime.Random fight scene instead of the actual dialogue. The bloody woman comment is exactly sexism since Brienne is trying to shame Jaime with comparing him to, that's right, a woman. And book!Brienne does not hate being a woman, she does not say or act in derogatory fashion towards women. A lot of what Brienne's story line deals with is just her struggles because she is a woman. Why is she belittling herself? It makes absolutely no sense.5. What is incomprehensible about the Varys/QoT scene?Varys is not involved in the Sansa plot line at all in ASOS. He does not tell the QoT. If Varys tells her, it makes her look incompetent. In the novels the QoT and the Tyrells figure out themselves that they need to marry Sansa to Willas (not Loras) without having Varys spell out the painfully obvious to them. So on the one hand, the QoT is going on about how men should not rule yada yada, on the other hand, she needs to be hand held by Varys to figure out that Sansa is the next heir to the north, when anyone with half a brain could figure that out. It ruins the QoT's character and makes her seem like a crotchety old woman, not the schemer she is in the novels.6. They cant just have Theon disappear for two seasons, and they need to introduce Ramsay's cruelty and cunning.Oh indeed, but why do it in such a random fashion? Could anyone follow the internal logic in what was going on? My SO has seen the episode twice and he still has no idea what that was all about. I've read the novels more than once, and I have no idea what that was about.

Unless we're in backwards land, perhaps.It's a little something called sarcasm. She's taking the stereotypical sexist views of women in society and turning it against someone she sees as sexist. She's comparing him to a women as you say later in your post, but the male view of a woman, not the reality. You don't have female friends who make "stay in the kitchen" jokes?A multitude of reasons which are better placed in the Arya re-read thread as it would need an essay.I might pop over there to see why exactly one of the most faithful scenes in the episode was botched. Let me guess - Beric wasn't a complete skeleton? His speech wasn't from the books? And people call me unreasonable.

I've read the novels more than once, and I have no idea what that was about.Brienne's lines is twofold. One, she is using Jaime's own devices against him. Two, Brienne clearly has a disdain toward the typical perspective of a Westerosi lady and where they think their place is in the world. This is why she loves Cat, because she is atypical in the sense that she's strong and courageous. Up until the point she swears her service to Cat it seems that Brienne has never met a woman with courage (Other than herself).It's not really hard to piece together. If you think it's sexist it's because they live in an incredibly sexist world.

378	King of the Road	2013-04-27	The Pod mention is pointless, has nothing to do with Pod's character and nothing with actual plot. Shitloads of actual plot has been cut, and this has been inserted for what reason? It's not funny, it's not entertaining and it doesn't make any point.A lot of people think that the Podrick Payne gag is quite funny. It's not supposed to make a point, it's just a little bit of light relief amidst the rest of the dark plotline.I definitely don't agree with you about the Arya meeting the BwB scene being botched. No massive changes there.You haven't said what was incomprehensible about the Varys/QoT, save to say that it wasn't in ASoS, and in your opinion marginally changes the character of Olenna Tyrell. It was a perfectly plausible scheme and scenario.

I've read the novels more than once, and I have no idea what that was about.So it would be better for the show to spend a lot of valuable time, talking about a character who will probably never appear, when they have an actor already on set who doesn't have anything to do? I think you need to understand that this is a TV show.How on earth do you know that Varys didnt tell the QoT anything? Varys knows pretty much every plot in Kingslanding, its not beyond the realm of possibility. Also, she isnt having her hand held, she's being told about LF's plot. Its her idea to marry Loras to SansaThere was absolutely nothing random about the Jaime fight scene. It's also quite similar to the books, as he takes a sword off a guard and is disarmed by Shagwell.The Ramsay thing is meant to be a mystery! Thats the whole point!  What us there not to get if you've read the books? Ramsay is messing with Theon, trying to extract information while also having some sadistic fun. They can easily just reveal who he was later, also revealing Roose Bolton's treachery around the same time.

381	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-04-27	You haven't said what was incomprehensible about the Varys/QoT, save to say that it wasn't in ASoS, and in your opinion marginally changes the character of Olenna Tyrell. It was a perfectly plausible scheme and scenario.I'd say the strangest thing about this is related to the fact that everyone seems to know LF is planning on taking Sansa away. That is not very plausible. Eh, not everyone will like everything. Especially things that make certain favorite characters look poorly or don't allow them to shine like the brilliant innocent star they wish them to be.

It was a perfectly plausible scheme and scenario.The scene doesn't make sense because it creates the plot hole of how on earth LF is going to smuggle Sansa out of KL when quite literally everybody and their grandmother knows what he's up to? Specifically Varys knowing creates a plot hole. Why would he be hell bent on opposing LF's plans for Sansa now, but not be able to track her to the Vale later?
383	Marchefa	2013-04-27	Agreed.  Every non-book reader I know (and they are not dummies either) is totally confused about everything but Dany's story since she is off on her own and her story is more easy to follow.  But they have no clue what is going on with Jon Snow.  No clue who Arya is with.  No clue what Bran is up to.  No idea what anyone in King's Landing is talking about.  No clue who Jaime Lannister is with.  No idea who Theon is with or why he is even there.How can they watch the show and not know the basic things? I understand that they can be a little confused, but I haven't read the books yet and I still understand most of the plot.I think that the confusion is coming from the fact that most of the events that led to the state characters are now in happened in season 2 and they may not remember them clearly.

Specifically Varys knowing creates a plot hole. Why would he be hell bent on opposing LF's plans for Sansa now, but not be able to track her to the Vale later?As far as I can tell, only Ros, Varys, and Olenna know. That's not a lot of people. Substituting Ros for Dontos, that's two more people that know compared to in the books. Two people who keep secrets to further their position.

Like I say, why would Varys oppose LF in manipulating Sansa now, but then just ignore Sansa later? Makes no sense.

But change your comment from "quite literally everybody and their grandmother" to Varys and Olenna if you'd like to be accurate.
	Spoiler My question is, since this whole rivalry between Varys and Littlefinger is show created, is Varys' actual motivations just to spurn Littlefinger? We know he wants to destabilize the Lannisters and thus Westeros in general, but does he truly care that much about LF knowing that he has Aegon in the works and wants Westeros as fucked up as possible to make his conquest successful? In fact, supporting Littlefinger would only strengthen that, since LF is basically creating enmity between the major houses. I think he's just manipulating Olenna into marrying Sansa into their family to create more of a power struggle between the Tyrells and the Lannisters.

Also, its not entirely impossible that LF was planning this the entire time, in order to test Ros's loyalty, and also to put himself beyond suspicion where Sansa is concerned. This way, he gets Sansa, and roots out one of Varys's spies. It's not entirely impossible that the show will have LF outmaneuvering Varys in this way.

Possibly, it could potentially work like that and I hope it does. I really hope that D+D were thinking through the implications of changing a delicate spider's web (if you'll pardon the pun.) and have planned ahead for that rather than just writing the scene for some witty banter. I'm not overly hopeful tbh.

I'm not overly hopeful tbh.I think given what we know about how much planning, reading, and meeting these guys do for character arcs and the overall plot that they would attempt to avoid writing themselves into a corner where they have no choice but to do something so drastic that the plots become too different from the books. I'm somewhat optimistic since these guys know more about George's world than we do. I actually very much dislike their portrayal of Littlefinger thus far, but I think it will play out as I mentioned in the spoiler. Or at least I hope.

The Arya/Tywin scenes, or the Ygritte scenes in S2 for example.

The Arya/Tywin scenes, or the Ygritte scenes in S2 for example.I feel you, and at first I thought why the hell are they doing this with Arya's arc, but watching those two interact was just awesome. I watched an interview with Charles Dance, Thronecast I think, where he's almost speechless about how great Maisie was, and that really pushed me over the edge that sometimes on TV you just need to let brilliant actors interact to make for better television. As long as they don't develop it into a completely different story I'm ok with them do things that are better visually at the expense of book faithfulness.
392	Count Balerion	2013-04-27	The fact that I would have found excellent even without the Daenerys scene at the end speaks for itself.
As someone said, I really like TV Margaery. She has more drive than in the books, I think.
I'm ssaving up my 10s, though.
(Somehow I don't remember the Bran segment. Must have blunked it out.)
393	Golden Dragon	2013-04-28	9/10 
This season just keeps on getting better and better.
394	I love Cersei	2013-04-28	Best of season 3 so far, no doubt about it. Margaery and Joffrey, Sansa and Margaery, Cersei and Tywin - awesome scenes, awesome actors. Lena Headey so very beautiful. And Sophie Turner's best performance ever! Great development in her acting skills since the first season, she was so convincing. She will be one of the big Hollywood stars of the future. Also the scene between Brienne and Jaime worked great, as well as Mormont's death and Dany's scene of course. Rates 9/10, thought long about giving it a 10.
What about the sorcerer in the box - was that in the books? How could I have missed that? Well, even if it wasn't, it adds an interesting touch to Varys' character.
395	Mr Smith	2013-04-29	I see no reason not to give this one a 10: there was nothing about it that I didn't enjoy.
I really liked the fact that we got to see Jaime try to use a sword with his left hand; it made the loss of his sword hand mean more.
Natalie Dormer continues to steal the show this season.
Quite enjoyed the Varys vengeance scene; its interesting that the show continues to make Varys far more likeable than Martin did...
Beric was very well cast.
Astapor was colossal.
396	Marchefa	2013-04-29	With each episode, this season is getting better. I don't know why, but I used to dislike a lot of characters from GoT, but with time I either love them or not care at all. A lot of people pointed out brilliant scenes beetwen Tywin and Cersei, Margaery and Joffrey, Brienne and Jaime. And Varys - of course.
The part I didn't like was Mormont's death scene. He was an important person and his death was so... unmeaningful. I didn't want there to be an hour long speech, but come on...
And Deanarys. So far, I have observed that almost everyone loved that it. To me - it was just cheap and predictable. I didn't believe for a moment that she would sell her dragon for real. It could have been better.

It definitely was a nice touch I'd say.
399	clarkside	2013-05-07	9/10 for me. Anybody who rated this less than 7/10 must surely be trolling /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
400	Englshredwolf	2013-05-11	TBh i gave it a 7 because of the "filler" moments like the queen of thorns and sansa. And varys talking a lot.
401	Rhogantis	2013-05-21	Absolutely loved the end scene, one of my favourite so far. Only 2 odd points, 1: there looked to be wayyy more than 8,000 unsullied in that last scene especially upon marching from the city.. 2: jorah mormont seemed stunned when he heard danaerys speak valyrian... he knew so why so shocked?
402	yomi	2013-08-22	Yes, the Astapor scene was brilliant, I totally loved it.
In general an amazing episode. Only point that really annoyed me was Cat's appearance in Bran's green dream. Why do the show guys hate her so much?
403	Damazama21	2014-04-04	Dany was brilliant in this episode. I also loved Varys, as he got his revenge. 10/10

The question is how far into season 4 will they do the purple wedding? My bet is they'll pad out the first half of the season somewhat, do the purple wedding around episode 6/7 so Tyrion's trial and eventual escape leads us to the privy scene in episode 9? I may be wrong; what does everyone else think?

458	LyannaStargaryen	2013-04-21	I really liked this episode.  ShowDany finally lived up to bookDany, and in arguably her most powerful moment in the series besides the hatching of the dragons.
Poor Theon!
I'm not sure why the Freys haven't been seen or mentioned... All those letters Tywin has been writing, you'd think they'd be mentioned in Riverrun.
I was perplexed at first by the placement of Varys' "I was sliced up by a creep" story, but got its inclusion by the end.  Interesting development, the delivery of the sorcerer.  A gift from Illyrio, perhaps?
No Willas Tyrell: not a huge deal I suppose, but when/how will Loras join the Kingsguard?  Or will it happen under Tommen's reign instead?
Bran's storyline is getting a bit lost in the shuffle: maybe that could use some TV ready tweaks to move along.
Goodbye, LC Mormont.  Hope Edd and Grenn made it out of Craster's alive!
Overall: 8.5/10
459	ebevan91	2013-04-21	The mutiny scene was so tense. I knew it was going to happen and the whole time I was nervous as hell.

462	rcazzy	2013-04-21	Overall, the episode was quite good, especially Dracarys. However,I was a bit sad to not get Jeor Mormont's last words to Sam about wanting Jorah to come home and take the black. Thought he would have stumbled over to him for his last words, however the scene was quite hectic. James Cosmo is a loss for the show even though I knew it had to happen eventually. /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />

I imagine it'll just be sometime after Tyrion and Sansa marry.The dude that plays Loras said that he won't be in armor at all this season, so I'm guessing he'll join the Kingsguard when Tommen is king, because he really only despises Joffrey, right?
469	Sidonie	2013-04-21	This episode was great, a ten out of ten. So much was so good...
1-The crazy, creepy Ramsay reveal
2-Poor Sansa, I almost cried for her when she thought she was going to be marrying Loras
3-Marg manipulating Joff
4-Varys was creepy too, with his mail-order sorcerer
5-Tywin rebuffing Cersei's ambitions
6-Varys and Queen of Thorns-God, I love her
7-And of course, Dany, which actually DID make me cry
470	Pilz	2013-04-21	That was incredible.  Too bad she squanders it all in Mereen.
471	Igziabeher	2013-04-21	Glad to see Owen from Torchwood take out Craster, I was wondering who'd be the one to call him a bastard.
472	Lord Godric	2013-04-21	The dude that plays Loras said that he won't be in armor at all this season, so I'm guessing he'll join the Kingsguard when Tommen is king, because he really only despises Joffrey, right?Hmm..I'm just trying to think how that works for the story.  Does a random Kingsguard member die?  Do they want an extra one after Joffrey is killed? I have a hard time believing that Cersei would want another Tyrell so close to Tommen after Joffrey is killed.  So does Tywin force it to happen?
473	alwayswinter	2013-04-21	but when/how will Loras join the Kingsguard?The Sansa/Loras proposal won't last long, and Tywin may put Loras in the KG specifically to prevent the marriage, then set up Sansa/Tyrion.
474	MMOWarrior	2013-04-21	Not the only one.or two...Gotta save some for next year ya know...
475	Morrigen	2013-04-21	Dracarys rocked!  Go Dany!The Varys/sorcerer interlude gave interesting insight into some of his true motivations.  His antithesis against magic makes me wonder.A side note:  I saw someone on a different forum making a jest about "Four Weddings and a Funeral" during season 3, but this is truly looking plausible.........
476	Trebla	2013-04-21	And a shoutout to the Dance with Dragons with Aegon II feeding his sister to his dragon. Gods, that was a sweet episode. I've been waiting for a Tywin/Cersei scene and it didn't disappoint. He just completely smacked her down. The Craster scene was intense and sad. And the ending. Wow. Beyond what I could have hoped for. Emilia Clarke looked amazing and the CGI  Unsullied ranks looked aweome. DRACARYS!
477	Lord Godric	2013-04-21	I also think a(nother) shout out to the writing for Margaery's expanded character + Natalie Dormer's acting is necessary.  She continues to be just an absolute amazing portrayal.
478	nuno	2013-04-21	What an amazing episode. I still feel bad about the little changes book/show, but loved how they done it.
479	alwayswinter	2013-04-21	Regarding the Varys scene with the sorcerer in a crate, (which possibly was "mailed" by Illyrio). Isn't that pretty much how Tyrion arrives at Illyrio's after fleeing King's Landing? I may be mis-remembering here but i think i recall him being tipped out of a barrell/crate?
480	Mark Antony	2013-04-21	Great episode, Loved pretty much everything.
481	Oakenfist	2013-04-21	Hmm..I'm just trying to think how that works for the story.  Does a random Kingsguard member die?  Do they want an extra one after Joffrey is killed? I have a hard time believing that Cersei would want another Tyrell so close to Tommen after Joffrey is killed.  So does Tywin force it to happen?Well in the first episode Bronn calls one of the KG members "Ser Who's it who" or something like that. Obviously they didn't want to name him so I'm guessing that has something to do with Loras.Plus since the Hound left the KG and Moore was killed in Blackwater that's two open spots.

DRACARYS!Yeah there was a ton of stuff that was just casually dropped into the conversation especially about the Targaryans this episode.
483	MyLittleDirewolf	2013-04-21	When is Sam the Slayer going to happen? It has to be in front of the NW, or it doesn't have the same impact. This is really frustrating me.
484	Darth Pipes	2013-04-21	Hmm..I'm just trying to think how that works for the story.  Does a random Kingsguard member die?  Do they want an extra one after Joffrey is killed? I have a hard time believing that Cersei would want another Tyrell so close to Tommen after Joffrey is killed.  So does Tywin force it to happen?It's possible the Kingsguard positions haven't been filled with the desertion of Sandor and the death of Mandon Moore.  My guess is after the Lannisters break up the Tyrell marriage plot, Loras will be offered the Kingsguard role as a way to eliminate him from future schemes.  Kind of like how Aegon offered Jamie his position in the Kingsguard.  Not wanting to slight the King, Loras will feel compelled to join.
485	Trebla	2013-04-21	I'm loving Twitter right now. People are going Khaleesi Crazy right now. It's pretty cool reading celebrities and sportswriters talking #GoT. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
486	Lannes	2013-04-21	Dracarys! is one of my favorite scenes in all the books and they did it proud tonight.....Great, great scene. /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />
487	Cravensbayne	2013-04-21	Really good. Almost cried a few times. Doesn't make me a wuss..,
488	Khaleesi of Wine	2013-04-21	PERFECT episode. Had goosebumps from beginning to end during Dracarys. It's my favorite scene in ASOS and all through the episode the expectation was killing me, but it was completely met and then some.
Hearing Dany speak High Valyrian was amazing! It sounded sooooo refined.
The final shot with the dragons + Unsullied + Dothraki almost killed me!
I love how they kept so close to the book on the Jaime / Brienne scenes and I feel like they have so so much chemistry. Can't wait for the bear pit.
I was so shocked / excited during Dracarys that while jumping around and squeaking I forgot to watch next week's preview. Gonna rewatch Dracarys over and over now.
489	Mark Antony	2013-04-21	Did Catelyn in Brans dream make everyone else think of Lady Stoneheart?
490	LyannaStargaryen	2013-04-21	The Sansa/Loras proposal won't last long, and Tywin may put Loras in the KG specifically to prevent the marriage, then set up Sansa/Tyrion.That's very possible.  Definitely wont be Cersei masterminding that move.We may not see this until Season 4 then, depending on how they break up the RW and lead up to PW.
491	IMustRememberMyName	2013-04-21	Has anyone replaced the Hound in the KG in the show? Isn't that how it goes in the book or am I thinking of something else?
492	Montey14	2013-04-21	And so Cersei's paranoia begins to unfold....it started with the battle last season...but when she was rebuffed by her father and told she was a dolt.....this is the Cersei of the books.....
493	LyannaStargaryen	2013-04-21	Did Catelyn in Brans dream make everyone else think of Lady Stoneheart?It actually reminded me of Ned-Lyanna, with the repeated "Promise me!"Maybe setting up next episode or two, Reeds telling Bran KoftLT story?
494	adam snow	2013-04-21	I think of Storm of swords as 4 weddings and a funeral.
Red wedding
Imp wedding
Purple wedding
Little Finger wedding
Tully funeral.
495	MyLittleDirewolf	2013-04-21	I really don't think Loras is going to join the KG in the show-verse.  He doesn't have to, for everything else in his arc to happen.
496	Castel	2013-04-21	This is the second episode where Brienne has made a comment about women being weak. The first could be seen as striking at Jaime's pride. Here? Internalized Misogyny? Deliberate? Unfortunate? I'm honestly not sure how I feel about it.
497	Lord Godric	2013-04-21	I'm loving Twitter right now. People are going Khaleesi Crazy right now. It's pretty cool reading celebrities and sportswriters talking #GoT. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />Daenerys Targaryen is trending worldwide!
498	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2013-04-21	As much as I'd love it. I have a sinking feeling we won't get the Knight of the Laughing Tree story in the series. I hope I'm worng, though!
499	Blaer Dayle	2013-04-21	My only complaint for the whole episode is that it was implied that Ros was smarter than Varys since she saw 2 beds on the shipping notice and he didn't. Every time she's onscreen I have more reasons to hate her... other than that I can't complain about anything, this was one of the best episodes of the show yet.
500	billy g.	2013-04-21	Has anyone replaced the Hound in the KG in the show? Isn't that how it goes in the book or am I thinking of something else?The Hound was never Kingsguard.

Deliberate? Unfortunate? I'm honestly not sure how I feel about it.Well I do think it is obviously deliberate as the words are chosen for her.  It was weird to hear her say, but I think it's supposed to be, as you said, some kind of internalized hatred.
502	Rayn	2013-04-21	This episode felt so strong compared to the others, I really think its because they had less skipping around to different storylines and had more screen time for the actors to shine. They need to keep this up.
					
					
							Edited by Rayn, 21 April 2013 - 09:24 PM.
503	Frumpus	2013-04-21	My guess is Loras won't join the KG after all. Seems unimportant when the KG as an entity plays an almost insignificant part in the tv show.
504	Valonqar_	2013-04-21	Great espisode! I started to clapped when it ended and my brothers thought I was some kindo of weirdo.RamsayÂ´s and Daenerys scenes were just fantastic. I got goosebumps. I think that since they are still mentioning PodÂ´s habilities, there is something darker going on there.  (at least I hope so)Did Catelyn in Brans dream make everyone else think of Lady Stoneheart?Exactly my thoughtsHas anyone replaced the Hound in the KG in the show? Isn't that how it goes in the book or am I thinking of something else?I do think thatÂ´s how it happens in the books. And I think Mandon Moore is replaced by one of the Kettlebacks(I never get their names straight)
505	billy g.	2013-04-21	I was looking forward to Dany's Astapor scene since season 1. And now I dread her next few adventures. /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />
506	Oakenfist	2013-04-21	The Hound was never Kingsguard.He was definitely Kingsguard. Both in the books and show.

507	alwayswinter	2013-04-21	Did Catelyn in Brans dream make everyone else think of Lady Stoneheart?My thoughts exactly, there was definitely something up with her eyes!
508	Israel	2013-04-21	Did anyone else notice that comment Cercei made to Tywin " Perhaps you should try  stoppong from doing what he likes"  " I  will" ?  Is Cersei giving Tywin permission to kill Joffrey.  Has this been discussed?
509	Prince of Dragonstone	2013-04-21	Dany's dracarys moment was more magnificent than I could even imagine. I love the whole scope and scale of that scene. "Epic" doesn't do it justice. The Unsullied are ON POINT, btw.
510	TheMountianNick	2013-04-21	Does anyone else think that we won't see The Mountain this season?  Sort of hoping that is the case, and Conan Stevens comes back next season to duel it out with the Red Viper
511	LyannaStargaryen	2013-04-21	Did anyone else notice that comment Cercei made to Tywin " Perhaps you should try  stoppong from doing what he likes"  " I  will" ?  Is Cersei giving Tywin permission to kill Joffrey.  Has this been discussed?I thought they were foreshadowing the showdown between Tywin and Joffrey, when Joff answers back and says that Robert won all the battles and Tywin was hiding during the Rebellion.  Or some variation of that we will see in the tv show.
512	towerofjoy	2013-04-21	The Hound was never Kingsguard.Actually he was, remember he replaced Barristan in the 1st season and covered up Sansa with his white cloak in the 2nd when Joff was having her stripped and beaten.
513	Khaleesi of Wine	2013-04-21	Did Catelyn in Brans dream make everyone else think of Lady Stoneheart?I thought I was the only one!
514	axels15	2013-04-21	I can't see anyway the Purple Wedding happens in this season. There's only six more episodes and so much more to happen!? How can anyone actually believe they're doing both?
515	MyLittleDirewolf	2013-04-21	Did anyone else notice that comment Cercei made to Tywin " Perhaps you should try  stoppong from doing what he likes"  " I  will" ?  Is Cersei giving Tywin permission to kill Joffrey.  Has this been discussed?I took it like Cersei: "You try controlling him. Good luck with that." Tywin: "Damn straight I will." (interpret that to mean being in on the PW?)
516	MyLittleDirewolf	2013-04-21	I can't see anyway the Purple Wedding happens in this season. There's only six more episodes and so much more to happen!? How can anyone actually believe they're doing both?Not to get bogged down in another Is the PW this season debate, but my feeling is that they are setting it up so show-watchers thing the Joffery/Marg wedding is coming, but then it's Sansa/Tyrion.
517	Khaleesi of Wine	2013-04-21	I was looking forward to Dany's Astapor scene since season 1. And now I dread her next few adventures. /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' /> What! Nooo. We still have to see her outsmarting a bunch of battle commanders in Yunkai!

Sorry, didn't realize this was even a debate, lol, I'll check the other threads.Anyway, loved the episode! 10 for me.
519	congokong	2013-04-21	All the scenes could be cut out up until the scene where Craster dies. After that it was all pretty good.

520	Nuncle Kraken	2013-04-21	Wow.
521	adamsputnik	2013-04-21	I took it like Cersei: "You try controlling him. Good luck with that." Tywin: "Damn straight I will." (interpret that to mean being in on the PW?)I take it on its face. We know Tywin is a bloke no one will mess with. So if Joffrey needs to be taken in hand, then Tywin will do it. I didn't read anything more into it.
522	Lady Lea	2013-04-21	I can't believe they carried on with that Podrick joke. For fuck's sake.
"You sound like a bloody woman!" well, Brienne was never this sexist in the books tbh.
Overall though, best episode of the series so far. Excelent Dany and Marg scenes. I LOVED how giddy Joffrey was.
523	MyLittleDirewolf	2013-04-21	Did Edd get stabbed at the mutiny? I hope not! We need to have "Edd, fetch me a block."
524	go joff go	2013-04-21	I took it like Cersei: "You try controlling him. Good luck with that." Tywin: "Damn straight I will." (interpret that to mean being in on the PW?)I think you can take it either way.  I mean the who killed Joffrey is a big angle in the PW and so far Tyrion, Margaery, QOT, and now Tywin have all said something that could be construed as I will kill him if I have to.
525	IMustRememberMyName	2013-04-21	The Hound was never Kingsguard.Maybe not in the show but in the book he was. His blood spattered white cloak is a part of the whole SanSan fling. Besides, it would take a nudge from Margaery and a line from Joffery to make it so and the world can move forward.
526	Lady Lea	2013-04-21	Does anyone know exactly what they are going for involving Varys in the PW?? I mean, what?
And I was sad about no Willas mention. It would have been a good scene.
527	MyLittleDirewolf	2013-04-21	I think you can take it either way.  I mean the who killed Joffrey is a big angle in the PW and so far Tyrion, Margaery, QOT, and now Tywin have all said something that could be construed as I will kill him if I have to.I've actually never thought Tywin was in on the PW, but that scene gave me pause.
528	vectner	2013-04-21	The Hound had a white cloak he put it around Sansa when she had her dress ripped off.
529	Lady Lea	2013-04-21	heh. Tywin referring to Jaime as his heir. Nice.
530	LyannaStargaryen	2013-04-21	I can't believe they carried on with that Podrick joke. For fuck's sake."You sound like a bloody woman!" well, Brienne was never this sexist in the books tbh.Overall though, best episode of the series so far. Excelent Dany and Marg scenes. I LOVED how giddy Joffrey was.The most bizarre and vaguely gruesome courtship ever.  But Dormer does a great job as a more skilled, stronger Marg than the books, and I almost like watching Joffrey interact with her.  And then I want to feverishly re-read the books where I dislike everything Joffrey says, does, is.  But it's a true credit to Gleeson and Dormer.
531	Prince of Dragonstone	2013-04-21	Can't wait for Joffrey vs Tywin scene. It was such a great little moment in the book. 
Iwan Rheon will do great as Ramsay. He's bringing just the right level of creepiness to the role. I love that we get to see the set-up of Theon becoming Reek.
532	King of the Wall	2013-04-21	Did anyone else notice that comment Cercei made to Tywin " Perhaps you should try  stoppong from doing what he likes"  " I  will" ?

534	Lord Godric	2013-04-21	Does anyone know exactly what they are going for involving Varys in the PW?? I mean, what?I don't think Varys is involved in the PW.  I thought he was just planting the seed of having Sansa marry Loras in Olenna head.

They will just need to CG the hell out of Ian Whyte so he actually looks menacing in that duel.

543	Blaer Dayle	2013-04-21	Why do the writers feel the need to embellish Ros so much? Not only did she have to continue that Pod joke that was chuckle-worthy at best the first time round, but they also imply she's smarter than Varys. She sees that Littlefinger booked two beds and Varys, the MASTER OF WHISPERS, whose job it is to see the things that others don't, can't, without her to point it out to him? It's a bit much.

Are we going to find out she's been a spy all along, or she's some noble's daughter in hiding? Whores don't know how to read!
548	Ampris	2013-04-21	Okay list of observations and differences -1) I don't remember Varys saying he would fight the Red Priestess specifically just magic.2) Also, I am very curious as to what the storyline will be (if any) with his revenge on the sorcerer. One of my personal theories was that when the books revealed more about Varys we'd have more of an answer to his motivations so the show may have just kissed that bye bye...3) lol at the QoT foreshadowing the PW with her "sons yearning for the grave" line - Cersei's face was hilarious4) I wish I knew where they were going letting it leak that Bran and Rickon might be alive. Theon telling the Bastard about the miller's sons? Ugh. This is one change I haven't approved of since Robb heard the news. But I'll wait and see what is gonna come of it.5) I wanted to cry when Theon said "My real father lost his head at King's Landing." GRRM does a good job of making you pity Theon but that line did more than anything in the books.6) Brienne saying "You sound like a bloody woman!" hilar7) Tywin telling Cersei "I wish YOU knew how to manipulate him."8) The QoT flirting with Varys. "Are you here to seduce me?" "What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?" Favorite line of the series so far.9) Margaery and the pigface and porridge plague stories. Sansa's reaction was perfect - about time she showed something this season.10) Do not approve of her being changed to marry Loras instead of Willas even though many predicted that was where this was going. Part of her disillusionment is realizing she can't have that perfect knight.11) I knew it was coming but Lord Mormont dying still really got to me =(12) What did they do to Beric? He's supposed to be like 22, not grey haired and balding.13) And The Hound demanding trial by combat was his way of one-upping the BWB. Doesn't make a huge difference that he was "sentenced" to it instead but eh. Not a change I like.But all in all... I thought this was the best episode of the season so far.

I can't help but to read into the obvious foreshadowing DD are doing for books 6 and 7. I wish they wouldn't, I don't want them spoiled /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
But it make me think about the whole mummer's dragon situation.. and the fact that magic has come back since dragons have returned.. ok, I'm sidetracking here.
GREAT episode. Dany was as hot as dracarys! Not one thing I would have changed about that scene. Just amazing. How there's information on learning dothraki, I hope they put some out there on Valyrian! I can't wait for Daario!
one poster mentioned that they wished they would have included LC's last wish of having his son join the NW and I agree. I wonder if the viewers even know that Jorah is Jeor's son. My bf surely did not!
I was kind of waiting for Tywin to tell Cersei that she is to remarry. It would have been the perfect time to include that then. Charles Dance is just an aboluste gem on the show, some of the finest acting I've ever seen.
Why are we still talking about Pod's Package? It makes me think that there's something more to it, the way they keep beating this dead horse. We get it!
Feeling sorry for Theon! Is it just gonna be him being tortured for the next few seasons until he goes to treat with Moat Cailin? I hope they find something else for him. I don't usually like it when they make up material but they totally can in this case!
That ONE Bran scene was random and short. I didn't think much of Lady Stoneheart in that scene until I came here and everyone said that's what they were thinking.
Oh, Dany <3
552	LyannaStargaryen	2013-04-21	Also, how can she read??? For real, did she learn by osmosis??Love this.
553	SerMixalot	2013-04-21	My only problem with the episode is the continue character assassination of Littlefinger.  Now Varys, Ros, Shae AND the QoT will now where Sansa is after the PW.
554	Lord Twat-Beard	2013-04-21	Favorite episode of the series yet. Theon calling Ned his true father was interesting. The QoT continues to be amazing. Dracarys was everything I hoped it would be and so much more.
555	Ser_Patreck	2013-04-21	Why do the writers feel the need to embellish Ros so much? Not only did she have to continue that Pod joke that was chuckle-worthy at best the first time round, but they also imply she's smarter than Varys. She sees that Littlefinger booked two beds and Varys, the MASTER OF WHISPERS, whose job it is to see the things that others don't, can't, without her to point it out to him? It's a bit much. Every scene she has I come to loathe her a little moreYeah. It's not like Varys could be feigning ignorance to see if she really could read or was just handing him what she heard was the ship's cargo. Or feigning ignorance to see if she was capable. Or feigning just for shits and giggles.I mean, I understand disliking a character, but damn...Theon's confession about Ned being his true father moved me. We can kinda get it from him in aDwD, especiallly down the crypts, but listening to him actually speaking that... That was powerful.And I gotta love Olenna parroting fan's opinions of the Tyrells' motto... Unless that scene was in the book and I can't recall it...EDIT: Oh, and also... "I don't mistrust you because you're a woman... I mistrust you for thinking you're much smarter than you actually are" (Or something like this). Best line so far. Almost a "Take That". Yes, Tywin. You're a bastard, but sometimes, you tell it exactly as it is.

556	Lady Lea	2013-04-21	UNLESS, she doesn't know how to read and LF gave her that piece of paper and told her what to say. That would make more sense. She's a double agent after all. Aha!
557	Forgottenire	2013-04-21	I personally like Ros. I think Varys was playing her in that scene to see just how much she knew. Playing dumb is always the best way to get people to talk more than they normally would.
558	Lany Cassandra	2013-04-21	I wonder what to make of Varys's scene with Tyrion. He says he hates magic, but in the books, isn't he always doing magic to disguise himself?He uses costumes and makeup to diguise himself, never magic, that I recall.
559	Warden of the North121	2013-04-21	My only problem with the episode is the continue character assassination of Littlefinger.  Now Varys, Ros, Shae AND the QoT will now where Sansa is after the PW.This is a good point. Hopefully Ros and Shae will be dead by then though lol.
560	Castel	2013-04-21	Well I do think it is obviously deliberate as the words are chosen for her.  It was weird to hear her say, but I think it's supposed to be, as you said, some kind of internalized hatred.Well, it is deliberate, I just don't know if she believes them like Cersei or she thinks they'll get through to Jaime. The former seems more realistic but I'm torn.
561	The Unborn	2013-04-21	When is Sam the Slayer going to happen? It has to be in front of the NW, or it doesn't have the same impact. This is really frustrating me.To be honest I didn't even remember that he killed an Other in front of the NW. But probably Grenn / Ed will witness the slayer in action.
562	Lord of Netcong	2013-04-21	Okay list of observations and differences -1) I don't remember Varys saying he would fight the Red Priestess specifically just magic.2) Also, I am very curious as to what the storyline will be (if any) with his revenge on the sorcerer. One of my personal theories was that when the books revealed more about Varys we'd have more of an answer to his motivations so the show may have just kissed that bye bye...3) lol at the QoT foreshadowing the PW with her "sons yearning for the grave" line - Cersei's face was hilarious4) I wish I knew where they were going letting it leak that Bran and Rickon might be alive. Theon telling the Bastard about the miller's sons? Ugh. This is one change I haven't approved of since Robb heard the news. But I'll wait and see what is gonna come of it.5) I wanted to cry when Theon said "My real father lost his head at King's Landing." GRRM does a good job of making you pity Theon but that line did more than anything in the books.6) Brienne saying "You sound like a bloody woman!" hilar7) Tywin telling Cersei "I wish YOU knew how to manipulate him."8) The QoT flirting with Varys. "Are you here to seduce me?" "What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?" Favorite line of the series so far.9) Margaery and the pigface and porridge plague stories. Sansa's reaction was perfect - about time she showed something this season.10) Do not approve of her being changed to marry Loras instead of Willas even though many predicted that was where this was going. Part of her disillusionment is realizing she can't have that perfect knight.11) I knew it was coming but Lord Mormont dying still really got to me =(12) What did they do to Beric? He's supposed to be like 22, not grey haired and balding.13) And The Hound demanding trial by combat was his way of one-upping the BWB. Doesn't make a huge difference that he was "sentenced" to it instead but eh. Not a change I like.But all in all... I thought this was the best episode of the season so far.#4 isn't really a change. In ADWD Roose and Ramsay have an agruement where part of it is about the Stark boys. Roose basically says "what if they happen to show up". The knowledge is there so the fact they put that in Theon/Ramsey story shouldn't change much.#12 Beric looks terrible because he has been brought back to life several times at this point. The wounds don't heal, he just comes back to life. In the book he was described as being pretty much mangled.
563	Lany Cassandra	2013-04-21	My only problem with the episode is the continue character assassination of Littlefinger.  Now Varys, Ros, Shae AND the QoT will now where Sansa is after the PW.Not really.  Littlefinger is leaving NOW, and Sansa will still be there for a long time after he is gone. They will think it was for someone else.
564	SerMixalot	2013-04-21	Not really.  Littlefinger is leaving NOW, and Sansa will still be there for a long time after he is gone. They will think it was for someone else.nonsense that is what Varys, Ros and QoT were talking about through the entire episode.  It is horrible that half of KL knows what LF is up to.

Every scene she has I come to loathe her a little moreIt may have been just me, but watching that scene I saw it as Varys playing dumb to make Ros feel smart. Even if he wasn't, he is smart cause he gets his info from his little spiders. Ros is now one of his spiders.
566	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-21	What the hell was up with that Varys scene?
567	Ser_Patreck	2013-04-21	Not really.  Littlefinger is leaving NOW, and Sansa will still be there for a long time after he is gone. They will think it was for someone else.This. And frankly, if they did knew by the time everything's going down, what could they do? Besiege the Vale?
568	ebevan91	2013-04-21	nonsense that is what Varys, Ros and QoT were talking about through the entire episode.  It is horrible that half of KL knows what LF is up to.Did I miss something? I swear I never saw Ros in this episode. I had to go do something at the beginning of the Bran scene but came back within like 2 minutes. Did they show her after his scene?

I thought this was the best episode of the season so far.I think this works even better.  They just got her hopes up for the best possible thing and they will come crushing down on her when she has to marry Tyrion.Plus they don't have to introduce another character for the show.I was just talking to my sister-in-law who started watching since they are taping it for me and she had no idea that Stannis, Robert, and Renly were all brothers.
570	Oakenfist	2013-04-21	Willas was mentioned last episode but for simplicity sake it makes more sense to switch with Loras for the marriage rather than have another character off screen.
571	jobmartell	2013-04-21	Tywin writing to frey? Scene with varys and tyrion, varys says to the effect that tyrion doesn't have the pull to find out who/why he was almost murdered, YET. Possible foreshadowing?  Anyone else or I'm stretching?
572	wolverine	2013-04-21	Did I miss something? I swear I never saw Ros in this episode. I had to go do something at the beginning of the Bran scene but came back within like 2 minutes. Did they show her after his scene?She had a scene where she was informing Varys, her tits weren't hanging out so maybe you didn't recognize her.
573	Lady Lea	2013-04-21	I think this works even better.  They just got her hopes up for the best possible thing and they will come crushing down on her when she has to marry Tyrion.Plus they don't have to introduce another character for the show.I was just talking to my sister-in-law who started watching since they are taping it for me and she had no idea that Stannis, Robert, and Renly were all brothers.ahh I guess you're right about Willas.and lol to be fair they really don't look much alike in the show
574	Minsc	2013-04-21	I think this works even better.  They just got her hopes up for the best possible thing and they will come crushing down on her when she has to marry Tyrion.Only now this is going to be used to further the cries of how Sansa is some terrible shallow @#4? when she doesn't love Tyrion, while also throwing out cries that she is just stupid as she doesn't realize that Loros is gay.
575	Lady Lea	2013-04-21	Only now this is going to be used to further the cries of how Sansa is some terrible shallow @#4? when she doesn't love Tyrion, while also throwing out cries that she is just stupid as she doesn't realize that Loros is gay.especially since they already did a scene about how much Tyrion just wants to help her.Such a selfless humanitarian.
576	pinkie10	2013-04-21	Varys, Ros, and Shae all think Littlefinger will be taking Sansa with him to the Vale when he leaves shortly. None of them will suspect that he would come back months later on the night of the PW just to pick her up. Olenna already knows what Littlefinger is doing obviously. Shae dies so who cares. Ros doesn't actually exist and will probably be killed off soon because what is she going to do without Littlefinger in King's Landing? Littlefinger's plans are safe with Varys, who doesn't know his real plans at all. Varys and Littlefinger run Westeros.

Ros doesn't actually exist and will probably be killed off soon because what is she going to do without Littlefinger in King's Landing?I was just thinking that LF will kill her off like he did with Dontos. She'll help smuggle Sansa and bam! murdered.
579	Ser Steven	2013-04-21	nonsense that is what Varys, Ros and QoT were talking about through the entire episode.  It is horrible that half of KL knows what LF is up to.No they were talking about LF taking Sansa with him when he went to try to talk Lysa into marrying him. Which for the most part, his plans were foiled by having Sansa marry Loras, so she can't leave for the Vale, at least according to Varys and QoT.
580	Minsc	2013-04-21	I know what kind of shallow bitch doesn't love a twisted perverted member of a family who murdered her father and many of her friends, wars with her brother, and holds her captive?I am not arguing that, instead I am mentioning about how that quite likely will be the reaction by a number of fans.  Moreover, there is the issue of how Loros being so obviously gay drops the tragedy that Sansa might have found someone who could actually love her in regards to that plot.
581	Ampris	2013-04-21	1. I agree about the nonexistent line....lol2. Considering Beric's been killed and resurrected like 6 or 7 times I doubt he would look like much a looker anymore.#4 isn't really a change. In ADWD Roose and Ramsay have an agruement where part of it is about the Stark boys. Roose basically says "what if they happen to show up". The knowledge is there so the fact they put that in Theon/Ramsey story shouldn't change much.#12 Beric looks terrible because he has been brought back to life several times at this point. The wounds don't heal, he just comes back to life. In the book he was described as being pretty much mangled.I understand that he's unBeric, but that wouldn't actually turn someone's hair grey or make him bald. He would just be reanimated as he was but with all his nasty fatal wounds. In terms of physical health he looked much better than I expected. But he looked damn old.
582	Soiled Septa	2013-04-21	"Promise me?"I hope this is foreshadowing!
583	wolverine	2013-04-21	I was just thinking that LF will kill her off like he did with Dontos. She'll help smuggle Sansa and bam! murdered.That would work pretty well if he knows she is reporting to Varys.

Moreover, there is the issue of how Loros being so obviously gay drops the tragedy that Sansa might have found someone who could actually love her in regards to that plot.Yea.  It would help if they didn't make Tyrion SOOOOOOOOOOO much more lovable in the show.
585	King of the Wall	2013-04-21	I was just thinking that LF will kill her off like he did with Dontos. She'll help smuggle Sansa and bam! murdered. Wouldn't that be lovely? It would be good to show how cold LF can be.

Moreover, there is the issue of how Loros being so obviously gay drops the tragedy that Sansa might have found someone who could actually love her in regards to that plot.I don't really expect such a strong anti Sansa reaction.  They are laying down the foundation that all anyone cares about is her claim to Winterfell. The observant TV viewers will know that she's just as much of a hostage as she's been since the end of season 1.
587	teemo	2013-04-21	Ros is such a prodigy...my new fave char /wub.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':wub:' /> why did GRRM never create such a clever whore who can read?

596	Ser_Patreck	2013-04-21	naaa red wedding should be the finale of this season and purple wedding should be mid-to end episode of the next season with tyrion killing tywin the end of next seasonI dunno. I think a Red Wedding without a comparable setback to the "bad guys" would be quite the hard pill to swallow to people who didn't read the books. I wouldn't take the chance to potentially turn a sizable part of the viewership off the series...
597	Winterz	2013-04-21	This episode sure did have its loads of deviations but I think they made perfectly sense and loved how they finally started using past references. Plenty of concepts introduced this episode.
Related to Theon and Boy, so that castle we see from the outside, it's just another angle of the Dreadfort as it is portrayed in the show, right?
Loved the revelations and foreshadowing development. This episode was just too great.
I think the only thing I'd like improved would be Ramsay revealing his true name and acts, an even bigger shock on Theon's face would just be too amusing!

600	teemo	2013-04-21	He did. Remember Varys always employs children because they are small and can fit in places adults can't.He would also teach them to read. Children grow up.yep. it's a good thing he taught ros to read. fleshes her out a lot more.

How will that change the story?To be fair didn't they know that already in the books?  Seeing how Ramsey was the one who convinced Theon to kill the Miller's Children instead.

Is it just because she's not in the books or what? Me neither. I'd argue that just book reader zealotry about a new character that wasn't in the original series (See also: Talisa), but there seems to be something else going on.

605	Forgottenire	2013-04-21	oh I se the sarcasm. Like I posted before, I like Ros but wouldn't be sad to see her go. In truth she has probably sstayed as long as she has because she is willing to go nekked.
606	teemo	2013-04-21	I love how LF threatened the shit out of Ros for being a "bad whore" and now he's just "too distracted" to care about four whores not charging a virgin because he is OMGANAMAZINGLOVER. yes, I'm sure there have been a lot of whores in history, not one, not two...but 4 that agree together to turn down a client's money.
607	Ser_Patreck	2013-04-21	okay i see your point. but tywin's death at tyrions hand is definitely season finale material so i cant see his trial go on for a whole seasonI don't think it's quite season finale material. My money would be on the battle at the Wall. Even if it is, tough, I can quite see his trial going for a whole season. I mean, one hour is barely enough to move all plotlines simultaneously. Actually, scrap the barely - it just isn't. What did we see of Jon and Robb today? Naught. On S04, Dorne and the Iron Islands come in (Hopefully). I dunno, I see things moving in a considerably slower pace.
608	Lord Godric	2013-04-21	I know someone suggested earlier that Varys was talking to Olenna about planning the PW, and I don't think that's the case.  But what I do wonder is why sow the seed of not trusting Littlefinger knowing that Olenna (at least in the books) works with him later on.
609	Blaer Dayle	2013-04-21	yes, i was being sarcastic with rage. i think the idea of LF killing her is a good one.Thank the Gods, I thought I was dealing with an insane person here. Nice avatar by the way, I love Chrono Trigger /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' /> I'll never understand the amount of sheer rage that unremarkable Ros generates. Is it just because she's not in the books or what?For me it's because she's a Mary Sue of sorts, the whore who comes from nothing, accomplishes everything she could ever want, do things she could never possible do in a realistic world (like reading), thus reducing the beleivability of the realistic world George created, reduces the image of other characters, like Littlefinger and Varys by always having some clever insight into their character (knowing that LF can't be trusted) or knowing something they don't (seeing that LF booked 2 beds when Varys didn't), and all this from a character who shouldn't be taking up screen time that could be used to get more plot from the books that is cut to save time, simply because D&D want to place their stamp on the universe regardless of what fans think. That is why I hate Ros so much.Me neither. I'd argue that just book reader zealotry about a new character that wasn't in the original series (See also: Talisa), but there seems to be something else going on.See the above. And to be fair I like Talisa. I would have liked to see Jeyne Westerling, but Talisa is fine as well since she is at least based on something from the books, has a reason to be around Robb and fall in love with him being a nurse on the battlefields  and actually serves a useful part in the plot without diminishing other characters.

610	Dubbs	2013-04-21	I may be completely off here, but did Tywin just imply to Ceresi he may have a part in the purple wedding? He said something along the lines of how he will control Joff, and then it cuts to a scene with the QoT who obviously plays a huge part in it...
Perhaps this would also be a way for him to pin this on his son and get Tyrion out of the picture as well?

It was simply Cersei saying "He's uncontrollable, see for yourself" and Tywin answering "Oh, I do intend to".
613	Ampris	2013-04-21	I think people are reading too much into it. It was simply Cersei saying "He's uncontrollable, see for yourself" and Tywin answering "Oh, I do intend to".I kind of took it as Tywin will be stepping in to curb Joff in the show as Tyrion did to some extent in the books. Correct me if I'm wrong but the only thing I remember Tyrion doing is slapping him at Winterfell.
614	Dove	2013-04-21	I really, really can't wait for the inevitable Tywin and Joff "check yourself before you wreck yourself" scene, it's going to be amazing
615	Lady Lea	2013-04-21	Did D&D write this ep?
616	Janicia	2013-04-21	I thought Brienneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s comment was a deliberate reference to their previous conversation.  Jaime said something about â<U+0080><U+009C>thank the Gods Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not a womanâ<U+0080><U+009D> and she called his behavior cowardly and womanly in an attempt to goad him into survival.  I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think Brienneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s words here should be taken as her opinions on womanhood; sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s obviously saying what she thinks Jaime needs to hear. 
I wonder if Varys sorcerer is somehow going to be related to Qyburnâ<U+0080><U+0099>s plotline?  I like that theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re keeping the Varys / LF rivalry alive.  Seemed like Olenna got the best of Varys, think thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the first time somebody has flummoed him.  Theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re changing around motivations and simplifying plots here, but keeping the snakes nest aspect to Kings Landing, which seems important to me.  
I was sure that Podâ<U+0080><U+0099>s â<U+0080><U+009C>prowessâ<U+0080><U+009D> was an arrangement between Tyrion and the whores, but I guess not?  Weird.
In the book, Tywin was contemplating giving Joffrey a sharp lesson at about this time, which Tyrion interpreted as something on the level of Tyshaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s gang rape.  I think TV Tywinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s comment was intended in that light, though I imagine they donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want it to be immediately obvious who is behind PW.  That actually might be interesting â<U+0080><U+0093> in the book we immediately know from Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s POV that heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s innocent, but that might be unclear in TV.  Could be interesting if we think Tyrion did actually do it for a bit.
Ros had time to study the manifesto; Varys glanced at it for 5 seconds.  Donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t hate on Ros!  Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll probably be dead in some gruesome way soon anyway.
617	Magic 8 Ball	2013-04-21	So we can now confirm that Marwyn was not the one who "unmanned" Varys, provided D&D weren't deviating from the script there.
(sounds stupid but it's been bandied around on general)
618	Lord Godric	2013-04-21	Me neither. I'd argue that just book reader zealotry about a new character that wasn't in the original series (See also: Talisa), but there seems to be something else going on.When I actually saw people giving reasons for hating Roz they were just book reader zealotry. That she was taking up too much time from real characters and stuff like that. I don't think it has exactly changed, but people have stopped even bothering to supply reasons because "UGH, it's Roz"
619	Ampris	2013-04-21	So we can now confirm that Marwyn was not the one who "unmanned" Varys, provided D&D weren't deviating from the script there.(sounds stupid but it's been bandied around on general)I had to look up who Marwyn was. And even after I read the wiki I still only dimly recall this character.
620	teemo	2013-04-21	Um, no.  Ros is awful and a plot device for flat-out lazy writing.  She is completely unrealistic for a woman of "those times" and her whole double-agent role is ludicrous.  Her "moving up in the world" as Littlefinger's Hand of the Pimp makes no sense.
621	niA±ostark	2013-04-21	I am what most of people would call a "purist"

Just had to write that down

623	Ser_Patreck	2013-04-21	It completely baffles me that people take "Double Agent Ros" and "I Can't See It, Show It To Me" Varys at face value.
624	TheMaidenFair	2013-04-21	The scene with Dany was awesome! Just how I wanted it to happen. That's the one scene I've been waiting for throughout the entire series.
Bran's scene was kind of lost...
Enjoyed the Theon scene.
I was sad Willis was omitted. 
Loved the Tyrell ladies.
Awesome episode over all!
625	Triskan	2013-04-21	For a second there I thought we were maybe going to get the Beric v. Sandor duel. 
The final Dany scene was absolutely incredible.  I could not be more satisfied. 
The Margaery scenes that they'd added are great examples of scenes that weren't in the books but totally lend themselves to the overall thrust like playing on Cercei's paranoia and jealousy and Sansa's hopes.  Dormer is an astoundingly good actress.  What a casting boon.  I liked her well enough in The Tudors, but she is just owning every moment in this show.
626	Ser_Patreck	2013-04-21	Bran's storyline is kind of muddled up in the series, yeah... But I kinda like the way they make him and Jojen interact in the "Dream World". It's nice.
627	Kasrith	2013-04-21	I, once again, really liked the little things. Like the "Promise Me" Stark dream; albeit different characters and absolutely dif context, it is SUCH a nod to the whole Lyanna backstory through Bran theory.Sansa praying outside in nature as opposed to the sept almost makes up for Robb's vows to the Seven during the wedding last season. Almost.Varys: Proof? Will there be a trial? *snickers*. So so many trials...Random notes-everything Tywin-Theon: talking about his inner conflict/troubles, poor poor Theon-The Hound/Beric: the entire scene was brilliant, can't even pick out one bit worth mentioning-Jaime: whether it was the opening blank stare scene, the conversation with Brienne, or him trying to fight with his left hand, perfect delivery-Cat

628	MoA«t	2013-04-21	This is the second episode where Brienne has made a comment about women being weak. The first could be seen as striking at Jaime's pride. Here? Internalized Misogyny? Deliberate? Unfortunate? I'm honestly not sure how I feel about it.I don't think it's misogyny at all. Brienne, like Cersei, hates the role that the world has forced on women, but unlike Cersei, has refused that role full stop. Cersei has embraced it and tried to use it to her advantage. "A women's greatest weapon is between her legs. Learn how to use it."I can't get over Theon. "My real father lost his head in King's Landing." HFS that was awesome.Yes, Tywin is writing letters. No, we haven't seen the Frey's yet, since they haven't received those letters. Yet.

629	Kasrith	2013-04-21	"Promise me?"So much yes... Bran's World Weirwood Web is totally going to tap into the actual "Promise me" bit
630	Zman1863	2013-04-21	Was not really a fan of the last NW scene. Something about it seemed a little too quick and chaotic.
631	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-21	Actually he was, remember he replaced Barristan in the 1st season and covered up Sansa with his white cloak in the 2nd when Joff was having her stripped and beaten.The Hound was a member of the KG in the books, but not in the show. In season 1 Joffrey dismissed Barristan from the KG, but never said that Sandor would take his place. In season 2 Sandor gives his cloak to Sansa, but even though it was white, it was just his cloak, not a KG cloak because if you pay attention, through out the whole season 2 he never wears the KG armor.
632	Frumpus	2013-04-21	Pretty sure Sandor was made KG, but even if he wasn't, it does not matter, as they are clearly not making a big deal about the kingsguard rules on the show.
It's just like how the Kettlebacks were removed from the show. Who knows if Balon Swann ever gets used. I think many KG characters will be replaced or plotlines that require them changed.
633	Winterfellian	2013-04-21	The Hound was a member of the KG in the books, but not in the show. In season 1 Joffrey dismissed Barristan from the KG, but never said that Sandor would take his place. In season 2 Sandor gives his cloak to Sansa, but even though it was white, it was just his cloak, not a KG cloak because if you pay attention, through out the whole season 2 he never wears the KG armor.Wrong. In the Blackwater episode Tyrion directly told the Hound "you're kingsguard Clegane" when he was trying to coax him to engaged in another sortie. So it IS pretty clear that the Hound was indeed a member of Joffrey's KG

Her "moving up in the world" as Littlefinger's Hand of the Pimp makes no sense.Her character is way more realistic than Brienne or Arya.  Where's the hate for them?And who cares if she wasn't in the books?  There were a lot of whores in the books that aren't in the show, like Chataya, Alayaya, etc.  She serves a purpose.
635	Ampris	2013-04-21	Was not really a fan of the last NW scene. Something about it seemed a little too quick and chaotic.Plus STILL no Sam the Slayer =(

Their celibacy and inability to inherit drives quite a few important plot lines, especially with respect to the Lannisters and Casterly Rock. Same with the fact that a queen has to be defended by a KG in a trial by combat - that moment when Jaime burns Cersei's letter is a huge turning point. Not to mention the whole "for life" thing - which is why Selmy's dismissal is supposed to be so shocking and the whole Robert the Strong storyline.
638	Newstar	2013-04-21	Dany was amazing. It's all downhill from here for her, but that was awesome.
Funny that the Hound hasn't mentioned Sansa yet. It seemed like the bit with Sansa confirming that Mycah had attacked Joffrey would be mentioned by the Hound, as he did in the books. Seems odd.
Looks like the Tyrion/Sansa engagement will come up in 3x05 (Tywin mentioning a "plot" where they need to act first sounds like what Tywin said in the books where he broached the issue, and there was a quick cut to Sansa in the promo after this in case we were in any doubt on the subject), but the wedding isn't until 3x08. Seems like a big lag for wedding planning, especially since the synopses for 3x06-3x07 allude to wedding-related stuff. I seem to recall the Tywin/Tyrion/Cersei conversation and the wedding proper being really close together in the books. Is Sansa going to be flitting around blissfully unaware for the next three episodes? Or will she have some warning?
So, who leaks the news of the Loras/Sansa match? Tyrion, on information from Shae? We know from 3x04 that Littlefinger hasn't left KL yet, so it could be him, I suppose. It looks as if we'll know by the end of next week, from the looks of it.
Interior of the Sept was gorgeous (and the exterior wasn't too shabby, either). The Tyrion/Sansa wedding will be a nightmare, but at least the venue will be beautiful.

639	Winterfellian	2013-04-21	Her character is way more realistic than Brienne or Arya.  Where's the hate for them?Am curious In what way do you find her more "realistic"? She's a prostitute that can read and write (that should start cluing you in about the realism aspect. How many smallfolk in a medieval setting actually had this skill?) and now she's ascended to hand of the pimp, to borrow another poster description of her job. How many powerful men go about the city with a prostitute as executive assistant in Westeros?
640	Anarchosaurus Rex	2013-04-21	Thought that was a given.ep 9 - Red Weddingep 10 - Purple wedding.Season closes with Tyrion being accused and restrained.How would this be possible? Oberyn Martell has not even been mentioned by name yet, and he and Tyrion have already befriended each other by the time of the Purple Wedding. How will Oberyn volunteer to be Tyrion's champion when he has not even arrived at King's Landing?

So she has skills - still, bookLF would have been more circumspect about it.HOWEVER - look where he comes from. Hard not to see a reflection between her rise in station and his own.
642	Blaer Dayle	2013-04-21	Her character is way more realistic than Brienne or Arya.  Where's the hate for them?And who cares if she wasn't in the books?  There were a lot of whores in the books that aren't in the show, like Chataya, Alayaya, etc.  She serves a purpose.Arya and Brienne are quite realistic. Have you never known any Tomboys in your life?Exactly they cycle through whores in the books, because no one whore is able to gain any prominence in Westeros due to the profession being looked down upon. Anyone who uses whores does not respect them, or casts them aside when they are no longer wanted. It shows the lack of empathy the characters have for women who have lived hard lives, rather than showing how anyone can make a name for themselves in Westeros as long as they're willing to get naked.
643	Team Renlys Peach	2013-04-21	Those Theon scenes were great. Poor guy.Oh absolutely! Crazy Ramsay eyes! The firelight on his face made him all the more sinister at the end of that scene. Theon should be terrified!
644	Frumpus	2013-04-22	Yeah and I don't get why not. Their celibacy and inability to inherit drives quite a few important plot lines, especially with respect to the Lannisters and Casterly Rock.

Not to mention the whole "for life" thing - which is why Selmy's dismissal is supposed to be so shocking and the whole Robert the Strong storyline.It was important for Jaime but do you really think non-book readers would draw the same conclusion as book readers when it comes to Selmy? And we don't even know if they will use the Robert the Strong thing.

And we don't even know if they will use the Robert the Strong thing.They took the time to put Qyburn in the wreckage of Harrenhal so I assume they will introduce Frankenstein. Meh the Selmy part is too late, but still, Cersei has to arrange deaths in order to get who she wants on the KG so she can have her champion. I think that's important, but I guess they can get around it too.
646	Joyful Union	2013-04-22	Theon's speech about Ned being his real father...I cried a little
647	analeigh	2013-04-22	At least Ros is being used as a character instead of just stripping down for the obligatory sex scene for the episode. I don't mind her double agent role because I'm expecting Littlefinger to kill her when Sansa escapes King's Landing. She takes the place of Dontos and eliminates introducing more depth into a temporary character.
Also, I absolutely loved the scene of Sansa praying in nature! I like the little details that show the Starks haven't completely forgotten each other, the ways of the North, or Ned himself. Jon and Arya sharpening their blades like Ned did in Season 2, Sansa with the doll Ned gave her or praying in nature, Bran remembering his father and brothers teaching him to shoot a bow and arrow. Just warms my heart considering how much further the family will fall still.
And the Theon scenes...heartbreaking. Especially that line about his real father losing his head in King's Landing. Great added line by the tv writers.
648	Winterfellian	2013-04-22	I am bothered more by the fact that LF keeps her out in the open like that. So she has skills - still, bookLF would have been more circumspect about it.HOWEVER - look where he comes from. Hard not to see a reflection between her rise in station and his own.Exactly! He tours the city with her as one modern day business men or famous person would with his personal assistant!About the second, I subscribe to the idea that LF''s origins aren't as humble as he likes to pretend. Sure he's no lord paramount but is not as if he rose from a gutter like Varys or even Davos. He is the son of a lord (small lordship as it might be is still a lordship) and he was fostered in Riverrun. This means that growing up he received the same advantage of education and training that Lord Hoster's own children. This is far from being a self made man in the same scale as Varys or Davos are.
649	Lord of Cheese	2013-04-22	I liked much of it. And it finished very very well.
Im disappointed that its looking likely that we will not see Sam the Slayer. I was annoyed at how long the scene between Joff and Marg was taking for no character development or story advancement at all. I also am a little frustrated with the Bran scenes. Its pointless. I know Bran will have interweirwoodnet, but this is not the same as that. These seem more like dreams rather than reliving the past as an tree pov.
650	Ser_Patreck	2013-04-22	Am curious In what way do you find her more "realistic"? She's a prostitute that can read and write (that should start cluing you in about the realism aspect. How many smallfolk in a medieval setting actually had this skill?) and now she's ascended to hand of the pimp, to borrow another poster description of her job. How many powerful men go about the city with a prostitute as executive assistant in Westeros? The thing with "realistic" is - If a Song of Ice and Fire was as realistic as some people claim it is/has to be, Arya would have been dead in one week, Brienne would've been raped thrice already, and so would Sansa. When you do realize the thickness of plot armr around certain characters, and just the sheer amount of "coincidences" that brings characters together (Like the Hound and Arya, Jorah and Tyrion, Catelyn and Tyrion, so on and so forth), claims of "realism" seem to get a bit... Ridiculous.
651	Blue Steel	2013-04-22	Arya and Brienne are quite realistic. Have you never known any Tomboys in your life?Exactly they cycle through whores in the books, because no one whore is able to gain any prominence in Westeros due to the profession being looked down upon.

It shows the lack of empathy the characters have for women who have lived hard lives, rather than showing how anyone can make a name for themselves in Westeros as long as they're willing to get naked.Brienne is akin to having a real life woman be able to beat up Anderson Silva in a fight.  Not gonna happen.  The best woman MMA fighter, Ronda Rousey, wouldn't be able to beat a single male professional MMA fighter.  And what's so unrealistic about prostitutes being able to read and write?  There are bound to be high class whores, just like there are in real life.  There were many in history.Arya is a tomboy; and, tomboys are real.  But that doesn't make her character realistic.  There are definitely arguments to be made against Ros.  But realism isn't one of them.I don't think the level of realism when measured against the real world is an important criterion in the books; and thus, it shouldn't be an important criterion in the tv show either.  As long as they are realistic when it pertains to the world that GRRM created, then it's fine.  And in a world with characters like Lyanna, the Wolf Maidens of Winterfell and the Sand Snakes, Arya is fine.  But so is Ros.  She can exist because there are other smart women in her world.

652	teemo	2013-04-22	Of course a lot of people would be dead in Arya's situation, but not everyone with a storyline can die, or else there would be no characters.  Ros is just out of this world unbelievable and no depth or intrigue to her.  She's AN EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT TO A PIMP in Westeros.  That's just embarrassing.
653	Lady Lea	2013-04-22	Ros is not a high class whore, just a common one from the North.
654	Ser_Patreck	2013-04-22	Of course a lot of people would be dead in Arya's situation, but not everyone with a storyline can die, or else there would be no characters.Correct. "Realism" decides nothing. "Plot convenience" does.Ros is just out of this world unbelievable and no depth or intrigue to her.  She's AN EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT TO A PIMP in Westeros.

655	Blue Steel	2013-04-22	Ros is not a high class whore, just a common one from the North.And she's been with Littlefinger for over a year.  Not enough time to learn how to read?
656	Honey Badger	2013-04-22	I loved it.  How they handled Dany's scene was much better than the books.  In writing it felt too much like thievery how she took the Unsullied and got her dragon back.  Here on screen there's so much open contempt that I totally buy the idea that she says "fuck it" and attacks.  Still doesn't explain the fact that no slave city would allow trained warriors that could rebel against them.
I wish they showed the trial by combat but there's always next episode.  Theon saying he made the wrong choice with Winterfell was a bit weird since we don't know if book Theon missed Ned as his "real" father.  But whatever.
Edit: Ros I'm a little iffy about.  One the plus side Esme Bianco is hot as fuck.  If you Google her they turn off auto complete as the engine treats her as NSFW.  Hah!  On the negative end, it doesn't make sense for a podunk girl from a village to know how to read and write and understand political intrigue.  Hopefully LF makes short work of her with a crossbow Dontos style.

So it IS pretty clear that the Hound was indeed a member of Joffrey's KGYou're right. I just checked, and I had forgotten that little detail. Was that the only time that it was mentioned? If that's so then I think the show didn't explain pretty well that he was a member of the KG, but well at least they did explain it.
661	Vague04	2013-04-22	The Boston's are supposed to know that bran and rickon are not dead because in the books the bastard was pretending to be Theon's ally while still in Winterfell and it was actually his idea to kill the farmers sons and pretend they were the Starks. That was part of how he gained Theon's trust. Remember in the books it was Bolton men who killed Theon's men and burned Winterfell.

Book Theon definitely remorses over his decision to betray the Starks.  He even says to himself that he wishes he died fighting with Robb at the Red Wedding.  And there definitely more in the crypt scene as well.
663	Blue Steel	2013-04-22	What, is he in Teach for America now?So what's more realistic: Ros being able to read  or Brienne being one of the best warriors in the world?

664	Vague04	2013-04-22	The Hound was very clearly placed in the kings guard in the first season when Ser Barristan was dismissed, also he was shown in the white cloak multiple times including when he used it to cover up Sansa, which other people have also mentioned.
665	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	And she's been with Littlefinger for over a year.  Not enough time to learn how to read?Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't she supposed to learn how to fuck and please the clients? not read. And if LF would threaten her just for crying and making him lose money and time, then I don't think that he would want her to lose time learning to read.
666	Winterfellian	2013-04-22	The thing with "realistic" is - If a Song of Ice and Fire was as realistic as some people claim it is/has to be, Arya would have been dead in one week, Brienne would've been raped thrice already, and so would Sansa. When you do realize the thickness of plot armr around certain characters, and just the sheer amount of "coincidences" that brings characters together (Like the Hound and Arya, Jorah and Tyrion, Catelyn and Tyrion, so on and so forth), claims of "realism" seem to get a bit... Ridiculous.But the big difference, and is a big difference, is that all those characters you mentioned, unlike Ros, are key characters, important for the story. They are not simply a part of it, they are the ones that pull the plot forward. In other words, they mattered. There's a reason why they are protected by plot armour, at least until the author decides different.And anyway, my criticism of Ros is based mostly in terms of characterization. Unlike plot armoured characters like Sansa, Arya and Brienned Ros is too "modern" (and not in a good way) for this word:- She is a common prostitute that can actually read and write. /shocked.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':shocked:' /> In a world that doesn't exactly have public school districts and where most people are taught by maesters where on earth did she learn do do this? I doubt that LF keeps an education program for his "girls". If anything a man like LF benefits for having illiterate women at his service.- She rose high based on her skils which are....???? No in depth characterization there. Let's assume she does have them. But what could they possibly be  that would warrant her being paraded around the city- the capital city of Westeros- by Westeros' own maester of coin and future Lord Paramount of the Vale? /shocked.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':shocked:' />  . Based on her obscure origins I would say that those skills, if they existed, they would be of a nature that works best in the shadows- in a similar way in which Varys' little birds operates.ETA- The characters being compared to Ros are realistic for their setting. Ros is not.

667	Ampris	2013-04-22	Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't she supposed to learn how to fuck and please the clients? not read. And if LF would threaten her just for crying and making him lose money and time, then I don't think that he would want her to lose time learning to read.Umm... except that for someone who is a master of manipulation, spying, etc reading is a pretty integral skill.
668	Lady Lea	2013-04-22	So what's more realistic: Ros being able to read  or Brienne being one of the best warriors in the world?The whole point of Brienne is that GRRM wanted to deconstruct the trope of the women warrior and show a more realistic woman warrior than some waif that fights in a bikini. She's tall, she's brawny, and yeah, I buy that. We don't know if she's one of the best warriors in the world because the book never says that. She's good in melees but has never been to a real war iirc.Ros' entire point was getting a naked chick in the show. Her social rise is ridiculous and her being able to read is just laughable.
669	Blaer Dayle	2013-04-22	Brienne is akin to having a real life woman be able to beat up Anderson Silva in a fight.  Not gonna happen.  The best woman MMA fighter, Ronda Rousey, wouldn't be able to beat a single male professional MMA fighter.  And what's so unrealistic about prostitutes being able to read and write?  There are bound to be high class whores, just like there are in real life.  There were many in history.Arya is a tomboy; and, tomboys are real.  But that doesn't make her character realistic.  There are definitely arguments to be made against Ros.  But realism isn't one of them.I don't think the level of realism when measured against the real world is an important criterion in the books; and thus, it shouldn't be an important criterion in the tv show either.  As long as they are realistic when it pertains to the world that GRRM created, then it's fine.  And in a world with characters like Lyanna, the Wolf Maidens of Winterfell and the Sand Snakes, Arya is fine.  But so is Ros.  She can exist because there are other smart women in her world.Brienne is not someone who fights in a specialised fistfight with men, she has been trained in swordplay and is decent at it. There are plenty of women fencers in the world who can hold their own against men in their sport.Ros is established as a low class whore in the first episode and in the span of roughly a year has become one of the most pivotal people in the political landscape of Westeros, this is not a realistic character evolution. Characters like Varys and Littlefinger have devoted their lives to this and are only a step ahead of her now. If she possessed this intelligence before now she would have been working her way up in King's Landing long before the show began.There are smart whores in Westeros, but they mostly exist in the books and have been cut in the show to favour Ros, who as I've already shown should not be as important as she is in the show.And just out of curiosity, what about Arya do you find unrealistic? I'm not criticising that, and if you can give me a reason why you find her unrealistic it would help your argument a little. I find her to be realistic, but I'm not a 12 year old girl so I'm not really entitled to make that call.
670	Honey Badger	2013-04-22	Also wanted to add loved the sadistic angle of Varys torturing the sorceror, as well as Marg's scenes.  She absolutely plays stupid ass Sansa and stupid ass Joffrey.  Cersei sees it, but Tywin hates her incompetence and pride so much that he doesn't take the warning seriously.  Loved all of it.
671	HouseHarrison	2013-04-22	Loved the episode, maybe I'm not just as nitpicky.
I loved the quote by Varys on Littlefinger being the most dangerous man in Westeros. Seeing the master of whispers clearly uneasy about this little pauper noble from the fingers. It's even better if you know what exactly he's going to do later on.
Lastly, Daenerys' crowning moment of awesome was handled well.
672	~ZombieWife~	2013-04-22	Enjoying this season, but the format is kind of losing me.  Last season, it seemed we took "breaks" from various areas of the land and episodes might focus on 2-3 areas.  Now, we're cramming every single area in during every single episode (for the most part).  I'd much rather spend a solid 15-20 minutes of total time with Mance (for example), then only get 5 minutes because that "section of the world" is competing with 7 other storylines/characters.
I feel like I can't really get submersed with the exception of Jaime and Brienne.  For some reason, those pieces are working.
673	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	The whole point of Brienne is that GRRM wanted to deconstruct the trope of the women warrior and show a more realistic woman warrior than some waif that fights in a bikini. She's tall, she's brawny, and yeah, I buy that. We don't know if she's one of the best warriors in the world because the book never says that. She's good in melees but has never been to a real war iirc.Ros' entire point was getting a naked chick in the show. Her social rise is ridiculous and her being able to read is just laughable.Agree with you. Besides, Brienne has trained almost all her life with Ser Goodwin, the master-at-arms of her castle.
674	Oakenfist	2013-04-22	Ros will be offed by LF, a la Dontos. Book it.
675	HouseHarrison	2013-04-22	Are people really complaining about Ros being able to read/write? Geez. It's fantasy. Grounded in a degree of realism yet, but the top hooker of the mastermind of Westeros being able to read isn't that big a breach in realism. She's likely going to get Dontos'd (even though Dontos has appeared in the series), which would be a good end for her. Though we won't see that until next year.Enjoying this season, but the format is kind of losing me.  Last season, it seemed we took "breaks" from various areas of the land and episodes might focus on 2-3 areas.  Now, we're cramming every single area in during every single episode (for the most part).

For some reason, those pieces are working.Now this I agree with. I think the episode should focus on 3 storylines tops per episode.I think it has to do with billing/contracts more then anything, as the series regulars need to appear in a certain amount of episodes.

That Ros (over)heard Littlefinger reading the list and is just pretending to know how to read? That Littlefinger is putting her up to it? I mean, yeah, I know some of these are far-fetched (Except the last one) but I'm more willing to try to enjoy the episode than to rage on about two minutes of banter. And to avoid taking things at face value.2 - Everyone knows that Littlefinger is a pimp. The court, at least. The common people, seeing a lady in the Master of Coin's arm? Even those that have met Ros wouldn't recognize her. So parading her around is not that much of a problem. And Ros could have skills in reading people.My point is: This whole thing seems just people looking for excuses to complain about a character they don't like simply for not being in the book and for being used for titillation every now and then, and not actual grievances. Sorry for the honesty. I bow out of this discussion.

678	KnightsOfDany	2013-04-22	So wow that was just amazing, the show keeps uping the awesome. Just a few things i want to point out.
- The Sept just looked amazing
- Love the Marg playing Joff like a fiddle and her scenes with Sansa, oh man Natalie Dormer is just knocking it out of the Park
- Jamie and Breinne are as good as always (love they kept the hand around the neck)
- "Boy" fake out was cool but i loved that sick twisted smile he put on, shows whats to come
- The mutiny was played well no complaints hear, although i wish the Old Bear killed the prick Rast before he died.
- Brotherhood interaction with Sandor was good stuff all around
- Tywin and his damn letters........and the chat with Cersi was good stuff
- Dany oh Dany it was all amazing, the visuals, the score, just wow
Some questionable moments:
- Having Bran in the episode for a second felt out of place and random
- Loras and Sansa? is he not Kingsgaurd? not that i care all that much no need to name another Tyrell brother no one knows and have it all dashed in an episode or two anyway.
679	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-22	I like how the didn't reveal Dany knew valaryn until right when she took over the unsullied, much more of a oh shit moment i would geuss for the non book readers.
680	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	The Hound was very clearly placed in the kings guard in the first season when Ser Barristan was dismissed, also he was shown in the white cloak multiple times including when he used it to cover up Sansa, which other people have also mentioned.They never said that The Hound would take his place, check the scene again if you don't believe me. He was shown wearing a white cloak, but not the armor of the KG. The only moment that I remember, and thanks to the people that pointed that out to me, when it's said that Sandor is a member of the KG is during the Battle of Blackwater.ETA: So it was explained, but not very clear IMO.

681	Lady Lea	2013-04-22	1 - Did anyone entertained the thought Ros could've been a septa, or a lady in waiting or something that just became a whore through a series of unfortunate circumstances?She was in/around Winterfell when Sansa was born. Let's put Ros' age at about 25 (being generous here). She would be living around Winterfell since she was at least 12 then. I don't think there are many 12-year-old septas or ladies in waiting. She's just a peasant who became a whore.
682	Blue Steel	2013-04-22	Agree with you. Besides, Brienne has trained almost all her life with Ser Goodwin, the master-at-arms of her castle.Training all her life with Ser Goodwin is just a plot contrivance in order to deflect from the illogical.  She still would likely get crushed by an average swordsman if it was real life.And just out of curiosity, what about Arya do you find unrealistic? I'm not criticising that, and if you can give me a reason why you find her unrealistic it would help your argument a little. I find her to be realistic, but I'm not a 12 year old girl so I'm not really entitled to make that call.Actually, Arya is my second favorite character; and  I'm even less of an authority on whether Arya's internal monologue is realistic since I'm not even a girl.  Arya is unrealistic because there is no way that Arya would have survived for that long on her own during a bloody war.  It's  a plot contrivance that's written well.Anyways, I don't think realism is important.   Realism exists at the expense of plot.

I just don't see any motive to rage on about it instead of just shrugging it off.Because when the show is only on average 53 minutes long, and 3-4 minutes are used every episode on a character who shouldn't exist it adds up, and wastes almost a whole episode's worth of time that could be used on anything else.1 - Did anyone entertained the thought Ros could've been a septa, or a lady in waiting or something that just became a whore through a series of unfortunate circumstances? That Ros (over)heard Littlefinger reading the list and is just pretending to know how to read? That Littlefinger is putting her up to it? I mean, yeah, I know some of these are far-fetched (Except the last one) but I'm more willing to try to enjoy the episode than to rage on about two minutes of banter. And to avoid taking things at face value.The show has been pretty explicit so far about when characters are deceiving one another or feigning ignorance (through body language/facial expressions), I doubt that the rules change when Ros is in the room (and if they do it only strengthens my argument that she is a bad creation) Otherwise you simply propose backstories that justify her character faults, which the viewers shouldn't have to do. the characters should speak for themselves without the fans inventing reasons why they are the way they are.Arya is my second favorite character actually.  I'm even less of an authority on whether Arya's internal monologue is realistic since I'm not even a girl.  Arya is unrealistic because there is no way that Arya would have survived for that long on her own during a bloody war.  It's  a plot contrivance that's written well.Anyways, I don't think realism is important.   Realism exists at the expense of plot.Fair enough, but that's not the character that's at fault it's the plot itself that works around killing Arya off. She was smart enough to avoid revealing her identity to the wrong people. She has had some luck, I'll give you that, but even when her identity was revealed, remember that during medieval wars members of high-ranking nobility become a currency of sorts (trading for other prisoners/surrenders/etc), so it would serve no character who knows who she is any purpose to kill her. I'm also not a girl, so I'm afraid I really have no idea whether she thinks like one.

Ned actually had to have one built for his own wife when Cat first came to WF, which proves that there probably isn't one in the winter town. If Ros, who by her own admittance, grew up in Winterfell's shadow, how can she possibly have been a Septa?ETA-Ros is a secret Targaryen. /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' /> Nahhh...she's Jon's mother

Couldn't have found better casting. Theon's scene I think they fucked up how he was walking and talking fine.  He should have been hobbling badly with Bolton helping him.  I couldn't help but notice Theon didn't care his finger/fingernail was missing, he got flayed a bit, and he took a wooden spike through the foot.  His transformation should already be halfway through.

690	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-04-22	Ros is a secret Targaryen.Why not /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />I don't like Ros either, I think there is much that could be done instead of wasting time on her... but... I've read the books, that's why I feel she could be gone. And many people hasn't and they dont' mind about her nor are aware she doesn't exist. That and we need characters like her to explain certain stuff or changes because sometimes, some plots are neither obvious or clear for non readers.  And why not, readers as well. If they are changing Sansa's escape, I'm intrigued about it. It's good sometimes they do change stuff for us who did read, so we don't know everything.
691	Vhailorian	2013-04-22	Gods!!!! With all the great things this episode had, all anyone can talk about for 2 plus pages is Ros hatred? I normally don't get my hackles up about people's opinions, which of course they have every right to voice, but Seven bloody Hells have I grown weary of hearing the same old Ros complaints on these boards for 2+ seasons.
	 Every time the writers give her a line people find something in it to complain about: "The writers make her seem smarter than Varys..." "Ros is naked too much..." Ros is only good for being naked and she isn't naked enough..." "The actress is terrible..." "Ros isn't even a book character..." Maybe I will compile a list of the 1000 most common complaints about Ros and number them so the persistent complaints can read more like...Ros #768...Handy shorthand so I can get to fresh and interesting opinions rather than stale ones dating back to the pilot episode.
	 This is coming from someone who is much closer to being a book purist than a show changing apologist. I didn't like Ros either...but I learned to live with it rather than beating everyone who will listen or read over the head with the same complaints over and over. I learned to accept the role and have come to like Esme Bianco. Furthermore, she has played a valuable and, at times necessary, role in the show in a number of ways. The way D&D have chosen to adapt the show, right or wrong, made Ros, or a character like her, necessary.
	 Sorry for the angry rant...but I stand by everything in it, and I needed to vent it. I am far from a prolific poster, but I do spend a good deal of time on these boards and having to sort through the same rants for pages at a time for years is getting real old.

694	greensleeves	2013-04-22	On Ros and realism:
We've seen Ros rise from common prostitute to 'Bottom Girl'... and maybe even 'Madam' working under Littlefinger.  Neither of these positions is unusual or unrealistic.  Also, as a well known brothel owner, it's not unrealistic or even unusual for Littlefinger to be seen with Ros.
Her quick rise to the position is unusual, but that could be justified by her literacy.
The literacy... yes that's a bit out there, but maybe she just had a lot of time and access to Winterfell's library?  Okay... it's a stretch.

697	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-22	Awesome episode! A few favorite moments:- Ramsay's hyena smile. There was foreshadowing when he seemed to eyeroll when he was fiddling with the gate.- Sansa looking like she was about to burst into tears; Margaery being so sweet and funny. She's like walking Prozac if she wants to make you happy.- Joffrey acting like a lovesick puppy. His look of devotion when she spoke about severity, then his slightly worried expression when they first walked out to greet the people. If he didn't like her so much he would've been pissed they were saying Margaery, but it seemed to me he was more "holy crap, she's right!" Not that he's softening up as a person; he'd clearly view "giving the people love" as just a form of manipulation for the stupid peasants.- Varys flirting with Olenna. Goodness they were cute. Varys' little glance at his nethers when she talked about the nonexistent meeting the decrepit. /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />- Jaime's opening scene made me sad. I get very /unsure.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':unsure:' /> when proud characters get broken down. I don't think Brienne was being sexist; I think she was just trying to say something that would piss him off.- Arya's red eyes. Not tears of grief, but rather eyes getting watery with a super strong emotion. - The whole final scene, of course.

698	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	Umm... except that for someone who is a master of manipulation, spying, etc reading is a pretty integral skill.And that's exactly why he wouldn't want his common whores (who as we have seen he doesn't give a shit about) to learn to read and be able to read his notes, plots or schemes (oops plots and schemes are the same thing) and then go babbling around telling them. Besides, and I could be wrong, but I think that LF wouldn't be so stupid as to trust his plans with whores. But then show LF is just a pimp (like other people have said) compared with book LF.

Then he went to pick it up with his stump and was like, "Fuck, I don't have a hand."

700	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	Ros is a secret Targaryen.Yes, why not? Shae also is one because in season 1 she didn't get burn by fire.
701	ChozenOne	2013-04-22	I'm not a Ros fan, but i do't get all the hate. She is obviously supposed to replace Alayaya to a degree, with Cersei thinking she was Tyrion's whore, and in the book he had the absurd thought that she was learning to read. That should put to rest all this "whores can't read!" nosense.
And i thought the Pod/whores scene was funny. The continuation was a bit weird, but the Varys getting cut story, combined with the dumbing down of sorcery being associated with red god (Melisandre and Jaqen) is leading me to believe that pod might get his magic dick burnt in a brazier like Varys, courtesy of Lady Stoneheart and the brotherhood, who also worship the red god. Don't know why, just a hunch.
I loved everything Dany this episode, and i'm not a big fan of hers. Dracarys was perfect! Ramsay's creepy look was great, and did he totally change his voice at the end of that scene or is it just me?
Craster's was great too! I think Rast's line about killing Sam soon is forshadowing him as a wight. Instead of small Paul it will be Rast about to kill Sam and Gilly when Coldhand's  murder of crows comes to the rescue! I wouldn't worry about Sam the slayer not happening. Fat guy and girl with baby will be slow, Grenn will catch up, see it, and they'll get split up again.  Great episode!
702	Faceless Sam	2013-04-22	Theon's scene I think they fucked up how he was walking and talking fine.  He should have been hobbling badly with Bolton helping him.  I couldn't help but notice Theon didn't care his finger/fingernail was missing, he got flayed a bit, and he took a wooden spike through the foot.  His transformation should already be halfway through.well, they got two seasons for torturing theon every once in a while before we get to the actual reek chapters of ADWD.
703	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-04-22	On Ros and realism:We've seen Ros rise from common prostitute to 'Bottom Girl'... and maybe even 'Madam' working under Littlefinger.  Neither of these positions is unusual or unrealistic.  Also, as a well known brothel owner, it's not unrealistic or even unusual for Littlefinger to be seen with Ros.Her quick rise to the position is unusual, but that could be justified by her literacy.The literacy... yes that's a bit out there, but maybe she just had a lot of time and access to Winterfell's library?  Okay... it's a stretch.Her knowledge of Winterfell could also be a factor for Baelysh keeping her close. Maybe it's not Arya but "Sansa" who they send to Winterfell to marry.And maybe she knows how to read because her father thought her? I'm sure she wasn't born a whore.
704	Vhailorian	2013-04-22	Sorry if this has been mentioned (I am a few pages behind)..but did anyone notice that both last week and this week  "Boy" used my lord and not m'lord referring to Theon? Last week they even contrasted it with Locke using m'lord when referring to Jamie in the next scene. First tangible reason for some of the exceedingly well written and well acted, but seemingly unnecessary, scenes between Tywin and Arya at Harrenhal.
705	Blaer Dayle	2013-04-22	Gods!!!! With all the great things this episode had, all anyone can talk about for 2 plus pages is Ros hatred? I normally don't get my hackles up about people's opinions, which of course they have every right to voice, but Seven bloody Hells have I grown weary of hearing the same old Ros complaints on these boards for 2+ seasons.	 Every time the writers give her a line people find something in it to complain about: "The writers make her seem smarter than Varys..." "Ros is naked too much..." Ros is only good for being naked and she isn't naked enough..." "The actress is terrible..." "Ros isn't even a book character..." Maybe I will compile a list of the 1000 most common complaints about Ros and number them so the persistent complaints can read more like...Ros #768...Handy shorthand so I can get to fresh and interesting opinions rather than stale ones dating back to the pilot episode.	 This is coming from someone who is much closer to being a book purist than a show changing apologist. I didn't like Ros either...but I learned to live with it rather than beating everyone who will listen or read over the head with the same complaints over and over. I learned to accept the role and have come to like Esme Bianco. Furthermore, she has played a valuable and, at times necessary, role in the show in a number of ways. The way D&D have chosen to adapt the show, right or wrong, made Ros, or a character like her, necessary.	 Sorry for the angry rant...but I stand by everything in it, and I needed to vent it. I am far from a prolific poster, but I do spend a good deal of time on these boards and having to sort through the same rants for pages at a time for years is getting real old.I'm sorry about that, but I tried to make a thread about Ros specifically so that people wouldn't have to read it if they didn't want, but the moderators never approved it, you can blame them that this is the only appropriate thread in which we can actually discuss Ros.The literacy... yes that's a bit out there, but maybe she just had a lot of time and access to Winterfell's library?  Okay... it's a stretch.But again that is us having to invent a reason for why the character can exist rather than her existing naturally, which is what makes it unrealistic.
706	Ser_Patreck	2013-04-22	- Jaime's opening scene made me sad. I get very /unsure.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':unsure:' /> when proud characters get broken down.I found it quite appropriate, actually. You have to be broken and shattered before you can be rebuilt.
707	pleonasm	2013-04-22	This was the strongest episode of the season and if we don't count Blackwater, possibly the best of the last two seasons.
That said, I do have some minor quibbles.
I still have some issues with how Benioff and Weiss focus their attention. The focus of this episode should have been "Astapor". It needed more than a single scene, even as good as that the scene was. Jamie/Brienne, Cersei, and Margaery all had multiple scenes this week. They needed to fully sell us on the idea that Danny might give up one of her Dragons. Even non-book reader friends of mine weren't convinced for a moment that she was actually going to give up a Dragon for an Army. A small scene with Barristan where she shows some doubt or highlights the risk of what she is doing, would have done that storyline wonders and/or a scene 'showing' and not telling us about the conditions of the Slave class in Astapor would have helpful as well (this would highlight one of Danny's underlying motivations for her actions).
The mutiny in the Night's Watch could also have used some better setup. They at least hinted at some discontent in a previous episode, but it felt bungled and confusing this week. The Watch also had critically wounded? It was hard to tell anyone had anything but superficial wounds from the exteriors shot in Iceland.
Both these storylines needed more time and scenes to truly flourish and deliver their respective payoffs. I would have given up the walkabout in the Sept or even Tyrion and Vary's scenes for a tighter focus and make this a great episode rather than a good one.

708	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-22	jaime being completely humbled was my favorite scene besides the ending.
709	Words of Winter	2013-04-22	I can't believe they carried on with that Podrick joke. For fuck's sake."You sound like a bloody woman!" well, Brienne was never this sexist in the books tbh.Overall though, best episode of the series so far. Excelent Dany and Marg scenes. I LOVED how giddy Joffrey was.  Not outright, but there is a scene, ( I just reread it last night) where she mentions that 'she is her fathers only s--' and then Jamie berates that she was going to say son.  She hates that she is not a son, just like Cersei.  She wants honor, Cersei wants powe, but the society only gives them the option of marriage.
710	Vhailorian	2013-04-22	Thank the Gods, I thought I was dealing with an insane person here. Nice avatar by the way, I love Chrono TriggerFor me it's because she's a Mary Sue of sorts, the whore who comes from nothing, accomplishes everything she could ever want, do things she could never possible do in a realistic world (like reading), thus reducing the beleivability of the realistic world George created, reduces the image of other characters, like Littlefinger and Varys by always having some clever insight into their character (knowing that LF can't be trusted) or knowing something they don't (seeing that LF booked 2 beds when Varys didn't), and all this from a character who shouldn't be taking up screen time that could be used to get more plot from the books that is cut to save time, simply because D&D want to place their stamp on the universe regardless of what fans think. That is why I hate Ros so much.See the above. And to be fair I like Talisa. I would have liked to see Jeyne Westerling, but Talisa is fine as well since she is at least based on something from the books, has a reason to be around Robb and fall in love with him being a nurse on the battlefields  and actually serves a useful part in the plot without diminishing other characters.	 I don't know why I am even posting this, but everything you said about Ros applies to Talisa. How does a plucky spitfire of a Florence Nightengail type wandering around, alone and unguarded, through the battlefields of Westeros not force me to question the gritty reality of the world depicted on screen? A spunky foreign noblewoman to boot? And one that sasses Roose Bolton in front of a large group of people and lives to marry the King in the North??? Fits right in...and of course Ros the whore stretches the bounds of credulity. Everyone knows there are no whores in Westeros.
711	JonDunn	2013-04-22	More and more I think we'll see UnCat this season. Bran's dream of Cat turning paler and paler and more aggressive and evil in his dream feels like a foreshadowing.
712	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	I'm sorry about that, but I tried to make a thread about Ros specifically so that people wouldn't have to read it if they didn't want, but the moderators never approved it, you can blame them that this is the only appropriate thread in which we can actually discuss Ros.They didn't? oh too bad..
713	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-04-22	I can't believe they carried on with that Podrick joke. For fuck's sake."You sound like a bloody woman!" well, Brienne was never this sexist in the books tbh.I don't see it as "sexist" but Brienne finally open up a bit to Jaime.

I would have given up the walkabout in the Sept or even Tyrion and Vary's scenes for a tighter focus and make this a great episode rather than a good one.I understand your complaints.  I wish they could have done a little more with each, but overall I was happy with what they did.  I think if they drew out the Astaphor scene, it would have garnered complaints, like "common, get to it already" etc.  They had to balance the TV audience's attention threshold with the scenes and the time HBO gave them.  It's a lot harder than I think we give them credit for.  Nevertheless, it was a strong episode.
715	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	And maybe she knows how to read because her father thought her? I'm sure she wasn't born a whore.She was definitely not born a whore, and it could be, but normal peasants usually don't know how to read.ETA: Many people got confused with my post. So...When I say common peasant I am refering to Ros' father. I think Ros is not a very common peasant because she is very ambitious. Otherwise, She wouldn't even have moved to KL.

Fits right in...and of course Ros the whore stretches the bounds of credulity. Everyone knows there are no whores in Westeros.Talisa as has been revealed through dialogue was born a noble in Essos (again this was revealed unlike Ros past which is left vague) which explains her sense of entitlement. She is able to walk around unguarded because she is offering medical attention to any injured soldier regardless of affiliation. Who in their right mind would stop her from doing that? Roose may very well have killed Talisa had Robb not stopped him. Robb is blinded to her problems because of young love. Everyone else tells him it's a bad idea, and tries to keep him from going ahead with it. I never said any criticisms about whores in Westeros, in fact I defend the inclusion of whores in another post if you want to pull up posts from a few pages ago, I have a problem with a whore who comes to shape Westerosi politics in such a short time from rising from the brothels of Winterfell.They didn't? oh too bad..And I don't appreciate the sarcasm, I've got just as much right as anyone on this board to post threads and discuss my opinions.

717	MoA«t	2013-04-22	Of course Ros can read. She's helping LF run his business. And just as a matter of history, Courtezans/Geisha not only read, were well educated, and played music, they were very well versed in politics.
Whores know more than you think they do, they have to be able to count their money.
718	Prince of Dragonstone	2013-04-22	What really gets me about the Cersei/Tywin scene was the crowd pleasing line of "You are not as smart as you think you are." We as book readers know that Cersei eventually delves into paranoid madness and makes rash, idiotic decisions because of this. But in THIS moment with Tywin she is absolutely correct that House Tyrell is plotting and angling for the throne in their own subtle way. Cersei is right to be wary of Margaery and Olenna because they end up being instrumental in assassinating her son. Joffrey's death then drives Cersei over the edge and she becomes a truly wicked character, but in THIS moment she still has her head in the game and she sees the Tyrells for what they are. It's Tywin who cannot see the forest for the trees in this matter. The Tyrells might be as devious as the Lannisters but they are just as ambitious and scheming. Just in a different way.
719	greensleeves	2013-04-22	But again that is us having to invent a reason for why the character can exist rather than her existing naturally, which is what makes it unrealistic.I was just pointing out that a lot of the reasons people were calling Ros 'unrealistic' aren't unrealistic at all, and in fact pretty expected in the business of prostitution.  She was definitely not born a whore, and it could be, but normal peasants usually don't know how to read.We know that Ros left the North in search of more opportunity.  This tells me she was ambitious and had probably already reached the top of the heap at whatever brothel she had been working at.  It's entirely possible that she was involved in finances there and learned to read to further her career.  It's not like she's reading Tolstoy in this episode; she's just looking at an inventory.We all have thresholds of disbelief when consuming media.  I don't really need to know why Ros can read; I don't find it so unrealistic that I need an answer.  She is, after all, an ambitious business woman.Contrast this with Pod's sex powers... I found that to be so entirely unbelievable that I had to spend time thinking about 'the great whore mystery' (Thanks to Ran for spoiling me and stopping my brain there).  I doubt there has ever been a case where three whores voluntarily gave a man (a virgin even) a freebie cause he was just *so good*.  No way.  That bothered me.I also find Talisa to be more unrealistic than Ros, but not as much as Pod (not by a long shot).

720	TomBadgerlock	2013-04-22	Ros is awesome. And the fact that so many dislike her and her inclusions just makes me like her even more. She is a bit like the Common Man in A Man for All Seasons.
721	Juliads	2013-04-22	The best part was when Jaime was fighting in the mud and he dropped his sword.  Then he went to pick it up with his stump and was like, "Fuck, I don't have a hand."that scene hurt to watch.  Made me flinch.
722	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2013-04-22	One thing that raised a smile: Olenna commenting on the dullness of the Tyrell words and image, in comparison with the Stark's and Greyjoy's. Sounds a lot like many discussions on this forum.
723	Juliads	2013-04-22	all these opinions about Ros.... myself, i find her to be a rather empty character.  A good vessel to present a story or a theme, but not much for individual characteristics or personal conflict.  I don't mind her at all if her scenes are working towards a plot I enjoy, But using her to rehash that damn waste of space pod joke was irritating was all hell.  I enjoy her far more than Talisa, i have to admit.
724	TomBadgerlock	2013-04-22	One thing that raised a smile: Olenna commenting on the dullness of the Tyrell words and image, in comparison with the Stark's and Greyjoy's. Sounds a lot like many discussions on this forum.Perhaps that was this episode's fandom reference? Like Cersei's comment about Tyrion's nose, Gendry's comment about Arya's choice of names, and Tyrion's reference to the Meereenese Knot.
725	Vhailorian	2013-04-22	But the big difference, and is a big difference, is that all those characters you mentioned, unlike Ros, are key characters, important for the story. They are not simply a part of it, they are the ones that pull the plot forward. In other words, they mattered. There's a reason why they are protected by plot armour, at least until the author decides different.And anyway, my criticism of Ros is based mostly in terms of characterization. Unlike plot armoured characters like Sansa, Arya and Brienned Ros is too "modern" (and not in a good way) for this word:- She is a common prostitute that can actually read and write. /shocked.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':shocked:' /> In a world that doesn't exactly have public school districts and where most people are taught by maesters where on earth did she learn do do this? I doubt that LF keeps an education program for his "girls". If anything a man like LF benefits for having illiterate women at his service.- She rose high based on her skils which are....???? No in depth characterization there. Let's assume she does have them. But what could they possibly be  that would warrant her being paraded around the city- the capital city of Westeros- by Westeros' own maester of coin and future Lord Paramount of the Vale? /shocked.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':shocked:' />  . Based on her obscure origins I would say that those skills, if they existed, they would be of a nature that works best in the shadows- in a similar way in which Varys' little birds operates.ETA- The characters being compared to Ros are realistic for their setting. Ros is not.	 I could sit down for a half an hour and invent a story or two about how and why Ros is who she is and fit it seamlessly into the context of GRRM's Westeros. I could also nitpick any number of book characterizations and how they don't blend as seamlessly with the world as they could. It would serve all the Ros haters right if D&D went to great lengths to explain and flesh out the character they detest so much. Then the complaint would be, "How can the spend so much time on making a non-canon character a major character?" It's not like they are focusing on her as a character...she is just a plot device that is useful in a multitude of ways.	 To those who take issue with Ros the reading whore I would say, "Books and television normally focus on characters that are unusual or exceptional in some way...get used to it." One whore in thousands in Westeros can read without giving  an explanation and suddenly everyone is the Song of Ice and Fire reality police...sheesh
726	MoA«t	2013-04-22	The Hound was a member of the KG in the books, but not in the show. In season 1 Joffrey dismissed Barristan from the KG, but never said that Sandor would take his place. In season 2 Sandor gives his cloak to Sansa, but even though it was white, it was just his cloak, not a KG cloak because if you pay attention, through out the whole season 2 he never wears the KG armor.He's KG in both. During the Blackwater episode, Tyrion specifically says, "You're King's Guard, Clegane." That's when The Hound says, "Fuck the King's Guard, fuck the city, and FUCK THE KING."Edit: /ninja.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ninja:' /> I am so behind in this thread. /huh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':huh:' />

728	sertravisredbeard	2013-04-22	These discussions about "realistic" characters and their obviously implausible traits are cracking me up. It's a show and set of books about dragons, ice zombies, resurrected-by-fire immortals and magically face changing assassins.  But apparently the notion of whores reading and women fighting are completely unbelievable.  It's like GRRM and D&D don't take the fantasy genre seriously or something.
That sarcasm aside I enjoyed the episode.
I think the Dondarrion actor change works because this one looks older and more worn out, it's like each time he dies and comes back he actually ages.  The duel should be great.

729	Vhailorian	2013-04-22	Because when the show is only on average 53 minutes long, and 3-4 minutes are used every episode on a character who shouldn't exist it adds up, and wastes almost a whole episode's worth of time that could be used on anything else.	 Ros took no time away from anyone...Ros gave us more Varys time...This is nearly always the case with the characters she interacts with as Ros is never the focal point or the purpose of the scenes she takes part in.
730	Jon Icefyre	2013-04-22	Wow that episode was fuckin epic!  My three favorite quotes :Theon: "My real father lost his head at Kings Landing...I made a choice, and I chose wrong."-  God that almost made me cry lolTywin : "I don't mistrust you because you're a woman, I mistrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are."-  It's about time someone put Cersei in her fucking place while calling her out for her horrible parenting skills. She can bitch about the Tyrells all she wants, but she created that monster Joffrey that the Tyrells are now fucking with by spoiling the living fuck out of him, and letting him do whatever he wanted with no consequences so this is just karma kickin her in the ass. And I know I'm suppose to hate the guy but Tywin is by far my favorite character of season three so far lol oh well. /ohwell.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ohwell:' />Olenna Tyrell: "Another golden rose, how original?  I eat from plates stamped with roses, I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses, I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better, roses are boring dear.   Growing strong hah, the dullest words of any house.  Winter is coming!  Now that's memorable.  We do not soe.  Strong, strong those houses you watch out for, direwolfs and crackons fierce beasts, but a golden rose growing strong? Hah that strikes fear in the heart. /rolleyes.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' /> Look little flowers the spider in the garden, run along now, grow strong."-  Haha god I absolutely adore this woman!!  I could literally just sit in that garden and listen to her talk all day. /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />As for the rest of the episode RIP Commander Mormont.  Anyone else notice the Tyrells are planning to marry Sansa to Loras instead of Willas?  And btw my god Dany ended that episode like a fuckin badass!! /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />

This tells me she was ambitious and had probably already reached the top of the heap at whatever brothel she had been working at.  It's entirely possible that she was involved in finances there and learned to read to further her career.  You've made a valid point about Ros and her ambitions, I never thought about it from that angle. Still I don't believe that she could have gained that much influence, that quickly in King's Landing, which is my biggest gripe, and which nobody has adequately addressed enough to make me change my mind.	 Ros took no time away from anyone...Ros gave us more Varys time...This is nearly always the case with the characters she interacts with as Ros is never the focal point or the purpose of the scenes she takes part in.But she did take time, she was the focal point of the scene, that was my original problem, her scene diminished Varys by implying that she was better at his job than he is. Her scenes would be just more opportunities to see these characters if they weren't consistently written to remind me how great she is.All that said, I actually like the actress playing Ros, and think she does well with what she is given, I believe her portrayal of the character, but she is sloppily written, and unrealistic.I've said all I really care to say on Ros at this point, I'm obviously not going to change any minds, and you obviously aren't going to make me change mine. It seems that nobody wants to hear any more about it anyway, so I'll stop there.Other than the whole Ros thing this was one of my favourite episodes so far, and I don't want the whole thing to be marred by this conversation about a 2 minute sequence.On the comment just made about Tyrion, he is intelligent because he compensated for his physical problems by becoming intelligent, because he felt like he was the least important member of his house due to his dwarfism. I see nothing unrealistic there. In fact his character is the most realistic of the series to me at least. All that intelligence doesn't matter anyway since nobody takes him seriously due to his condition.These discussions about "realistic" characters and their obviously implausible traits. It's a show and set of books about dragons, ice zombies, resurrected-by-fire immortals and magically face changing assassins.  But apparently the notion of whores reading and women fighting are completely unbelievable.  It's like GRRM and D&D don't take the fantasy genre seriously or something.That sarcasm aside I enjoyed the episode.Magic in this world was long thought to be dead, and has only come back with the dragons. I'm perfectly fine with that.

732	Newstar	2013-04-22	There was one huge gaping plot hole in this episode which really bugged me.
Varys knows that Littlefinger is heading off to woo Lysa Arryn. He is doing so on Tywin's instructions, to bring her into the fold. However, Varys is assuming that Littlefinger is banking on marrying Sansa Stark. Littlefinger can hardly marry both of them, though. Does he think Littlefinger's just going to renege on his promise to bring Lysa Arryn into the fold and marry Sansa Stark instead?
733	Vhailorian	2013-04-22	What really gets me about the Cersei/Tywin scene was the crowd pleasing line of "You are not as smart as you think you are." We as book readers know that Cersei eventually delves into paranoid madness and makes rash, idiotic decisions because of this. But in THIS moment with Tywin she is absolutely correct that House Tyrell is plotting and angling for the throne in their own subtle way. Cersei is right to be wary of Margaery and Olenna because they end up being instrumental in assassinating her son. Joffrey's death then drives Cersei over the edge and she becomes a truly wicked character, but in THIS moment she still has her head in the game and she sees the Tyrells for what they are. It's Tywin who cannot see the forest for the trees in this matter. The Tyrells might be as devious as the Lannisters but they are just as ambitious and scheming. Just in a different way.Heh...all too true. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> I laughed at the because of the supreme irony rather than the comment itself. I like that a reader and non-reader could be equally amused by this line for very different reasons.
734	MoA«t	2013-04-22	Gods!!!! With all the great things this episode had, all anyone can talk about for 2 plus pages is Ros hatred? I normally don't get my hackles up about people's opinions, which of course they have every right to voice, but Seven bloody Hells have I grown weary of hearing the same old Ros complaints on these boards for 2+ seasons.	 Every time the writers give her a line people find something in it to complain about: "The writers make her seem smarter than Varys..." "Ros is naked too much..." Ros is only good for being naked and she isn't naked enough..." "The actress is terrible..." "Ros isn't even a book character..." Maybe I will compile a list of the 1000 most common complaints about Ros and number them so the persistent complaints can read more like...Ros #768...Handy shorthand so I can get to fresh and interesting opinions rather than stale ones dating back to the pilot episode.	 This is coming from someone who is much closer to being a book purist than a show changing apologist. I didn't like Ros either...but I learned to live with it rather than beating everyone who will listen or read over the head with the same complaints over and over. I learned to accept the role and have come to like Esme Bianco. Furthermore, she has played a valuable and, at times necessary, role in the show in a number of ways. The way D&D have chosen to adapt the show, right or wrong, made Ros, or a character like her, necessary.	 Sorry for the angry rant...but I stand by everything in it, and I needed to vent it. I am far from a prolific poster, but I do spend a good deal of time on these boards and having to sort through the same rants for pages at a time for years is getting real old.These discussions about "realistic" characters and their obviously implausible traits are cracking me up. It's a show and set of books about dragons, ice zombies, resurrected-by-fire immortals and magically face changing assassins.  But apparently the notion of whores reading and women fighting are completely unbelievable.  It's like GRRM and D&D don't take the fantasy genre seriously or something. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' /> /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />

I can't get over how brilliant that was. It's delivered with such enthusiasm and delight. It's so perversely awesome.
736	Vhailorian	2013-04-22	But she did take time, she was the focal point of the scene, that was my original problem, her scene diminished Varys by implying that she was better at his job than he is. Her scenes would be just more opportunities to see these characters if they weren't consistently written to remind me how great she is.	 This will be my last word on the matter as well, as my whole reason for jumping into this was to try and end it. (Poorly played me) /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> The point of the scene was not Ros or showing that she was better at Varys's job than Varys...the point of the scene was to inform Varys of Littlefinger's possible plan to spirit Sansa away from King's Landing.

One of my favourite episodes of the series thus far, and the best this season without question.
739	Cat in the Rafters	2013-04-22	Re: Pod's performance. Before his scene with the girls, Littlefinger mentions to Tyrion how A.) Tyrion owes Pod a favor for saving his life, and B.) Littlefinger owes Tyrion a favor (I think for saving the city?). Maybe Littlefinger decided that the easiest way to be rid of this troublesome debt is by letting Pod have his first night on the house? Sure, Tyrion could gnash his teeth about it, saying that he never agreed to it, but a favor's a favor, and now Littlefinger's slate is clean.
On topic: I am completley in love with Natalie Dormer's characterization of Margaery. After seeing this ep right on the heels of finding her deleted scene with Loras on Youtube... this Margaery is a million times more interesting to me than the Marg in the books.
Another favorite bit was Sansa praying at the weirwood stump. THE SYMBOLISM. (I can't remember if the heart tree is a stump in the books.) All my feels, Sansa dove.

C'mon now Joffrey is just enthusiastic about history. He's a scholar. He enjoys scholarly pursuits.TV Joff really is much more fun as a character and villain than Book Joff. I was cracking up at most  of that scene.
741	ghost of Harrenhall	2013-04-22	Cat's face at the end of the tree shot, looked like it was dead.  
 can't wait for stone heart.
742	Vhailorian	2013-04-22	This may very well have been my favorite episode in the series thus far, though I need another viewing or two to be sure. One thing I can say definitively is that I nitpicked this episode less than any in recent memory. I managed to suffer from none of my usual "But in the book..." thoughts and comparisons. The Brienne "you're acting like a woman" comment did hit my ear strangely...but on further reflection I believe she was simply playing to what she knew Jamie would react to. The only other moment of strangeness for me was that the Bran scene seemed out of place in this episode...not a bad scene, but it was drowned out by the rest of the episode in my opinion. Also, I cant remember who originally posted it, but Cat in the Bran scene did bring Lady Stoneheart to my mind as well.
	 The "Dracarys" scene was...just...well...I won't embarrass myself by describing my reaction while I am tired enough to be totally honest. I'll simply say that it was more amazing than I could have hoped. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
743	greywindsrage	2013-04-22	They should have cut from Jaime to Bran. It was very powerful when they did that a few back with Catelyn and Jon.Makes perfect sense. As much as I'm a fan of Jaime , I still believe that it was karma for what he did to Bran.
744	teemo	2013-04-22	Strangely enough, I really liked the Tywin/Cersei scene, and I'm usually not a big fan of the invented scenes.  It worked great after last week watching him emotionally beat down Tyrion...shows what an ass he is.  And also, the line about her not being as smart as she thinks she is is comforting to me (I thought they were going to turn Cersei into someone much smarter than she really is) and also some good foreshadowing.  Not to mention, ironic considering that she's actually correct in this case about the Tyrells.  And funny too, because she was the one insulting Tyrion's intelligence earlier in the season.  All of those letters that Tywin was writing had me interested, although he's always doing that.I think the episode actually fared better without The Tullys, Starks, and Stannis...the characters people complain the most about being butchered (Robb, Talisa, Cat, Stannis).  Shae wasn't in it either.
745	Joey Beers	2013-04-22	Ok. Just got home and watched the episode. So I've read some of the posts but not nearly all. Had to say though, great episode! I've been straddling the line between those who like the show for what it is and those who can't abide the changes from the books. I still wish we could have some sort of epic year long mini-series that portrayed ASOIAF exactly how it is, but we don't. The television version that we do have right now has done a great job making really good tv and bringing this to the mainstream. As far as tonight's show, the negatives were mostly surface level. By that I mean that the show deviated so far from the actual story that it started to become its own entity. (very bad for some)
The positives were that despite that deviation, the plot and the acting drew the viewer in to the story that the producers re-wrote. Backhanded compliment, I know. Yet I really was pulled in by the insight into Varys' motivation, the Tyrell's plotting, and that bitch (I mean Theon)'s plight. The pacing was quite good this week. Not for one moment did I feel the show was moving too slowly, as I did with the first three. Cat in that dream with Bran was annoying, but maybe that's because I hate Cat. Jamie and Brienne's scenes irked me at first. Mostly because they were so far off from the text, but they actually did serve to give Jamie back some of the respect he lost by not fighting Brienne "well enough" earlier in the season. The mutiny was done pretty well. No complaints there. Dany's scene at the end was f'ing phenomenal. I know how the story goes, and I have grown to dislike Dany through the course of the literature, but when she takes charge and unleashes the Unsullied and her dragon, I got chills. Well played this week gentlemen and thank the Old Gods and the New that ASOIAF is so good we can talk about the tv show that is sort of about the book series!
746	greywindsrage	2013-04-22	I feel as though I'm the only person on the boards who thinks that would be a bad idea.  But we'll see when it happens, I suppose.I agree. I actually think it should end with the RW. If both events are in this season that means the PW will be in the finale with Tyrion being accused. They shouldn't end it with him escaping.

748	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	We know that Ros left the North in search of more opportunity.  This tells me she was ambitious and had probably already reached the top of the heap at whatever brothel she had been working at.  It's entirely possible that she was involved in finances there and learned to read to further her career.  It's not like she's reading Tolstoy in this episode; she's just looking at an inventory.We all have thresholds of disbelief when consuming media.  I don't really need to know why Ros can read; I don't find it so unrealistic that I need an answer.  She is, after all, an ambitious business woman.When I said common peasant I was referring to Ros' father. I agree that Ros is not just a common peasant because obviously she is ambitious. Otherwise she wouldn't even have moved to KL.

750	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-22	PW would seem kinda crammed in if it ends the season. much better for season 4.
751	jeffklm	2013-04-22	My heart bled for Sansa when she prayed to the weirwood stump. We know that among the Stark children, she's the most devout to The Seven and with the most desire of adopting the culture of the South. But now she yearns for the North and her family, and perhaps the closest she'll ever feel like she's back in Winterfell is in front of a heart tree.
That, and the Winterfell snowcastle later in The Eyrie.
752	TheReal_Rebel	2013-04-22	]OH!!  That was PERFECT!!  I LOVE Khaleesi!!!!  I could NOT wait for this scene. I am SO grateful they kept it true!  &hearts;I keep obsessively re-watching her scene!  She truly is a Queen now!  A female Alexander.

They shouldn't end it with him escaping.PW would seem kinda crammed in if it ends the season. much better for season 4.To be honest, it could work as a cliffhanger type ending. It would also alleviate the sorrow of the Starks being massacred. The issue is that it would really mess with the timeline, and give characters like Tyrion very little to do for most of season 4, but sit in a cell for much of the time. Also, if they are introducing Mace Tyrell and Oberyn, it probably should be before the wedding.
754	TheDarkOne	2013-04-22	Thoughtsâ<U+0080>¦
*Glad Mormont finally got killed off. I hated the character in the books and in the show.
*Scenes with Joff were awesome as always. Loved seeing him wave triumphantly to the crowd.
*The stuff with Theon is gettign a little tedious, letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s get to some real torture.
*There will be no PW this season, enough.
*Dannyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scene was great.  
*Tywin laying the ground work for the RW priceless.
755	Ice Turtle	2013-04-22	Pod... that was beyond lame
I hope Willas still exist in the show universe even if he isn't betrothed to Sansa, I think it will be hard to merge his plot with Loras' after ADwD. Maybe at worst he could be Mace's younger brother, or nephew or something like that but I have a feeling that he will be important in future books.
I like the little bone they has thrown to the book fans about sigils.
I actually liked Ros few episodes past when she mentioned how it was when Sansa was born, but not this week, she is given more focus that Jon Snow, Mance, Arya and many others. Besides if show needs it's weekly fix of nudity we we weren't given the scene from the Peach? Because there would need to be actually some character development of characters that actually matter?
Watching Tywin with Cersei one has to remember his scenes with Arya last season, he had left her with the Mountain and has her taste he food he suspected to be poisoned but he still threated her warmer than his own children, or bannermen   or well anyone else...
A wish for the future: we never had it in the books but I hope for at least one Sansa/Tywn scene.
For this episode, well not bad, some really lame moments but we are almost in the middle of the season and when it comes to Arya and especially Jon and wildlings I think that so far the show is wasting some big opportunities.
PS: Parts with Joffrey, Olenna, Tywin, Margaery, Sansa Bran and Dany were good, but not being fan of torture and humiliation on screen, I didn't watch parts with Jaime and Theon. There was too little of Arya, "her" scenes so far seem to be more focused on other characters.

Was a bit short imho but ofc they wouldn't be able to make it long enough, I'd like to see the sack of Astapor in a full length movie! I thought the scene with the sorcerer Varys just got by mail (giggle) was pretty good, adds to the character as we know him from the books. 
Hated the Pod-thing again tho. What's up with that? Are they trying to throw in some American-Pie-Jokes in order to please some teenagers that can't follow the actual storyline? It's a serious show with some of the best action I've ever seen in tv-shows. Don't ruin it by throwing in stuff like that.

759	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-22	Ros' scene wasn't even focused on her it was on the lf/sansa marriage, and unless i'm forgetting something, I think the only scenes where she was the focus or one of the focus' was the shae scene earlier and after the baby is killed. 
All her scenes have  other much better characters in them so they are okay in my book, Not like she is having her own adventures by herself.

Tywin Cersei-Tywin lecturing Cersei on her responsibilities for Joffrey's behavior without acknowledging how he screwed up raising his own kids
I am not a big fan of the Theon arc this season, though it is decent, why would theon believe they were near Deepwood Motte, where did he think he just escaped from?  didnt he get a view of the castle he just escaped from?  Yes small detail and not a real issue,  a nitpick if you will.
Dracirys was awesome. Dany was outstanding in this episode, truly regal and I loved how they just had Jorah and Selmy watching her in awe.
767	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	He's KG in both. During the Blackwater episode, Tyrion specifically says, "You're King's Guard, Clegane." That's when The Hound says, "Fuck the King's Guard, fuck the city, and FUCK THE KING."Edit: /ninja.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ninja:' /> I am so behind in this thread. /huh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':huh:' />lol Yes, many people have already pointed that out. But thanks for clarifying anyways /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />  I had forgotten that moment. I already said that I was wrong. You're right, it was stablished that he was a member of the KG, but I think it wasn't pretty clearly explained or stablished. But well, at least they did stablish it. Of course Ros can read. She's helping LF run his business. And just as a matter of history, Courtezans/Geisha not only read, were well educated, and played music, they were very well versed in politics.Whores know more than you think they do, they have to be able to count their money.I know about Courtezans/Geisha, but Ros is not one. She is a whore, or well now she is running the business? I don't know exactly how to say it.You don't need to know how to read to know how to count. Just because someone doesn't know how to read, doesn't mean he/she is stupid. I had to teach adults to write and read for a school project. These people had jobs and knew how to count their money perfectly fine. They were very clever, and had experienced many things in life that I have never expirienced, and knew things that I didn't know and some that I haven't learned, yet. They just never had the opportunity or resources to learn how to read and write.

777	DrRobotnik	2013-04-22	A bit uneven until the last few scenes.
It made no sense that Mormont would set up camp at Craster's Keep. In the books, it was just to put a roof over their head until morning. Their goal was to get to the Wall as fast as possible. Why would he set up camp?
Hopefully non-book readers will be too thunderstruck by the coolness of the Night's Watch killing one another to notice the illogicality of setting up camp at Craster's Keep.
778	SerMixalot	2013-04-22	I thought the line about the wounded established that, which IIRC is consistent from the books
779	Sun	2013-04-22	I'm here to sing the praises of the Jaime/Brienne scenes. They were glorious. The highlight of a stellar episode. Great chemistry between those 2, and NCW does a truly broken Jaime justice His suicide by assholes attempt when he grabbed the sword, gave me chills. Simply wonderful.
Emilia Clark still can't act her way onto a horse, but the scoring of her scenes did for me what she could not do. Ramin Djawadi elevated that sequence to no end.
Theon made me teary when talked about ned as his real father, and I never ever feel sorry for Theon, but today that one sentence managed it.
A wonderful episode, truly.
ETA:
Oh, and Iwan Rheon, chewing scenery with the best of them. He needs to tap it down a bit on the evil eyes. Ramsay, I would hope, is a bit more subtle in his sadistic glee.

I love TV Danerys, and I feel sort of meh about book Danerys. I'm finding myself hoping TV Danerys and TV Jaime somehow get together and fall in love and do a spin-off show /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> Kidding, but TV Danerys is a total boss.
782	WeStillKnowNothingJonSnow	2013-04-22	nope, season ends with red wedding ep9 and catelyn return ep10. theyre not building up the hate induced from joffreys character. that will take next season and then a purple wedding near beginning or midway through
783	Bannerman918	2013-04-22	Has anyone ever been as hot as Dany was during that scene.  Holy moly.no, never.
784	maqzzz	2013-04-22	i cant wait for theon to realize whats happening. he'll be all angry and sweary at ramsay the next time he sees him, threatening him and what not. and then BOOM: Im ramsay, bitch!
785	Rockroi	2013-04-22	Maybe the two best episodes back-to-back in the series' history.  Let's get to it:What I liked:Slaying the Kingslayer: THe title of the episode is "And Now His Watch Is Ended" and it applied to many in the episode.  And with JAime it was the end of his life as one of the most fearsome swordsmen in Westeros.  Instead, Jaime is reduced to wanting to die, then just wanting his torment to end.  All the while, we see how cruel and helpless war can make even somebody like Jaime Lannister feel and, in some ways, become.  While I really enjoyed how BRienne interpalyed with him this episode, I thought that it was JAime the whole time that- much like the book - captivated me by exposing me to a powerful character made instantly helpless.  Much like watching Ned be brought down, Sansa held against her will, etc- watching Jaime shrink due to the barbarity of war was masterful.  And Nicolai is exceptional.  As good as any actor on the show. Fall of the Watch: Maybe one of the most underrated scenes in SoS is the revolt at Kraster's Keep as men slay each other in an orgy of blind violence, hatred, panic, fear and power gone mad.  Watching the escalation was as good (if not better) than the book, and the show captured the desparation of the NW counterposed with the villiany of Craster and his desire to be left alone.  Obviously, the big moment was Mormont's execution, and the show delivered.  I really got a taste of just how horrible thsi world was by looking at them in that scene right asthe men were pushing Craster to bring events to a head.  The excuse needed, then, to rape, pillage and murder. Rymes with Seek: Watching the ways a man can be broken is a complex mix of wonderment and pity- I am amazed to the lengths with which the show will describe how Theoin became Reek,  BUt moreover the show is contoinuing with MArtin's theme of trying to show how complicated Theon is; that while we may hate him, we still don't have to like what is happeneing to him. Tywin's Family Values: A quick but toight scene with Tywin writing and writing and Cersei patiently waiting. I loved how that scene showed just how little Tywin needed to coddle his children; he made very clear points- Cersei botched raising Joff and now they are paying for it.  Tywin has no problem giving Cersei authority, the question is, though, what is she really good for?  That scene encapsulates just how much Tywin rules over all, including the thoughts of his own children. Sophie Turner: She is portraying Sansa to a 'T'; showing us the ideal of hope ina  hopeless situation.  Turner's performance is nuanced, captivating, and real.  She's tremendous. Along Came a Spider: Maybe the hidden gem in this episode was Varys the Spider and how he slipped in and out of a host of tight talks with Roz, Tyrion and ultimately Olenna.  While Olenna had the much better lines, Varys has the more progressive story arch.  He's up to something and its not as simple or as obvious as many think.  BUt when he and Tyrion are talking he suddenly has a box and reveals to all just how horrible he can be, and how much time, patience and effort true revenge takes, you know that this man is not fucking around.  He has the capacity to be as deadly as Jaime.  THe ultimate message: Tallyrand survived- you may not if I have my way. The Fall of Astapor: Once again, there are maybe 1-2 scenes in each book that HAVE TO work or the show fails (Ned's death, the birth of dragons, Blackwater, etc).  We just got the first of the season - Dany's trump of the slavers at Astapor was a perfect high-note Either we believe it and it works, or we don't and Dany's story begins to crumble.  It was a tremendous scene.  Not a Blackwater, but a absoilutely stunning show of brains, greed, intellect, killer instinct, tension and fierce hatred.  I thought that whole scvene- from srart to finish was perfect; as good as anything in the show.But.....What I am Not Sure On:Foreplay Is There For a Reason: In the books, while we all know Dany will not give up her dragon, as the scenes develop- as each one lines up against the other, a first-time reader could EASILY be tricked into thinking that Dany would give up Drogon... at least that she is considering giving him up.  There is ample build-up to some sort of inner turmoil between Dany and her actions; a Mother possible foresaking her own child... And in a book where the main character was killed in the first book... not outside the realm of possibilities.  BUt in the show?  There is no doubt that Dany is not going to give up the dragon.  I was watching it with a few non-book readers and they all said that they KNEW she would never do it.  MY feeling is that had the show invested one or two scenes of Dany showing conflict, worry, concern, dread, fear etc- any emotion it would have gone a long way in maybe tricking the viewer into thinking "You know... she may do this..."  BUt they never invested that time so the moment was lost.  It was a simple paror trick, nothing more. In the book, Dany is really, really nervous about the whole thing; that "fear of failure"; of "crossing the Trident" is lost on the viewres.  I have no problem with Dany being confident- that's who she is.  But at least a little scared?  Nervous?  How about uncertain?  All of those emotions could have been used to pantomime distaste for her own action of selling a dragon.  That could have been huge.  People watching the show may have thought, "This bitch may sell a dragon." In ither words, while that scene worked, the overall arc was not as elegant as it could have been. Roses Are Still Red: While I love Natalie Dormer on the show, I think we all understand her influence over Joff, Cersei's fear, and how they are moving.  I think the whole scene in Balor's sept could have been cut because it retreads covered ground.  WhileI did not dislike the scene- I like the history; liked the Cersei's fear and Olenna's quips, its all rehashing stuff we already know.  Even the scene with Sansa felt overly long and- after the Olenna-VArys scene - unnecessary.  I am not saying its a fail, just awkward. What I did Not LIke:For the second week in a row, I have nothing to complain about.  I though it all looked great.  I thought they gave enough time to everything we wanted to see and experience. Unfortunately... after next week... we're half-way done...
786	Dragonstoned	2013-04-22	Anyone else annoyed by the remoulding of Brienne into a badass bitch?The latest addition to this is her telling Jaime he sounds 'like a bloody woman'.  ASoS has her saying 'are you so craven?' which was the perfect way to bring him back to life.  Show!Brienne called him a coward but it wasn't the same at all because she was just insulting him.Giving myself props for this because I called it, based on Alyssa Rosenberg's review http://asoiaf.wester...80#entry4259414 and said it would be disappointing.  It is very disappointing as Gwen Christie is great but they're really frontloading her character giving her no space for evolving like she did in the books, and have taken away Brienne's humanity which is what she brings out in Jaime.
787	maqzzz	2013-04-22	Also: to whoever complained about people showing compassion towards jaime, because they had not forgotten what he has done.
GRRM always states that he believes there is good and evil in all of his characters. i like how the show is true to the books regarding jaimes transformation. 
Jaime is the best and he will continue to transform into one of the more beloved characters on the show.
788	Weeping Sore	2013-04-22	What! Nooo. We still have to see her outsmarting a bunch of battle commanders in Yunkai!Plus- Barriston schooling the champion of Yunkai in place of Strong Belwas!  Though I doubt he will shit afterward.
789	Janicia	2013-04-22	Ros wasn't a "low class village whore".  She lived very close to (in?) Winterfell. Winterfell was ruled by people who cared about the common folk - they might have provided basic education to the smallfolk.  She was one of the top prostitutes there - Theon's favorite and the one that Tyrion initially chose to spend time with.  She seems to have taken the initiative to research Tyrion before his arrival.  When she got a windfall, she took the initiative to move to the capital and landed in a high class brothel immediately, and quickly rose through the ranks there (spying on Pycelle in S1, acting more as a madam in S2).  She has been consistently portrayed as an intelligent, ambitious woman.  
Ros's relationship with the Lannisters is interesting.  Tyrion's generosity allowed her to get to the city, but then she had to watch a baby ripped from its mother and murdered at Joffrey's orders.  Then Tyrion sent to that awful experience with Joffrey.  She was beaten and imprisoned by Cersei - I imagine she told Cersei's guards that she wasn't with Tyrion but wasn't believed, but face to face with Tyrion she played the part he wanted her to.  I think she's hiding her grudges behind her smiles, because there isn't anything else she can do... yet.  
I get the feeling that the people who hate the character haven't even been paying attention to her.
790	MoA«t	2013-04-22	lol Yes, many people have already pointed that out. But thanks for clarifying anyways /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />  I had forgotten that moment. I already said that I was wrong. You're right, it was stablished that he was a member of the KG, but I think it wasn't pretty clearly explained or stablished. But well, at least they did stablish it.I know about Courtezans/Geisha, but Ros is not one. She is a whore, or well now she is running the business? I don't know exactly how to say it.You don't need to know how to read to know how to count. Just because someone doesn't know how to read, doesn't mean he/she is stupid. I had to teach adults to write and read for a school project. These people had jobs and knew how to count their money perfectly fine. They were very clever, and had experienced many things in life that I have never expirienced, and knew things that I didn't know and some that I haven't learned, yet. They just never had the opportunity or resources to learn how to read and write.She is a whore in a fantasy universe. She also doesn't fuck 24/7. She has other time in the day to learn to read. Perhaps the Madame she worked for in King's Landing taught her. Or do you think that someone who ran a business like a brothel would actually be illiterate?The stubborness on the ROS CAN'T READ thought process is baffling.

791	Rockroi	2013-04-22	As far as Roz goes - let me begin by saying that I do not like the character at all; she is a low-point for me in the show.  I find her inslusion to be a chatch-all character who is there when others cannot be; she is a stand-in for about 5 other characters in the show, thus making the universe seem strangely smaller; her "rise" is ludicrious in both time and in space- she went from Winterfell to KIng's LAnding for reasons that were never made clear, thus making the universe seem trivial and silly.  She is the epitome of lazy writing.
But I get why she is there.  And this week I had no problem with her hat she added to the episode.  See, I think GoT NEEDS to have some levity; some light air to chop up all th eheavy and dour scenes; a few jokes to try to counter-balance against all the, well, death destruction and rape.  Its necessary or the show would be, well, not only a downer, but a show that took itself WAYYYYYYYYY too seriously (think the third Matrix movie).  I think Roz, this week, was fun!  HEr and Varys knocking back and forth about Pod was fun!  Why can't we have fun? 
Its when they expand the character's foot-print that makes me sour.  She is a minor, third-level character and her inclusion is such a vast array of scenes is sometimes silly.
792	MoA«t	2013-04-22	Also for the 1st time I noticed that they have a small Twins set on the opening montage.  It doesnt rise up but it is there.You fly over it right after Riverrun. I saw it last week when we first saw RR. It's like Yunkai.
793	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	Anyone else annoyed by the remoulding of Brienne into a badass bitch?The latest addition to this is her telling Jaime he sounds 'like a bloody woman'.

I already mentioned that I didn't like that line here and in the nitpick thread. That line was so OOC IMO. Brienne is not like all the women in Westeros, but she still sees the strength in women. She was impressed by how strong Catelyn was, and that's why she decided to serve her. In the books she recognizes that women are strong, but nobody gives them credit when she said "many women die in childbirth, but no one sings songs about them" or something along those lines. However, here with that line she is stating that women are weak, whining bitches that give up extremely easily. I think that sounded very bad coming from Brienne who IS a woman, and I think that was very out of character.

From the interviews I've seen and read with Gwendoline Christie, she really "gets" Brienne. Her performance is good. It's the writing I have trouble with. I'm not sure if it's the writers not getting the character, or a deliberate choice to make her more like a badass than a brave-yet-unsure woman without a real place in this society. Maybe it's too nuanced of a thing to come across on TV, because we don't get the benefit of Brienne's internal monologue. I'm really missing some of the tidbits like her thinking back to her training with Tarth's master-at-arms, the banquet where she met Renly, her past encounters with suitors. Those really show us who Brienne is. I was kind of bummed with the "like a bloody woman" instead of "are you so craven?" too. It also took away from Jaime's character. No one has ever accused him of being craven.ETA - Reading Dunk & Egg helped me to understand Brienne even more. She is Dunk.

I think that sounded very bad coming from Brienne who IS a woman, and I think that was very out of character.Yep, unlike some characters (Cersei) she doesn't reject or bemoan her gender, she is just a woman in a nearly exclusively male profession.ITA. From the interviews I've seen and read with Gwendoline Christie, she really "gets" Brienne. Her performance is good. It's the writing I have trouble with.She really does, and from interviews NCW obviously gets Jaime too (he is facking superb).  I think the actors understand their characters clearer than the writers do - Jaime is better done than Brienne but even he is scripted as doing things that Martin's Jaime would hardly contemplate (killing his relative, also saying to Brienne 'we don't get to choose who we love' which is way early for him to open up to her - a redemption arc accelerated too soon, like Theon in this episode repenting already).Basically D&D need to take a backseat and let GC and NCW write their own scripts!

Show!Brienne is much more hardened by life already, and I don't necessarily have a problem with that, but some of the things she said like the "bloody woman" line, it's something book Brienne would have never said in a million years. I think they're bringing to the surface Brienne's conflict with who she is- a woman- and what she wants to be- a knight, and how the two things don't seem to be able to coexist. At least that's my take so far.However, I still think they're showing Brienne's humanity. When Jaime is being beaten up, she tries to help but she's stopped and she's horrified and sad at what's happening to him. And as harsh as what she said to him was, it sounded like tough love. She's puzzled by his actions- lying to save her whenever he was threatening to kill her himself not so long ago, but she doesn't think highly of him and it shows, however she's humane enough to want to him to pull through. Also, practically speaking, she needs him to be alive otherwise her task is fruitless. I think show Brienne is naive in the way she sees the world and people as good or bad, but also quite pragmatic. She's more grown up.
798	Jamie Lannister	2013-04-22	Ros didn't bother me this episode. I thought it was a fairly easy way to tease both Varys and the audience as to what LF will be up to in a few episodes' time.
It dragged on a bit maybe, but nowhere near as bad as that bloody Pod scene in #3.
					
					
							Edited by Jamie Lannister, 22 April 2013 - 10:07 AM.
799	StarkDragon	2013-04-22	I'm surprised so many are upset with Brienne. 
We had earlier this season Jaime calling her too much man for Renly, and IIRC constantly harassing her for being a woman and a warrior, as if being a woman is so contrary to being a warrior.
So she throws it back in his face. 
Or, that's how I interpreted it.
800	Sun	2013-04-22	What I am Not Sure On:Foreplay Is There For a Reason: In the books, while we all know Dany will not give up her dragon, as the scenes develop- as each one lines up against the other, a first-time reader could EASILY be tricked into thinking that Dany would give up Drogon... at least that she is considering giving him up.

Her face and eyes should have shown her inner struggle. Unfortunately, Emilia is not a good enough actress to pull it off, though she did try, most markedly in the shot of her opening the dragon box.
801	Maria Underfoot	2013-04-22	Does anyone think that the producers might change Dany's storyline? That last scene was really powerful and seemed to suggest that Dany is ready to come to Westeros...I have a bad feeling that they'll deviate from the book and skip the whole sitting-at-Meereen-doing nothing part, because they won't want to disappoint viewers, who adore Dany
802	Tyrion4President	2013-04-22	I feel as though I'm the only person on the boards who thinks that would be a bad idea.  But we'll see when it happens, I suppose.Its confirmed that the book was split into 2 seasons. There isnt enough time this season to have all 3 weddings. We still havent met Oberyn and i doubt they are going to rush 3 weddings this seaons only to have tyrions trial drag on for all of next season
803	Muttley	2013-04-22	The literacy... yes that's a bit out there, but maybe she just had a lot of time and access to Winterfell's library?  Okay... it's a stretch.Seeing as she was in Winterfell all that time, maybe she was a "favourite" of Maester Luwin and he taught her to read as part payment...  /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
804	Sun	2013-04-22	Does anyone think that the producers might change Dany's storyline?

805	Sun	2013-04-22	The farther we get into this season, the more I think both the Red and Purple weddings are going to happen this year.I doubt it. I think Sansa's wedding will take priority for Tywin and delay PW till next season. But we'll see.
806	cybobbie	2013-04-22	Simply loved the episode, missed some things that I was hoping for, like Sam final scene with the Old Bear, but despite the changes the episode was still awesome.The Sansa/Loras proposal won't last long, and Tywin may put Loras in the KG specifically to prevent the marriage, then set up Sansa/Tyrion.I guess that this would be a good way to prevent the wedding, but still not sure if they will use it.I'm surprised so many are upset with Brienne.We had earlier this season Jaime calling her too much man for Renly, and IIRC constantly harassing her for being a woman and a warrior, as if being a woman is so contrary to being a warrior.So she throws it back in his face.Or, that's how I interpreted it.I second that, I mean I didn't see the scene at all as Brienne pointing out that women are weak, but as a way to reply to Jaime's previous comments on women. I really love in the show almost as much I did in the books the relationship between Jaime and Brienne.

I will keep watching because of the dwarf , since  Ned is dead  and  he is the only  alive person in the show that i  admire.
Btw idk how it will end  but

I already explained better.When I said common peasant I was referring to Ros' father. I agree that Ros is not just a common peasant because obviously she is ambitious. Otherwise she wouldn't even have moved to KL.
812	Honey Badger	2013-04-22	However, I still think they're showing Brienne's humanity. When Jaime is being beaten up, she tries to help but she's stopped and she's horrified and sad at what's happening to him. And as harsh as what she said to him was, it sounded like tough love. She's puzzled by his actions- lying to save her whenever he was threatening to kill her himself not so long ago, but she doesn't think highly of him and it shows, however she's humane enough to want to him to pull through.

She's more grown up.Jaime is a little complicated.  He has great guilt over watching the Starks get gutted and cooked alive by Aerys with him just standing there.  There's no problem in killing if there's a sword in your hand and it's a fair fight.  I think Brienne has the same guilt over Renly and wants to see Jaime given fair treatment.
813	SelanSnow	2013-04-22	Exactly they cycle through whores in the books, because no one whore is able to gain any prominence in Westeros due to the profession being looked down upon. Anyone who uses whores does not respect them, or casts them aside when they are no longer wanted. It shows the lack of empathy the characters have for women who have lived hard lives, rather than showing how anyone can make a name for themselves in Westeros as long as they're willing to get naked.Alayaya ran her brothel, didn't she?
814	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	Alayaya ran her brothel, didn't she?Nope. Chataya did. Alayaya's mother.
815	Lady Lea	2013-04-22	Anyone else annoyed by the remoulding of Brienne into a badass bitch?The latest addition to this is her telling Jaime he sounds 'like a bloody woman'.  ASoS has her saying 'are you so craven?' which was the perfect way to bring him back to life.  Show!Brienne called him a coward but it wasn't the same at all because she was just insulting him.I agree completely. This show also gave Arya that classic line "most girls are stupid". Sure. Because for Brienne and Arya to be "cool women" they have to show they are not like the rest of us simpering weaklings. "Women suck!!! LOLZ I am so much better because I'm not like them! Please like me!"Brienne in the books has nothing but respect for women. She talks about a woman's courage and says dying in childbirth is just like dying in battle, except no one sings about the women. Brienne is great. Show!Brienne is just a reflection of D&D's sexism.

You should read the books. They are totally awesome!!

Show!Brienne is just a reflection of D&D's sexism.Yeah and Show!Brienne is already quite radically altered from the book version. She's been turned into an embittered, fairly ruthless killer, whereas in the books she was naive, innocent, feminine, and incredibly awkward. I think D&D missed all that and just ran with "female warrior".
818	Akal Colzet	2013-04-22	I'm sure some whores in Westeros can read even if it's not the norm. Considering we have telepathy and dragons I don't reallt feel it's stretching suspension of disbelief all that much.
819	Blue Steel	2013-04-22	What is Varys up to?
The show makes it look like he suggested the Sansa/Loras match.  Wouldn't a Tyrell-Stark alliance work against his plans?  If the Tyrells are allied with the Lannisters and the Starks, then wouldn't that make it harder for Aegon to conquer?
Unless he knows that the Lannisters will find out about the Tyrell plans and marry Sansa to Tyrion instead, which would somehow benefit Aegon. That is some next level shit right there if true.
Edit: Nevermind, there's already a thread on this in this forum.

820	JMJ	2013-04-22	Overall, awesome episode. My random observations/thoughts:
- Mormont's death was badass and sad. When he spat up blood and realized he was going down, that was really sad, but I liked how he spat it into Rast's face.
- Sam and Gilly running away from Craster's and Mormont laying dying means very likely there will be no dying wish of Jeor to forgive Jorah. That's too bad.
- Ramsay's reveal was excellent. That evil grin was chilling!
- Tywin's writing, writing writing. I wonder if non-readers will realize the foreshadowing - this is clearly Tywin planning the Red Wedding.
- Dany's sack of Astapor - that was executed perfectly. I can barely imagine the show doing a better job with that (short of having an unlimited budget and 8000 extras). I wonder if this means the show's opening credits will now show Yunkai instead of Astapor.
- Started another thread about this, but what's up with sorcerer-in-a-box? I don't know if they plan this to be a one-time deal, or if it's going to be a recurring and significant change to the storyline?
- Did not like the Bran dream scene. Seemed too short to have been needed in this episode. Sure, we know Bran is having dreams. Perhaps there's a foreshadowing of Lady Stoneheart, but that could have all happened in either E03 or E05.
- RE: Ros. First, I swear Ros-hate will become an internet meme. I don't like the character, not because of the deviation from the books, but because she so far has just simply not been very interesting. Perhaps she's just a vehicle to have LF or Varys insight, but that would be lame. My theory is, like some others have suggested, that she will be Dontos. This was perhaps foreshadowed in E03 when she says to Shae to watch out for LF with Sansa. I highly doubt she herself will substitute for Jeyne/(F)Arya. She's too old and no one in the North would believe it.
821	ShigellaSand	2013-04-22	On the whole, a brilliant episode. Sure, a couple of minor things bugged me a little bit, but they were just that - minor.
Well played with Theon's regrets, I thought. Isn't it so often the case that it's when people are down and out that they start not only second-guessing themselves, but also thinking about the ones who could've helped them if only... I kinda wished the scene hadn't been so very dark, so I could've seen his face better as he talked about Balon and Robb and Ned and the miller's boys - but then it soon became apparent why it had to be so dark in there.
Great Jaime/Brienne scenes. Another step towards making show viewers see another side to Jaime, feel for him, despite everything. The look on Brienne's face when he started swaying in the saddle, when they "watered" him, when they kicked him as he was done... Powerful stuff. And yeah, maybe she would've chosen her words better if they'd been intended for a larger audience, but she was speaking to Jaime, so she said what she thought would work on him. Made sense to me.
Tywin and Cersei, simply brilliant. All these Lannisters play so wonderfully off each other. Their messed-up family dynamics are a joy to behold. Such a gold mine for character building, and it drives the plot so that nothing they do to each other really surprises you when you look back, even if you didn't see it coming beforehand. And of course, Joffrey is the absolutely perfect person to drop some background info about the more gruesome aspects of Targaryen history. And Margaery is so sneaky while looking so innocent, knowing exactly what to say to each person to make them do what she wants, whether it's Joffrey or Sansa.
Varys, and the Queen of Thorns, in a scene together. That alone would've made me like this episode. From "May I sit?" "No," all the way to "It seems rather obvious to me," that scene was pure gold.
They led up to the Mycah accusation very well, I think, what with the talk of dead children and the Hound rightly pointing out he wasn't responsible for them. Beric calling Arya the bravest of them all seemed a little heavy-handed, but I'll allow it since it didn't cost him anything to say so, and since he did respect her father a great deal, so he might be willing to indulge a young girl who's been through a lot in the past year.
Craster's. Ah, Mormont. And so your watch is ended. I did like the little detail about him asking where Bonnen was from - being a good leader doesn't automatically mean he can remember everything about every single man under him. Dolorous Edd got in a comment or two, as well, and Sam got to be an infatuated boy with his foot firmly stuck in his mouth around Gilly. Asking what the boy's name was, really? Talk about rubbing salt in wounds! Poor sweet thoughtless Sam, so well-meaning. But ah, Mormont. You will be missed.
Dracarys! There was a little moment there when Dany asked if the Unsullied would follow her as free men, and they started beating their spears on the ground, where Barristan and Jorah exchanged looks. Just a look, but it said so much. At a moment like that, their differences didn't mean anything. It was all about Dany. Wonderful end to a wonderful episode.
822	Tyrion4President	2013-04-22	I thought they were foreshadowing the showdown between Tywin and Joffrey, when Joff answers back and says that Robert won all the battles and Tywin was hiding during the Rebellion.  Or some variation of that we will see in the tv show.This scene in the book got me soo hyped up. I can only imagine how much energy tywin had to use to keep himself from slappin the sh*t out of joffrey. IMO this is when they realize they have completely lost control of Joff
823	MyLittleDirewolf	2013-04-22	I agree completely. This show also gave Arya that classic line "most girls are stupid". Sure. Because for Brienne and Arya to be "cool women" they have to show they are not like the rest of us simpering weaklings. "Women suck!!! LOLZ I am so much better because I'm not like them!

Show!Brienne is just a reflection of D&D's sexism.I hear ya. GRRM wrote some incredible female characters in ASOIAF. It's a shame they aren't translating well onto the show. It seems like they are simply going for the BAMF factor and not complex characters who are not wishing they were born men (Cersei being the exception, she does wish she had been born a man in both 'verses) or have a low opinion of other women. I miss the Mormont women, but who knows what D&D would do with them.
824	jamesrivers	2013-04-22	While I'm all for Ros having the same fate as Dontos did. I think we are going to see Dontos again. I recall a recent interview with David and Dan and they mentioned we haven't seen the last of Dontos. So, being a little purist to the books, I would love to see Dontos take part in Sansa's escape of King's Landing.
825	Brewmaster	2013-04-22	How would this be possible? Oberyn Martell has not even been mentioned by name yet, and he and Tyrion have already befriended each other by the time of the Purple Wedding. How will Oberyn volunteer to be Tyrion's champion when he has not even arrived at King's Landing? Oberyn doesn't need to befriend Tyrion. They do end up being jovial to each other, but he doesn't offer to be Tyrion's champion out of friendship. The only reason he chooses to do so is to get revenge on the Mountain.There is no need for him to be there at the wedding to be Tyrion's champion, because his trial doesn't take place at that time.
826	Son of Gendry	2013-04-22	I feel as though I'm the only person on the boards who thinks that would be a bad idea.  But we'll see when it happens, I suppose.Agree. I'd actually like them to start season 4 off with a bang and do the purple wedding then
827	David Selig	2013-04-22	Great episode except for the Brienne's comments to Jaime which are problematic for many reasons, and the moronic "Pod the Sex God" plotline.
 Dracarys was such an awesome scene, really gave me goosebumps. This should put an end to the "Emilia can't act' claims.
 Conleth Hill is such a great Varys, always spot on.
 I am not liking the direction the showrunners've chosen for the Tv Brienne, to be honest. She's already a ruthless killer, and now the first argument she used to convince Jaime not to give up was for revenge. "You sound like a woman" in this context was really odd coming from her. Especially since her "you have a woman's courage" comment to Cat was in the show IIRC.
828	Son of Gendry	2013-04-22	However,I was a bit sad to not get Jeor Mormont's last words to Sam about wanting Jorah to come home and take the black.Yeh, while realizing they can't capture everything, I thought that was an important moment and wouldn't have taken much time. I see it as an oversight similar to Jon Snow giving Mace his reason why he "deserted." I thought the "bastard" reasoning would have been much better (given in the book) than the Craster's Keep reasoning. Would have been perfect to show the Old Bear giving Sam the message and then moving directly to a frame of Jorah in Astapor for the final scene.
829	Rhyella Targaryen	2013-04-22	Why am I starting to fear no Coldhands....?
830	Son of Gendry	2013-04-22	So who is bigger? Pod or Tormund?
I didn't really get the purpose of the Varys/Sorcerer scene.
I may be wrong, but doesn't letting Ramsay know that Bran and Rickon are alive damage some of the dynamics of the plot down the line?
Final scene...best scene of the series by far.

831	flyersfan2588	2013-04-22	The farther we get into this season, the more I think both the Red and Purple weddings are going to happen this year.Yea I agree. But I agree with Landed Knight too, both weddings would be too much. I could see the Purple Wedding happening by like episode 3 of next season though.
832	ChozenOne	2013-04-22	I thought this episode was great! Probably in the top 3 of the series for me.
I thought the Pod/whores scene form E03 was funny. The continuation was a bit weird, but the Varys story about his junk getting sacrificed to the red god, combined with the dumbing down of sorcery being associated with red god (Melisandre and Jaqen) gives me a crazy idea.  What if they're setting up Pod to get his magic dick burnt in a brazier like Varys, courtesy of Lady Stoneheart and the brotherhood, who also worship the red god, for some crazy fire magic ritual? Don't know why, just a crazy thought.
I loved everything Dany this episode, and i'm not a big fan of hers. Dracarys was perfect! Ramsay's creepy look was also great, and did he totally change his voice at the end of that scene or is it just me?
Craster's was great too! I think Rast's line about killing Sam soon is forshadowing him as a wight. Instead of small Paul it will be Rast about to kill Sam and Gilly when Coldhands comes to the rescue on his great elk with his murder of crows! I wouldn't worry about Sam the slayer not happening. Fat guy and girl with baby will be slow, Grenn will catch up, see it, and they'll get split up again.
Mormont's dying wish could still happen. They could always have him tell Ed or Grenn before they leave Craster's. Probably not though. Great episode!

834	TheButcherCrow	2013-04-22	I may be wrong, but doesn't letting Ramsay know that Bran and Rickon are alive damage some of the dynamics of the plot down the line?Well in the books it was Ramsay who came up with the whole "switcheroo" in the first place, he was disguised as Reek remember?
835	LastDragonLives	2013-04-22	I just don't get why everyone on here is loving this season so much.  Yes last night's episode was better, but they could have had more action during the scene at Astapor, the carnage starts, and then we just see an explosion behind Dany's head.  The sorceror thing was ok, but not necessary.  Same with the stupid Podrick plot that was never in the books, why is this still part of the story?  I'm not advocating a word by word translation, but they should be taking things that are not necessary out (such as Catelyn's monolouges with her dying father), not adding new storylines.  In the end it will change the whole story.  As the series continues I think they will go further and further from the books which I don't like.  Theon isn't even in book 3, why is he even in this season?  The first season was still the best, it followed the book as well as it could, had the most action, and was by far more thrilling.  Its still OK, but I am disappointed.
836	LastDragonLives	2013-04-22	I doubt we'll see both Red and Purple weddings. RW and Sansa's yes. Otherwise its too much squeezed in to too short a season.Definitely won't happen.  The season will probably end just after the Red Wedding.  Which will obviously leave the non-readers horrified.  One thing I am definitely excited about.  How they already don't know what happens from friends already is beyond me, that was spoiled for me when I started book 3, thanks to co-workers.
837	HoundDog	2013-04-22	Does anyone else think that its weird we've yet to even hear the name "Frey" used this season?  Considering the impact they are going to have in only six episodes it seems like an oversight.  They've done a good job setting up Boltons and next week Karstark but I wish we heard more about how pissed Late Lord Walder is.

844	bscharm	2013-04-22	i really liked this scene. got a little choked up, not gonna lie. i always felt that was how theon felt deep down. i liked this addition.I always felt it deep down as well, but I also felt it was important that it was never truly revealed in the books, as we were able to form our own opinions about Theon.  It just took me much longer when reading than watching. In the books there were many times where I would think "this is what he deserves", I fear that won't happen in the show and people will just feel sorry for him.
845	Gran de Lys	2013-04-22	This is the second episode where Brienne has made a comment about women being weak. The first could be seen as striking at Jaime's pride. Here? Internalized Misogyny? Deliberate? Unfortunate? I'm honestly not sure how I feel about it.Sorry to reach back so far through the thread, but it's mainly cultural, I think. That "woman are weak" is all she's ever heard about her sex, and the women and girls around her are the ones who internalized it and made that characterization a self-fulfilling prophecy. Between the times, the culture, and the lack of an opposing viewpoint or living example (I mean, Nymeria, I guess, so long ago), it must take someone of great strength of character to reject all of that and decide that, if that's what a woman is, she sure as hell wasn't going to be one. Brienne took it upon herself to say that biology is not destiny, and even so, as you see with the icky group wager for maidenhead, and the attempted rapes, her biology sure looks like destiny from where the men are standing. Poor Brienne. I think what she is saying to Jaime is "You sound like the opposite of who you are (weak), and incidentally, that's the opposite of who I am to (woman, shorthand for weak)."On a darker note: Step one, cut a hole in the box/Step two, put your mage in a box ...

As with many readers those were some of my favorite chapters in the books so I hope they handle them delicately and correctly. Theon is already broken in ADWD. We do get a lot of this story that is being shown, but it's only in Theon's thoughts. Theon spends a lot of time remembering the torture and torment that Ramsay put him through. The show is showing it chronologically, and keeping Theon in the show.I don't think it's such a big deal when you start to feel sorry for him. The big deal is that he's the thoroughly broken mess that is Reek 2 years from now.
847	Grand Miester Flash	2013-04-22	@ Commoner those theon scences had to be quite effective to make anyone including myself feel a shred of sympathy for that creep.
848	Peptalk	2013-04-22	Loved this episode. Always love every scene with Jaime and Brienne, but Jack Gleeson was absoulutely wonderful in delivering his opening line about how Rhaenyra was fed to her brother's dragon. He's just so damn awesome at selling psycho.  
And I'm loving to watch Cersei turn into her psycho paranoid self too. Some people have been disliking Lena Headey's portrayal of Cersei, but it's starting to show why they chose her now.

As with many readers those were some of my favorite chapters in the books so I hope they handle them delicately and correctly.There's a lot of hate among fans towards Sandor Clegane for killing a 12-year-old boy suspected of attacking a prince who Sandor was assigned to guard (and, it's implied, killing him on the queen's orders); but Theon does get some sympathy for being tortured, despite his having murdered two younger boys to save face because the Stark children outwitted him.  Both actions are reprehensible; but I blame Theon more than I blame Sandor.  Although I feel sorry for Theon for being tortured, because I don't think anyone deserves what was done to him, I still want him to pay with his life for the two innocent lives he decided to take.  Alfie Allen did a fine job in his scenes last night, though.

851	jons nissa	2013-04-22	i'm confused. do people really believe tywin knows and will be a part of the purple wedding because he told cersei he would do something about joff? why would he remove his own grandson from the throne especially when tommen is so young? he wants to get joffrey in line. that is the only logical thing he could mean by that. he tells cersei he is glad someone can manipulate him not that he needs to go. and he wants to be the one doing the manipulated, not the tyrells.varys also doesn't know about it. he just wants to keep sansa from littlefinger (sadly not for altruistic reasons) to get back at him. he just wanted to drop the hint to the QoT to have a reason to keep sansa from lf - a marriage.cat's "promise me" made me think more of lyanna than lady stoneheart. i think we will get access to the backflashes through bran. helps pump up his mysticism to the viewers.i seem to be in the minority but i really don't like that theon says "my real father lost his head in king's landing." i think that makes no sense and is out of character. theon was a ward. ned treated him well but at arms distance. it would have made more sense to have him say something like the man i wished i was like or something but having a hostage say his captor was a real father is too twisted.loved, loved, LOVED danaerys. cried for mormont. but also made me realize that being lord commander is a treacherous job. people tend to drop like flies.
852	jons nissa	2013-04-22	oh, and yeah, sandor was totally a member of the kingsguard.
853	polarbear	2013-04-22	Tywin was not involved in the purple wedding murder, but i believe the writers will want the audience to consider him a suspect in the whodunit over the subsequent episodes.

I like that the guy who plays Edmure was also Brutus in the "Rome" series on HBO.  He must always play weak characters.  Honestly I can't wait until the Red Wedding.  They better make that scene gruesome.  There seems like there is a lot less gore in this season than the last two.  And less sex so far as well.  Except for the Podrick thing whcih they couldn't show because he is a minor.  Not sure what they are trying to do with that other than some humor, if they weave that into the plot as a Littlefinger scheme or something it would be pretty weak.
856	Ampris	2013-04-22	So the sorcerer in the box. Anybody think the show will merge this character with Maester Qyburn?Qyburn was in Harrenhal when Robb arrived. He was the only survivor.

858	polarbear	2013-04-22	Its confirmed that the book was split into 2 seasons. There isnt enough time this season to have all 3 weddings. We still havent met Oberyn and i doubt they are going to rush 3 weddings this seaons only to have tyrions trial drag on for all of next seasonWe need to have the Lysa/Littlefinger marriage this season too! (doesnt that marriage have a 'colorful' nickname also?). There should be an episode where they crosscut between all four weddings.

I was worried a bit because The Mutiny and Dracarys are two of my favorite moments in ASOS and I really didn't want them screwed up but...they totally did them justice! Dracarys was by far the best Dany moment of the show so far and The Mutiny was very. very well directed.

I miss the Mormont women, but who knows what D&D would do with them.Margaery is more complex on the show than in the books. She and  her grandmother are good examples of females who demonstrate their skill and intelligence through mastery of more feminine powers. Instead of just whining about not being born men, they embrace being women.  You could probably add Mel to the list as well.
861	JMJ	2013-04-22	Burn Gorman was awesome.  Why can't he have a proper part?YES!!! He was seriously scary good. The part going to Craster along the lines of, "you daughter fucking bastard" gave me the creeps.
862	BronnFan	2013-04-22	Burn Gorman was awesome.  Why can't he have a proper part?I support this notion. If they can work Ros into the last three seasons why not this guy?
863	polarbear	2013-04-22	I know about Courtezans/Geisha, but Ros is not one. She is a whore, or well now she is running the business? I don't know exactly how to say it.Vogarro's whore was a whore too. Didnt stop her from building a significant enterprise.
864	Nictarion	2013-04-22	Why was there no KG with Joffrey and Cersei at the sept of Baelor? Joffrey steps outside to a crowd of thousands and all I saw guarding him was city watch.
865	john	2013-04-22	YES!!! He was seriously scary good. The part going to Craster along the lines of, "you daughter fucking bastard" gave me the creeps.It was a bit odd that he came out of nowhere just to put craster down but I guess it would have been out of character for Rast to do it.It was a good scene, had the same sort of menace as in the book when you realise the NW is full of seriously bad men who don't necessarily like to take orders.I could totally see that guy stabbing Kit Harrington to death in a few seasons time.
866	Ampris	2013-04-22	i seem to be in the minority but i really don't like that theon says "my real father lost his head in king's landing." i think that makes no sense and is out of character. theon was a ward. ned treated him well but at arms distance. it would have made more sense to have him say something like the man i wished i was like or something but having a hostage say his captor was a real father is too twisted.Theon wanted to be a Stark. Makes sense then that he would consider Ned his father.

As a boy, he had lived in fear of Starkâ<U+0080><U+0099>s stern face and great dark sword. His wife was, if anything, even more distant and suspicious.
868	Despot	2013-04-22	One of the best episodes so far. Excellent.
Let's start with the obvious - the Astapor scene was perfect. After a while, I really liked Emilia Clarke's acting. She is a beautiful women, no doubt, but somehow - after season one -   she didn't really persuade me that she IS Daenerys, the mother of dragons, the queen, the person who is natural born leader. Up to now. But now, she really sounded right - i hope she will continue to act so. Whole scene was near to perfection, I think, with that music...Phenomenal.
Next, Tywin & Cercei scene. Also brilliant. I need to say that Lena Headey played part in (for me) some of the best scenes in the series - a dialog with Robert at season one, for example, and now, this. Kudos to her, really. And of course, to Charles Dance. After a "caring parent" role that he had at season two (scenes with Arya) I'm really satisfied with this return to good old basics. This is Tywin. And Charles Dance is a perfect fellow to be Tywin.  
Pleeeeaseee, give us a proper Tywin & Joffrey duel scene. That is a perfect opportunity to show us Tywin at his best.
Varys & Tyrion scene : Very good, I liked it. Why? Because, I think it shows - to a non- book audience - who really Varys is. Not a soft- voice eunuch who is - nobody knows why - just a master of spies - but a patient, intelligent and above all dangerous man. Even book readers don't know,at this point, what is Varys's goal in the "Game of thrones" - but, whatever it is, we know that he is working on that for years. This scene shows that side of Varys. Long term planner.
I apologize for eventual mistakes, I'm not a native speaker.

They did show Gorman eyeing one of Craster's wives in E03, so it fits IMO. Re: the Jon Snow stabbing, I honestly didn't see Bowen Marsh and his team as nearly as vicious or evil. Marsh and team seemed more misguided than anything. But it does highlight the LC job has quite a bit of job insecurity.
870	A Real Dire Wolf	2013-04-22	Loved this one. The Dracarys scene was a real "punch the air and shout YES" awesome moment for me when I read the books, and the show made it even better.
Is the Pod thing building up to something relevant, or...?
As a book reader, pretty much everything the Tyrell women to or about Joffrey seems really ominous. "It is for mothers to protect our sons from the grave." "Would you like to see me [kill something]?" Brrrr! /uhoh.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':uhoh:' />
871	JMJ	2013-04-22	So, do you all think they will change the opening credits to show Yunkai next week?
872	Honourable Ser	2013-04-22	Yeah but Barristan Selmy and Jorah Mormont. They didn't say a word and managed to steal the show. I'm still having to clean up I enjoyed it that much.
873	High_Heart_Hag	2013-04-22	Did Catelyn in Brans dream make everyone else think of Lady Stoneheart?Definite foreshadowing on that account.  She's going to rock in her role as undead Cat.  But i guess they're waiting for the next episode on the undead Beric reveal?
874	MoA«t	2013-04-22	Oberyn doesn't need to befriend Tyrion. They do end up being jovial to each other, but he doesn't offer to be Tyrion's champion out of friendship. The only reason he chooses to do so is to get revenge on the Mountain.There is no need for him to be there at the wedding to be Tyrion's champion, because his trial doesn't take place at that time. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />Everyone acts as though Oberyn is there because of the wedding, when he's not. He's there to join the Small Council because of the Myrcella exchange. There is really no reason he needs to be at the wedding, especially now we have Tywin as an additional possible poisoner.
875	High_Heart_Hag	2013-04-22	I feel like the only fan/viewer who found much of the Dany shots and soundtrack cheesy.  Yes, cheesy.  I'm not trying to be a hater. I wanted to love her ballsy move just as I did while reading.  But I can't help but see these scenes ending up on The Soup. It was like cringing during Dune or Waterworld when the sets were noticeable. Everything else was great, but as soon as the Unsullied changed formation with their shields glistening in the sunset I couldn't help but laugh at how much the scene evoked 300 ... in a bad way. It was a jarring contrast to the aesthetic of every other episode up to this point.  That could have been a good thing, but it was a fail from my perspective.

878	Brewmaster	2013-04-22	Are you suggesting Oberyn might be eliminated in the show?I think the suggestion is that he doesn't need to be there for the wedding to still be there for the trial.
879	MoA«t	2013-04-22	Are you suggesting Oberyn might be eliminated in the show?Nope. I'm pretty sure I didn't remotely say, "suggest", or infer anything of the sort. But 10/10 for reading words in my post that I didn't write. /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />I'm saying we can have the PW without him, this season, then introduce him in ep1 in S4. In fact, we don't need him to be at the PW at all. He just needs to be Tyrion's champion, and that relationship can happen after the PW, even if it's next season. I for one, think the PW makes the most sense this season. /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' /> It would be nice to have an entire season without a wedding.I know others have suggested that Bronn could take Oberyn's place like Loras is taking Willas's place, but I think we need to get the Dornish into the story sooner, rather than later, and I for one don't want to drown in the ocean of tears if they were to cut The RV.I think the suggestion is that he doesn't need to be there for the wedding to still be there for the trial. /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />

Makes sense then that he would consider Ned his father.i totally get theon wanting to be a stark. i do not think it makes sense for a hostage to consider his captor his father.Lord Eddard had tried to play the father from time to time, but to Theon he had always remained the man who&rsquo;d brought blood and fire to Pyke and taken him from his home. As a boy, he had lived in fear of Stark&rsquo;s stern face and great dark sword. His wife was, if anything, even more distant and suspicious.thanks for the quote lady lea! i'm not a purist by any means but i think given what the show has shown of ned and theon this was out of character.

882	total1402	2013-04-22	Some really good scenes in this episode, but I feel we could have traded some of the Kings Landing scenes for some of Jon. I want to hear Ygritte say "You know nothin Jon Snow" again god dammit! They all revolve around people doing things about Sansa. The initial scene with Olenna was meant to have the marriage proposal but those scenes did drag it out. It was cute to see Sansa react to the proposal by Marg; but I can't help but feel like shes a supporting character not one of the main ones.
Top three scenes are-
Dracarys- Goes without saying, near perfect and actually better than the books. Having Emelia Clark lay into Kraznez for being an idiot and playing on the language thing is far more satisfying than it has a right to be (my Dad actually burst out laughing when he got incinerated). This is probably the most badass Emelia Clarke has ever sounded and very convincingly so; which at times she didn't quite manage I felt. Add to that the symbolism of the speech and the whip being trod underfoot with the music and you have a simply epic conclusion to an episode. I do have misgivings about what they cut to get to this moment by episode 4; but the execution was stunning for that scene. Two minor deviations from the book. Dany is made a lot less bloodthirsty with an ambiguous don't kill any child than the more specific 12+ die. True we do see unarmed slavers killed but its much less dark than in the books. Another was that Jorah is not a part of this plan and is just as surprised; even that Dany could speak Valyrian. In the book she took him and her bloodriders into her confidence beforehand. When Jorah looks at her having done this feat and she walks away without acknowledging him it very much implies that she has outgrown him; leaving him looking somewhat insecure. It certainly mirrors their later issues well although I don't understand why Dany would not have told him or her bloodriders beforehand.
Beric + Hound - The guy who plays the hound actually did a good job here; normally hes a gruff near-mute giant. You really got the sense of venom at him hating his brother and he holds his ground against the brotherhood; trading insults and demanding they cut his throat. Beric also carries himself well and its quite funny when he says that he will challenge him in personal combat. It manages to balance exposition with character as well as filling in the blanks for people who forgot who the brotherhood were; so I really like it for that.
Crasters Keep- Yeah, the shit really hit the fan and all the tension exploded. Jeor being stabbed in the back was terrible and now it looks like its all on Sam. It really leaves you feeling a sense of dread for how the Nights Watch can hold the wall; not that their odds were high to begin with.

The rudeness was all the sarcastic shit you threw in before making the same point. That's not being sensitive - you were rude, period. Again, you were not clear in the fact that you were saying that he didn't need to be there for the wedding but would be there afterward. Hence asking for clarification. Far safer than making an assumption. It's not like I accused you of saying that Oberyn will be eliminated from the show.

It was a jarring contrast to the aesthetic of every other episode up to this point.  That could have been a good thing, but it was a fail from my perspective.The Unsullied are very clearly directly inspired from the Spartans. The story of the 3000 Unsullied holding off against unstoppable odds immediatly puts to mind the 300 at Thermopolyae. Its Martins quite blunt way of saying "yes, they're Spartans and they're that good.". Theres also the fact that their weapons and tactics are hoplite phalanxs and their intensive training and brutal regime clearly mirrors the Spartan training. The only difference is that these are slaves and not freemen like the Spartans. So its perfectly acceptable that the Unsullied should conjur up images of the Spartans from 300 with their discipline, weapons and tactics; plus general ascetic. Which in keeping with the books as Martin is pretty clear that Unsullied=Castrated Slave Spartans.I don't know whether you mean because Essos is too Oriental for hoplites to show up, but you should remember this is a fantasy land where not every culture is exactly like its real world inspiration. Also, Ghiscari culture does draw a lot from Greco-Roman culture anyway; such as the fighting pits mirroring the colliseum. You'll also notice the nobles wearing toga like garments.
887	Maester Ruin	2013-04-22	The mutiny at Crasters always bugged me since i first read it in the book. Seriously, why would Mormont be so protective of Craster? he is a twisted wildling who starves Mormonts men to death while constantly trying his patience. i dont buy the "We need men like Craster" BS. if they needed his keep they could just set up a garrison from the NW to guard it and feed the pigs.
888	MSUMC25	2013-04-22	It's not directly in the books no - I'd imagine GRRM had some input on this because the entire writing staff (including Martin) was very hush about Theon in this season.. I have my theories on why they added it and I'm enjoying it so far.. sadly it's going to be getting much worse for poor Alfie but he seemed really excited to be able to act out these scenes from his interviews.Oh and as this is the book spoilers thread I guess it's no secret as to "who saved Theon".. I don't want to spoil it for you but it's obviously someone you do not want to call "bastard" lest you want an arrow down your freakin gullet /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />I agreeEpisode 9 is named "Rains of Castamere" I'd put my life savings down the Red Wedding happens in episode 9
889	MSUMC25	2013-04-22	I agree, jons nissa[/i]...Well after his true father gave him away, disowned him when he came back, and then left him for dead at Winterfell.  I'll take the man who raised me even if he had to be cold out of necessity over the former any day.  Ned Stark was really the only father he did have.
890	Jon-Michael Pearson	2013-04-22	Tyrion and Sasha are they going to get married in the Show?
891	WillWork4NinjaPowers	2013-04-22	where do you guys get that Brienne is feminine in the books? She isn't, at all. She has manners and a good upbringing, but she is not a lady.
892	A Bear covered in Fluff	2013-04-22	/lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' /> I'll never understand the amount of sheer rage that unremarkable Ros generates. Is it just because she's not in the books or what?It's cause she's a mary sue.

893	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-22	It's possible Oberyn doesn't appear until after the wedding. However, he needs to be in a few episodes before the duel so we can actually care about him. The scene would lose a lot if it's a guy we've barely seen trading blows with the Mountain. Bronn was pretty much established with his Egan duel, as before he was just a competent sellsword, but that's more like a badass introduction. Oberyn ain't got that option.
894	Ramsay Gimp	2013-04-22	The mutiny at Crasters always bugged me since i first read it in the book. Seriously, why would Mormont be so protective of Craster? he is a twisted wildling who starves Mormonts men to death while constantly trying his patience. i dont buy the "We need men like Craster" BS. if they needed his keep they could just set up a garrison from the NW to guard it and feed the pigs.Because allies beyond the Wall are useful. The NW doesn't have a responsibility to Craster's wives/daughters, only to the "realm" South of the Wall. And violating Guest Right is taboo no matter how shitty your host is
895	Maester Ruin	2013-04-22	Im surprised so few have mentioned this, but i was amazed by how many bones they threw us book fanatics in the sept of baelor scene, in terms of references to the Lore. I never even dreamed of hearing Aerion Brightflames name mentioned on the show!

897	Maester Ruin	2013-04-22	sorry for the double post, but i do think Berics reveal was a bit clumsy. they built up his introduction as if he was a character that the audience would recognize and instantly go like "SHIT GOT REAL", when the non book readers has no idea who he is.
i was watching it with a friend who was like "wait, am i supposed to recognize this guy? i sure dont remember seeing him before"
898	Dove	2013-04-22	Just curious, did the "Previously on..." segment include that clip from S1 where Ned sends Beric on his mission? I skipped it this time around. I know they included Selmy's dismissal for the S3 premiere, but I could see them skipping Beric's intro since he's being played by another dude altogether.
899	polarbear	2013-04-22	It's cause she's a mary sue.Ros is a mary sue? That doesnt make sense. Are you suggesting that ever since Benioff and Weiss first read AGoT, they have fantasized about being medieval hookers?You do know what a 'mary sue ' is , dont you?
900	Fragile Bird	2013-04-22	I'm pretty disappointed that it appears that Willas doesn't exist.  I wondered when in last week's scene, where Loras escorts Sansa to meet with the QoT, the conversation between Loras and Sansa was cordial to the end, instead of ending in frosty silence and Loras ditching Sansa as quickly as possible.
And what happened to D&D and the fact they made Loras unequivocally gay?  Or are we going to see a future scene with Littlefinger explaining the facts of life to Sansa?
Mostly I'm upset with all of the time some of us devoted speculating about the mysterious Willas, and the fact he could end up being revealled as the true power behind the Tyrells.  Seems D&D know something we don't know (so what else is new).
901	buff daddy	2013-04-23	Ros is a mary sue? That doesnt make sense. Are you suggesting that ever since Benioff and Weiss first read AGoT, they have fantasized about being medieval hookers?You do know what a 'mary sue ' is , dont you?She goes from being a peasant hooker way up in the unsophisticated North(whose top ruler couldn't even handle the  Byzantine politics and scheming of the South),  to running the biggest whorehouse in the biggest city in Southern Westeros.She is also recruited by the Spymaster of the kingdom to spy on one of the most cunning and dangerous players of the Game of Thrones. Not only is she successful at this, she  makes Littlefinger look like a fool and discovers what is one of his biggest plots(taking Sansa), which arguably makes her smarter than anyone in the books, because nobody caught on to this scheme of Littlefinger's in them.If she keeps going at this rate, she'll be the first person in Westeros to discover Jon Snow's true parentage.

Seems D&D know something we don't know (so what else is new).TBH I much, much prefer the idea of the family being more-or-less lead by strong, savvy, cunning women like QoT and Margaery behind the scenes than some kind of secret Willas conspiracy. That's one of the coolest, most defining traits of the Tyrells.
903	Lucifer Lightbringer	2013-04-23	What is Varys up to?The show makes it look like he suggested the Sansa/Loras match.  Wouldn't a Tyrell-Stark alliance work against his plans?  If the Tyrells are allied with the Lannisters and the Starks, then wouldn't that make it harder for Aegon to conquer?Unless he knows that the Lannisters will find out about the Tyrell plans and marry Sansa to Tyrion instead, which would somehow benefit Aegon. That is some next level shit right there if true.Edit: Nevermind, there's already a thread on this in this forum.I think it's impossible to tell without hindsight. Anything that could possibly cause tension between or harm any of the usurpers would help his cause, which is a pretty broad motivation.86th IBCT eh?
904	runeghost	2013-04-23	The farther we get into this season, the more I think both the Red and Purple weddings are going to happen this year.I just can't see how, without horribly shorting the PW buildup. Among many other things, we need to be introduced the Red Viper several episodes before the PW happens, or there's no room for Red Viper - Tyrion conversation outside of a jail cell. I won't be surprised if it happens well before episode 9 next season, but I really, really doubt we'll see it this season.
905	MoA«t	2013-04-23	I loved this episode!Jamie and Brienne get better and better. When he reached for his sword with his handless arm. Heartbreaking! I don't understand how people are bothered by her "bloody woman" comment. What she says about her own sex is true. She doesn't like what mold/stereotype Westerosi society has forced on to women, but to ignore it or pretend it doesn't exist, would take away every last female character's arch in  all of ASOIAF since every one of them pretty much defies and fights against it.Varys and the Mail Order Mage was awesome. Tyrion's face as he looks at the holes in the side of the crate......Loved the two levels of Sam this ep: 1. What's his name? Keeps trying, even if he's causing Gilly pain. Then 2. WE HAVE TO GO NOW.Bran's dream - Did anyone else notice how Cat's face got paler, and more grey as the scene went on? And "Promise me!" BRILLIANT!!I LOVE ROS. So she can read. So? There's a million reasons she can read. She wasn't a free-lance whore in Winterfell, she worked at THE BROTHEL just outside the gates. She probably helped the Madame run it, and she taught her. Maester Luwin taught her. Littlefinger hired someone to teach her. No one runs a brothel who can't read, and do math. Finding excuses to hate on Ros is getting so tiresome. Finding excuses to hate on any deviation from the books is exhausting. I don't know how some of you do it.I love Ros with Varys. Of course, any excuse for more Varys is awesome win.I LOVE COCKMASTER POD, no one can figure out why, and everyone wants to know. One of the funniest bits ever. Love it. Hope it goes on forever. "Don't speak..."OMG. jack Gleeson, I shall miss you so much. Please don't stop acting. It's hard to fathom that he can make Joffrey even more loathsome, and pitiful than in the books. I honestly feel bad for him. You see his fear of the crowd. You see him want to be loved, and accepted like Margaery. And yet there's still that horrible glee and plesure he gets from the death and pain of others. So creepy. So epic.Natalie Dormer rocks. Love what they're giving her to do..... The Smiling Black Widow of Westeros.The Sept - what a gorgeous set!Love Dame Rigg and anyone she shares a scene with!Theon made me cry with his, "My real father" comment, Alfie just gets better and better. And Ramsey is going to out-creep Joffrey.Tywin. HFS. "I will."Love the look of hope on Sansa's face at not only the prospect of having a friend, of having that friend be The Queen, but also allowing herself to imagine, even for a moment, the possibility of actually marrying her SuperCrush. That heartbreak will be epic.I will miss the Old Bear so much. Gods that scene was awesome. And I want to stab Rast myself.Beric was awesome.Dany. Emilia was MASTERFUL. The entire scene rocked from start to finish.Holy shit that was awesome, and it was only episode 4.
906	MarieAntoinette	2013-04-23	I really liked this episode. Above everything else I loved Dany and the interaction between Varys and the Queen of Thornes. I think show Margaery is much more interesting than her book counterpart, Natalie Dormer is great.  Based on Bran's dream I think that Michelle will make an awesome Lady Stoneheart, I'm looking forward to that.
907	A Bear covered in Fluff	2013-04-23	Am curious In what way do you find her more "realistic"? She's a prostitute that can read and write (that should start cluing you in about the realism aspect. How many smallfolk in a medieval setting actually had this skill?) and now she's ascended to hand of the pimp, to borrow another poster description of her job. How many powerful men go about the city with a prostitute as executive assistant in Westeros?Actually, she's the madame of the house now. That position is actually a quite established title in medieval times. ( would know, larpd it)
908	Peptalk	2013-04-23	Oh and also loved that Cat grew paler and paler in Bran's dream. Such a great touch of foreshadowing if non-reader viewers are attentive. And Conleth Hill is perfect as Varys. I loved how they established how dangerous he actually is through the scene with Tyrion. He's not as innocent as one might think and this certainly adds to his mystique.
They are definitely picking up the pace this season, with every character on the show. I really like that the characters on the sidelines are getting bigger roles, they are just as important as the lead characters; they make the game what it is and affect the outcome so much more than one would think at a first glance.

909	WatcherontheRock	2013-04-23	Agreed. The question is how far into season 4 will they do the purple wedding? My bet is they'll pad out the first half of the season somewhat, do the purple wedding around episode 6/7 so Tyrion's trial and eventual escape leads us to the privy scene in episode 9? I may be wrong; what does everyone else think?I personnaly think it will happen earlier. Season 4 will not only be the second half of ASOS. They will begin to dig into AFFC and ADWD. I would place it at the exact middle of the season. Tyrion arc's end will certainly be the privy scene, episode 9, or even 10 (I want Tywin to die as late as possible). But I don"t think this will be the high point of the season (it is in the books, but not in the sense of the RW. The death of Tywin unleashes further chaos in the realm, but no one realises it immediately). This my great question for season 4 : what will be the great moment, after Ned's beheading, Blackwater, and obviously the RW ? I really don't know.
910	WatcherontheRock	2013-04-23	For the episode in itself, that was close to perfection. I won't repeat what so many of you already said. 
1- For locations : the sept is awesome, and I haven't noticed, but in the opening credits, the Twins are already here, when they go from Riverrun to Winterfell. Interesting.
2- For images : the atmosphere in Craster's Keep was just fantastic. The lights and of course the actions were the perfect match.
3- For Varys : I love him. But his scene with the sorcerer felt a bit odd. Varys does nothing without purpose, and he certainly doesn't reveal his personnal life. So was it a way to show the bond between Varys and Tyrion, and prepare the privy scene, and even something more only GRRM and D&D know? I hope so. His meeting with Olenna was great, and his interaction with LF always fascinating. By the way, I do not predict a long life for Ros. LF hates those who try to play with him (except Varys). 
4- "I don't distrust you because you're a woman. I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are". Well Tywin, you distrust her because you don't have to trust her. You are the boss, a boss doesn't trust. Love the way he said "All right. Contribute" (subtext : speak your part and let me write my letter to my old friend Walder Frey alone). Tywin's scenes are very well constructed, and now we know that Cersei and Tyrion are on the same level with him, which is a very low one. And of course, who can't wait to see Tywin finally meet his grandson? Joffrey needs a sharp lesson.
5- I was, for the second time of the show, impressed by Brienne, but this time, in an emotional way. "You're a bloody woman". That line is fantastic, and the way she treats Jaime is great. She's really a great character, and Christie a great actress. 
6- We finally meet Ramsay. Great scene, with the look in the end (reminded me of Frodo in Mount Doom). Smart move besides from D&D : Joffrey will progressively fade, until he chokes, and by the time we'll have his replacement. And Ramsay is a deal madder than Joffrey.
7- The last branch of the seven pointed star : Daenerys of course. Absolutely brilliant. There is nothing to drop. Dracarys of course, and the Unsullied. But the looks, his speech in Valyrian, the look of amazement/relish/delight on Mormont's and Selmy's face. And the very final shot. Even the music was great. 
In the top 5 of all the series. Only two less good scenes : Bran, too short, it just felt they wanted us to remind he existed. Arya. The scene was good, but I don't think they fully succeeded in the introduction of Beric. But I'm sure the trial of next week will erase this hesitation.
And I've seen episode 5 preview. We'll finally really meet Roose. I expect a lot of this scene. "Bolton's silence was a hundred times more threatening than [Locke]'s slobbering malevolence"
911	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-23	Vogarro's whore was a whore too. Didnt stop her from building a significant enterprise.Did you read the rest of my post or some of my other posts? You missed my point.When I said that Ros is a whore, I wasn't saying that she is stupid, incompetent or incapable of anything. What I meant is that she doesn't necessarily HAVE to know how to read (unlike Geisha). Whether you think she is realistic or unrealistic, love her or hate her, you have to admit that she IS ambitious. I believe that Ros is ambitious otherwise, she wouldn't even have moved to KL. I don't think Ros is stupid or that she had problems running the brothel without knowing how to read. Like I said in the rest of my post, just because a person doesn't know how to read, it doesn't mean that he/she is stupid, and you don't need to learn how to read to learn how to count.The fact that Ros can read is just a little bit ...odd, and came a little bit ... off because it was never established. However, since she is ambitious, she could have learned. I never said that it was impossible for Ros to learn how to read. Maybe Pycelle taught her for her services, or maybe the other girls in the brothel taught her, or maybe some other client taught her, either way who knows?My problem was with some explanations that some people were giving. For example, someone said that maybe her father taught her. I don't believe this explanation. Since Ros became a whore, I will assume that her father was a common peasant. Normal peasants don't usually know how to read, hence he wouldn't have been able to teach her.Many people where saying that maybe Lord Baelish taught her. I strongly disagree with this. Chataya cared about her girls. But we've seen that LF doesn't give a shit about his whores. I think that he wouldn't want them to waste time learning to read when they should be learning to how please the clients and making more money. Besides, LF seems to have his office in the brothel. Why would he want the whores to learn how to read and be able to read his notes with his plans and plots, and then go babbling around telling his plans to everyone? And I don't believe that Petyr would be so stupid as to trust his plans with his whores, but then Show!LF is a complete idiot compared with Book!LF.

Theon told Ramsay about the boys being alive !!!!That is a massive change from the books.Why is it a massive change? In the books Ramsay as Reek was the one who gave Theon the idea of killing the other kids. In the books the Boltons know that Bran and Rickon are alive.

915	PatrickStormborn	2013-04-23	where do you guys get that Brienne is feminine in the books? She isn't, at all. She has manners and a good upbringing, but she is not a lady. She has a very feminine personality.
916	Joyful Union	2013-04-23	She has a very feminine personality.What is a feminine personality? I thought the very idea of preconceived notions of femininity was considered offensive?
917	Gran de Lys	2013-04-23	The best thing about this episode was no Talisa with the four-way hips.
918	Syphon the Sanitator	2013-04-23	I always hated Theon in the books, but that one simple sentence he spoke in the show made me think that maybe what he went through in the Dreadfort wasn't what he deserved.
919	FacelessSnow	2013-04-23	She goes from being a peasant hooker way up in the unsophisticated North(whose top ruler couldn't even handle the  Byzantine politics and scheming of the South),  to running the biggest whorehouse in the biggest city in Southern Westeros.She is also recruited by the Spymaster of the kingdom to spy on one of the most cunning and dangerous players of the Game of Thrones. Not only is she successful at this, she  makes Littlefinger look like a fool and discovers what is one of his biggest plots(taking Sansa), which arguably makes her smarter than anyone in the books, because nobody caught on to this scheme of Littlefinger's in them.If she keeps going at this rate, she'll be the first person in Westeros to discover Jon Snow's true parentage.lol, interesting theory I kind of like it.  But more importantly, this is an important deviation from the books, so since Varys, QoT, and Ros all know about LF plan and thus where Sansa disappears to, doesn't this complicate things in the future?  Or is everyone just not gonna care that Sansa just disappears after PW?  I guess QoT won't mind and may actually work with LF to make it happen since Sansa runs away with the evidence, but Varys?? Plots on top of Plots at KL.  I also think this serves as proof that Ros will go the way of Dontos via LF knowing she was a double agent all along (one can hope).
920	LastDragonLives	2013-04-23	One of the best episodes so far. Excellent.Let's start with the obvious - the Astapor scene was perfect. After a while, I really liked Emilia Clarke's acting. She is a beautiful women, no doubt, but somehow - after season one -   she didn't really persuade me that she IS Daenerys, the mother of dragons, the queen, the person who is natural born leader. Up to now. But now, she really sounded right - i hope she will continue to act so. Whole scene was near to perfection, I think, with that music...Phenomenal.The character of Daenarys does not become a leader until around this time, at least not as confident.  This is a thread for those who have read the books, so I hope I am not spoiling this for you, but she is not nearly as confident in herself as they portray until now.  And sorry to say it, by the time we reach ADWD in my opinion, she turns into a whiny mess.  This was one of my problems with the book.  But I think GRRM wanted to remind us that even though she is the Queen of Dragons, she still is a young woman with vulnearbilities and weaknesses.  Again, didn't anybody want to see more of the sacking of Astapor???  There hasn't been nearly enough action.  It was a cool scene but all we saw was 2 slavers killed, the Slavemaster burned, and then a wave of fire behind Dany's head.  I would have liked to see a little more gore and destruction from the wrath of the dragons unleashed on Astapor.
921	Khal Porno	2013-04-23	What is a feminine personality? I thought the very idea of preconceived notions of femininity was considered offensive?ZING!I also don't think she has a "feminine" personality, whatever that means.
922	Jazzman	2013-04-23	Did Catelyn in Brans dream make everyone else think of Lady Stoneheart?Yeah it really got me thinkin about Lady Stoneheart! I Almost think i saw her wear a scarf in Brans dream, or maybe i just imagined!
923	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-23	True I forgot about this haha Nice one !No problem man /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />Yeah it really got me thinkin about Lady Stoneheart! I Almost think i saw her wear a scarf in Brans dream, or maybe i just imagined!YES! that was very......creepy. And you're right she was wearing a scarf! YES! Lady Stoneheart! I guess we'll see her at the end of the season, right?
924	JMJ	2013-04-23	I always hated Theon in the books, but that one simple sentence he spoke in the show made me think that maybe what he went through in the Dreadfort wasn't what he deserved.Theon, both in the books and in the show, is pure tragedy to me. A guy who is taken as a boy as ward to a family your family hates, grows to admire, if not love his ward family. He is then conflicted about his family loyalties, which costs him dearly in the end. I am fully expecting a massive redemption story with Theon in TWOW (or beyond).

926	brandino	2013-04-23	I hated Theon in the second book.  However, once they introduce him as reek and you find out what all happened to him you just feel really sorry for him.  In many ways, his is a fate worse than death.

When that didn't happen, he was understandably desperate to earn their acceptance. This led him to make terrible decisions that still failed to earn the Greyjoys' respect and support. Now he has had time to reflect on the values and ethics of the Greyjoys vs. the Starks and begin to rethink. I dislike Theon's character intensely and think he deserves harsh punishment, but no one deserves to be tortured by a sadist like Ramsay. OMG. As brandino said, it truly is a fate worse than death. An upcoming redemption storyline by GRRM would be an awesome conclusion.

Most of them have been incredibly done and obviously they don't want the show to be exactly the same as the books, but I feel like they're taking a lot of the mystery out of characters like Littlefinger, Varys and Olenna, who we still don't know a lot about at the end of the fifth book

I would have liked to see a little more gore and destruction from the wrath of the dragons unleashed on Astapor.Don't worry, I'v read the books, so you are not spoiling anything /cheers.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cheers:' />I have a slightly different opinion on Daenerys, though. I think she was a frightened little girl at the first book, but after that, she did become a leader. I think there are two main reasons why she appears like a "whiny mess" from time to time, especially later in the books :1)She is new in that queen/leader business - she doesn't know what to do, where to go, how to make all those people (liberated slaves) safe, etc. So, she is a bit lost in all of that.2)We can see her thoughts.That's the main reason, if you ask me. We can see how insecure she is, how tired, and so on. We don't get to see that when un - POV characters are concerned , like Tywin, for example. He looks firm as a rock, in any moment. But, if we got to see his thoughts, who the hell knows how would that look like. Maybe he feels overwhelmed with the situation from time to time as well. Maybe he lusts for Shae /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' /> /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' /> . We will never find out, all we know is that he looks like a boss in any situation.Good example for this is Melissandre. Seen through eyes of others, she looks like a confidence itself; But her POV chapter shows us that she is also insecure. So, in short : Without POV status, Daenerys would seem as a proper Dragon queen, not as a whiner. That's my impression.Anyway, my remark to Emilia Clarke was that she failed to show us how charismatic and confident Daenerys could be, when she isn't whining. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' /> . Like she doesn't know how to be relaxed, but authoritative at the same time . Charles Dance knows /smug.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':smug:' /> But she is improving, I think.And, yes it would be better that an Astapor scene was a proper Blood - bath, but I think budget reasons prevent that ( a massive fight and so on).I want to apologize for a long post, especially to "LastDragonLives" who, most probably will try to read it to the end.Sorry /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> And of course, for any mistakes.

When they are done right, of course. And the book versions remain mysterious since they are different.
933	StephenOfCloverfield	2013-04-23	Ok not read all the thread but on Ros being smarter than Vary: is it possible he was pretending not to see what she was getting at to make her feel smart? He is manipulating her after all.
934	Maxthestig	2013-04-23	I think this weeks episode is much better on a second watch. I gave it an 8 after watching it for the first time but i Would say nearer 9.5 after a second watch.Here is our review, would be great to get your opinion on our review. Just check out video out !http://www.youtube.c...h?v=5sM_aXw2GeUThe Theon scene put a lump in my throat, I felt sorry for him after season 2. And now my heart goes out to him......The Varys scene was unbelievable as well. It's not in the books but its a welcome addition for me!Plus the Tywin scene where he tells Cersei that she isn't as clever as she thinks. Great too !!!!!!!!!!!!
935	StephenOfCloverfield	2013-04-23	Again, I haven't yet read the whole thread but, NO WAY Tywin is in on purple wedding. That scene was just him saying Cersei you can't control him but I will. Remember this is Twin Lannister, people do what he says!
936	StephenOfCloverfield	2013-04-23	Um, no.  Ros is awful and a plot device for flat-out lazy writing.  She is completely unrealistic for a woman of "those times" and her whole double-agent role is ludicrous.  Her "moving up in the world" as Littlefinger's Hand of the Pimp makes no sense.Hand of the Pimp!Awesome phrasing!
937	Lyana	2013-04-23	Well, that was a great episode. I only voted 9, cause I know the show can do even better in the next episodes and it probably would. The final scenes were epic. I finally get that feeling that I am watching a big production with a decent budget. The Blackwater episode was impressive, but the "Dracarys" scene was really something I was looking for. I def got goosebumps.
The episode had definitely a strong and emotional beginning. Seeing Jaime defeated and desperate was a call back to reality. He realizes he cannot always count on his father's name. And here enters Brienne an returns him the favor, trying to make him angry and wake the will to live in him. It was emotional scene - sad, but somehow beautiful - representing perfectly the dynamic between the two characters.
I was wondering the whole time what was Varys actually doing with the box, while talking to Tyrion. I knew he was up to something but wasn't expecting ... that. I guess there isn't any special meaning behind this deviation from the book story. It was just supposed to give the viewers the feeling that Varys is a dangerous guy indeed and he can wait as long as it takes to achieve his purposes. And from the looks if Tyrion I would say he was rather impressed too.
The tension at the NW has started to build up slowly since the previous episode. We see the minor gestures and statements which lead us to thing this apple has rotten from the inside long time ago. Of course in the book the hunger and desperation were almost real. But the show did its best too. Hunger and fear do make people go crazy. The Nights Watch has fallen - not at the Wall, but there in Craster's Keep. And so did Mormont - his watch has ended.
I know that there are so many characters this season, but Bran's story line seems really unimportant and somehow distant. We get to see him for a minute pro episode and people are still confused about the Reeds. It is somehow sad, because I have the feeling he has the most important role to play later. The dream of Catelyn was some kind of foreshadowing I guess. We all know what's coming.
The Sansa plot is more obvious than in the books and I find that understandable. I really enjoyed the Varys quality time in this episode. He is the best. I can't recall one thing though - why was Ross so willing to spy for him?
Margaery is the new sweetheart. I love her interaction with Joffrey and Jack Gleeson is an outstanding actor - probably one of the best in the show. His fear from the common people was almost surreal and than the insecure waving to the crowd ... He nailed it. The Sept of Baelor was impressive. Also we learned some brief history lessons and got to see Cersei truly worried - priceless.
Poor Theon. His confession about Ned Stark was heartbreaking. Theon's story is somehow really tragic, but also showing how one's life could be truly affected from early stages. My non-book reader friends still don't feel pity for him, but I guess it would all come later.
Aaaaand finally Cersei got her a*s spanked. She deserved it. And from her father's mouth. It was really impressive to see how Tiwyn holds his children - only with one word, gesture or look. He does not have power - he IS the power. And the thin irony was also spot on - he is criticizing Cersei about not being able to handle her own son, but yet he failed tremendously in the proper upbringing of his own children. And only the sound of the letter writing just got me chills.
The Olenna scenes are really refreshing. I was surprised to see how Varys was not prepared for her honesty at the beginning of the conversation but he then soon got his confidence back. Those were some really good lines. I was really enjoying the scene. And than the related one with Sansa and Margaery was also fine. They are so different but still willing to be friends - two beautiful little girls in the middle of the cruel Game of Thrones. Was it said explicitly in the show that Loras is in the Kings Guard? Cause that makes the marriage proposal without any real meaning. Sansa wouldn't have fallen for that. Otherwise the slightly change was ok. We don't need another new character to remember.
We won't be seeing enough of Arya this season I guess but I'm looking forward to hear some prophecies. I'm not sure if they will include the Ghost of High Heart, or they will just make Thoros to see something in the flames though.
As I have already stated, the final scene was epic. The minor complaint was just that we really didn't think Dany would actually sell Drogon. Some more suspense couldn't have hurt but it's fine. Also I hope we get to see more consistent appearances by each character. Not one scene pro episode.
Edited: spelling

We don't need another new character to remember.Perhaps I took this up wrong, but is Margaery not completely playing Sansa at this point?Olenna and Varys have just spoken of how Sansa could be the key to the North, and neither want Littlefinger to possess this key.Next thing, Margaery is proposing Sansa instead goes to Highgarden, giving Loras and the Tyrells the prospect of Northern control.Margaery is not 'caught up' in the Game of Thrones, she's playing it, and very well, under the guidance and protection of her grandmother.Sansa, in contrast, is STILL so naive, innocent and, in truth, cringeworthy at this stage. A pawn in the game.
939	MoA«t	2013-04-23	And you're right she was wearing a scarf! YES! Lady Stoneheart! I guess we'll see her at the end of the season, right?No. She wasn't wearing a scarf. I noticed she got paler and more grey as the scene went on, so I rewound, and watched it over and over to make sure I wasn't seeing things, and to see if they had done anything to her neck (which they hadn't.) She has her regular Winterfell-ish dress/neckline on.
940	Dove	2013-04-23	Between the grayish tinge to her skin and the "Promise me" line it felt like two different references & a definite shout-out to people in the know, in addition to being your pretty standard "~~mysterious Bran dream~~" but I could be reading too much into it.

Her skin changes color, along with her demeanor. She's almost smiling in the first shot with slight color in her face, then grows grayer, and more aggro as the scene progresses, borderline feral. The color change was done in post, and is very subtle, but it's there, and it's bloody brilliant.

942	lil_z	2013-04-23	I'm left curious why Vars scene was added. They certainly like to forshadow in obvious ways. I don't remember if Vars ever reveals this story to Tyrion in the books its been a while since I read them. I understand that they may be trying to give him clearer motivations, were in the books his purpose and motivations are left to much speculation to not only the characters but to the reader as well. His intentions and involvement in nefarious deeds are always in question.
I'm also kind of disappointed that LF's plan isn't left a mystery until he spirits Sansa away through the offish knight (I forget the nickname used Sir Florin I think). I loved the scene were Sansa and the reader learns just how cunning and vicious LF really is.
I'm curious to see how Jorah is revealed as the spy to King Robert now that Barristan was revealed so soon.
I'm still hurt over not introducing strong belwas, now who will kill the champion of Yankai?
943	jmk51	2013-04-23	It's not impossible that one whore  could read,  nor is it odd that Varys didn't see the two beds on the bill of lading.  He's not Sherlock Holmes, he's a schemer. 
The odd thing to me was that Ros saw 2 beds and she deduced it was a plot to whisk away Sansa.  Makes me think this is a LF scheme.
944	wolverine	2013-04-23	Is anybody else slightly concerned with how many new scenes have been added in? Most of them have been incredibly done and obviously they don't want the show to be exactly the same as the books, but I feel like they're taking a lot of the mystery out of characters like Littlefinger, Varys and Olenna, who we still don't know a lot about at the end of the fifth bookYou may be right about them taking some of the mystery out of those three.  But maybe not everything is as it appears on the show?So far it looks like Margaery is making all nice with her king.  I don't think watchers could expect the Purple Wedding at all.
945	Dragon Doll	2013-04-23	You may be right about them taking some of the mystery out of those three.  But maybe not everything is as it appears on the show?So far it looks like Margaery is making all nice with her king.  I don't think watchers could expect the Purple Wedding at all.I agree, yet disagree. I feel as if they're giving the 'unsullied' the perfect amount of clues without spoiling the twists. And i feel that all of Margaery's actions fit perfectly with my impression of her character. (strong, manipulative...)
946	ferreyra anderson	2013-04-24	Thought that was a given.ep 9 - Red Weddingep 10 - Purple wedding.Season closes with Tyrion being accused and restrained.That would be soo awesome... plus Sansa escaping...
947	DarkLordVerjal	2013-04-24	Jeez, every episode that passes it makes it more and more difficult to wait a week. This week's staggeringly good episode is no exception, and now I feel the need to join in on the conversation a bit.
I loved Jaime from the first ep I saw him in, since I haven't read the books(yet), his whole story was new to me. Despite him seemingly being a completely terrible person. Certain people see different things, and I saw a generally decent man with his own moral code. But his family were exceptions to his code, and most people in the world feel the same way. And being a glutton for spoilers, I couldn't help but read wiki on him and synopsis on the books; dropping me smack dab in this spiffy forum.
Wiki is only so detailed though, so I was wondering if him and Brienne fall in love, and whether or not he regains his infamous skill with a blade?
948	Kenyatta	2013-04-24	Definitely not the only one.IT MAKES NO SENSE FOR IT TO HAPPEN BEFORE THE RED VIPER IS INTRODUCED.Exactly. Where are the Dornish? Where is Oberyn Martell? That's what I've been waiting for. The "purple" wedding can't happen before Tyrion/Sansa Wedding and if that's the case you're talking about three weddings in six weeks. Not gonna happen.ETA: Upon further review, here's what I think will happen. D&D are going to Godfather style and juxtapose RW with Tyrion/Sansa Wedding. Balon is pretty much an afterthought at this point. Maybe a cut scene with him falling off the bridge or something since he's not Theon's "real father" anyway. Then in the final scene you have Mellisandre coming back to Stannis and telling him "It is done my lord. Oh and by the way, I've had the best sex that I ever had with a real man who didn't go all limp on me before he climaxed....you're welcome."

949	Kenyatta	2013-04-24	When is Sam the Slayer going to happen? It has to be in front of the NW, or it doesn't have the same impact. This is really frustrating me.Same here. I thought the Slayer scene happened before Craster's Keep?
950	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2013-04-24	Mutiny at Crasters! Mutiny in Astapor! best episode so far, by far!
951	Khal Pono	2013-04-24	Emilia Carke was SO EFFING GOOD in this episode.  As a huge fan of Emilia's I felt somewhat vindicated against her detractors that whine that she's a "bad actor."  Critic Alan Sepinwall put it perfectly in his review of episode 4:That scene was also a reminder of how great Emilia Clarke can be in this role when she's given good material. I don't know that Meryl Streep could have done much with all that "Where are my dragons?" whining from last season. Here her big moment comes in a (fictional) foreign language, and the subtitles are barely necessary. That's how good she is.I echo the user who was concerned that having Sam slay the Other when none of his brothers around to see it happen would be very disappointing, but I don't think that's necessarily what will take place.  He could meet up with Grenn and Edd before they get to Castle Black.  Any number of situations/book deviations could transpire that would allow some of the watchmen to witness his "slayer" heroics.

952	Badvoc	2013-04-24	James Cosmo is a loss for the show even though I knew it had to happen eventually. /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />Totally agree with that, the man is a legend /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> oh look that's him in my avatar with me /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
953	Khal Pono	2013-04-24	Also, I think the people who are complaining that Brienne's "you sound like a bloody woman line" is sexist are misreading some of the underlying motivations.  The Brienne in the show does have enormous respect for women, as we see in the scene when she pledges herself to Catelyn as well as in the scene where she insists on burying the murdered sex workers and takes grisly revenge on one of their killers.  Yes, they've made her more ferocious and bloodthirsty than she was in the books, but she is no less awkward or naive (as we saw in the scene where she stupidly tries to appeal to Locke's sense of honor by telling him she swore an oath to Lady Catelyn, as if he cares).
Her line about Jaime sounding like a woman was pure manipulation--trying to push his sexist buttons--an effort to try to snap him out of his funk in a desperate attempt to save his life.
Brienne may have feelings of self-loathing and be embarrassed of her huge body, but she does not hate other women or think less of them.
954	Dragonstoned	2013-04-24	I'm still hurt over not introducing strong belwas, now who will kill the champion of Yankai?Barristan probs, would be cool to see him in action.

Either way, is pushing people's buttons something Brienne even does? From her POV chapters she seems too naive to manage people in that way but I might be wrong.The question should be whether D&D's line is as good as 'are you so craven?' which I don't see anyone arguing.  Instead of sexism etc. I thought they were just trying to make Brienne look 'hard' or 'badass' in her back-and-forth with Jaime, and misjudged it.

956	Sword in the Night	2013-04-24	Hi everyone, fan of the forums and first time poster. The show introduced me to the books and I've been hooked ever since. 
This episode was one of my favourites and I really liked how the pace of everything is starting to pick up more. Also been really curious as to how D&D were going to handle Theon's scenes this season since it really is sort of new territory that they're adapting but the "my real father lost his head in kings landing" line really stuck a chord. I'm still reading ADWD and really enjoying Theon's chapters but its nice to see in his in real time his moment of revelation of "oh shit, i really fucked up here"
As for Brienne's comment, I just chalked it up to the hegemonic masculinity that was the prevailing viewpoint of the times. People definitely did feel that men were superior to women, at least in terms of fighting (look at all the abuse Brienne takes for being a woman), so Brienne probably thought it was the best thing to say to get Jaime back on track. Its easy to see it as sexism now, but I don't think it was meant to be construed that way.
Also, Dracarys!!!!! /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />
957	Daske	2013-04-24	I've heard plenty of women say to men things like 'you big girl!' (or 'you big girl's blouse!') or 'you run like a girl'. It's usually heavily laced with irony and directed at a particularly sexist or macho man who is being particularly crap at that moment. Which does fit with the Brienne scene somewhat. It's all about the irony, context, and who is saying it.

958	The Monkey	2013-04-24	I wish we'd get at least some scene where Sansa reacts to Bran and Rickon's supposed death. Notwithstanding that the scene would be a nice emotional piece in and of itself, it's important that it's made clear that this turn of events is known in KL, because that's what makes Sansa Robb's heir, and all the more important as a marriage prize.
959	Khal Porno	2013-04-24	My girlfriend says stuff like that to me all the time.  Including the "you sound like a woman" thing when she thinks I'm being dramatic about something, exactly the situation between Jaime and Brienne.  She doesn't do it because she hates women and hates herself. 
This whole argument is silly, and people grasping for whatever criticisms they can level at the show because they don't like that some things are different from the books.
960	LastDragonLives	2013-04-24	Exactly. Where are the Dornish? Where is Oberyn Martell? That's what I've been waiting for. The "purple" wedding can't happen before Tyrion/Sansa Wedding and if that's the case you're talking about three weddings in six weeks. Not gonna happen.ETA: Upon further review, here's what I think will happen. D&D are going to Godfather style and juxtapose RW with Tyrion/Sansa Wedding. Balon is pretty much an afterthought at this point. Maybe a cut scene with him falling off the bridge or something since he's not Theon's "real father" anyway. Then in the final scene you have Mellisandre coming back to Stannis and telling him "It is done my lord. Oh and by the way, I've had the best sex that I ever had with a real man who didn't go all limp on me before he climaxed....you're welcome."They have already said that this season is only the 1st half of Book 3!  Therefore, there will be no Purple Wedding.  Most likely the season will end before Tyrion and Sansa marry as well.  The Red Wedding will be close to if not the end of the season.  I think GRRM said he would have to hide from the internet after an episode this season and we all know what that means.
961	LastDragonLives	2013-04-24	Episode 9 is named "Rains of Castamere" I'd put my life savings down the Red Wedding happens in episode 9Without a doubt.  And then episode 10 will be the last of the season, leading into season 4 where we have to wait another year to see Joffery's creepy face choke to death.  This is the spoilers thread people sorry if you click the wrong one and I ruin it for you.
962	LastDragonLives	2013-04-24	Don't worry, I'v read the books, so you are not spoiling anything /cheers.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cheers:' />I have a slightly different opinion on Daenerys, though. I think she was a frightened little girl at the first book, but after that, she did become a leader. I think there are two main reasons why she appears like a "whiny mess" from time to time, especially later in the books :1)She is new in that queen/leader business - she doesn't know what to do, where to go, how to make all those people (liberated slaves) safe, etc. So, she is a bit lost in all of that.2)We can see her thoughts.That's the main reason, if you ask me. We can see how insecure she is, how tired, and so on. We don't get to see that when un - POV characters are concerned , like Tywin, for example. He looks firm as a rock, in any moment. But, if we got to see his thoughts, who the hell knows how would that look like. Maybe he feels overwhelmed with the situation from time to time as well. Maybe he lusts for Shae /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' /> /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' /> . We will never find out, all we know is that he looks like a boss in any situation.Good example for this is Melissandre. Seen through eyes of others, she looks like a confidence itself; But her POV chapter shows us that she is also insecure. So, in short : Without POV status, Daenerys would seem as a proper Dragon queen, not as a whiner. That's my impression.Anyway, my remark to Emilia Clarke was that she failed to show us how charismatic and confident Daenerys could be, when she isn't whining. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' /> . Like she doesn't know how to be relaxed, but authoritative at the same time . Charles Dance knows /smug.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':smug:' /> But she is improving, I think.And, yes it would be better that an Astapor scene was a proper Blood - bath, but I think budget reasons prevent that ( a massive fight and so on).I want to apologize for a long post, especially to "LastDragonLives" who, most probably will try to read it to the end.Sorry /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />And of course, for any mistakes.I agree with you for the most part, we don't get to see her thoughts shich is a big part of it.  They have ways of doing this on TV (voices in the background etc) but they haven't done it in the show yet so I doubt they will start now.  Agreed that budget constraints probably shortened the Astapor scene, but scenes like that are what make the show.  Not long, boring Catelyn monolouges.  I can't even imagine how much it costs HBO to make the show but I'm sure they are making it back or they wouldn't have renewed them for another season.  Maybe because I read the books after seeing season 1 and 2 is why I am minorly disappointed by this season, which is understandable, but I watched Seasons 1 and 2 again after I read the books and liked them just as much.  I dunno I just feel like something is missing so far this season.  And I don't like them adding storylines and changing time frames like having Theon just show up now when he didn't come back to the story before ADWD.
963	HopeForSpring	2013-04-24	I think they have some constraints because of dealing with real people with real acting careers.
They have to give more scenes to the actors they do have and are important - like Varys, like Theon - so they can keep them around for the indefinite number of years this might take. So we end up with scenes that aren't in the book like Varys and QoT
Meanwhile actors that are seen in the first season and then not again until many seasons later - like Mago - might as well kill them of in case the actor isn't around.
I didn't like what they did to the Night Watch at all (no sam the slayer, no holding of Mormont's head...) but in general they are doing a tough job of collapsing characters really well.
964	LastDragonLives	2013-04-24	You are right the actors probably don't want to wait 3 years before coming back to the show.    Also I agree that no Sam the Slayer is weak (I think this has probably been eliminated by now, and he actually DID get off the Ravens, which they said he didn't in the first episode).
965	Joyful Union	2013-04-24	The question should be whether D&D's line is as good as 'are you so craven?' which I don't see anyone arguing.  Instead of sexism etc. I thought they were just trying to make Brienne look 'hard' or 'badass' in her back-and-forth with Jaime, and misjudged it.Actually, she did call him a coward, they just avoided using craven because it would likely confuse many people.Also, are you implying Brienne isn't badass???  /fencing.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':fencing:' />

The showrunners are getting her backwards and making her badass by having her remorselessly kill people in combat, absolutely own Jaime and insult him all the time.That's what I thought the 'coward' comment was, more of an insult than her trying to help.  It's open to interpretation but the tone was very harsh (we don't know how she said 'craven' in the books but to me it comes across as desperate and imploring and she whispers it).  It sounded just part of the 'bloody woman' insult she next came out with.
967	rmholt	2013-04-24	It's not impossible that one whore  could read,  nor is it odd that Varys didn't see the two beds on the bill of lading.  He's not Sherlock Holmes, he's a schemer.The odd thing to me was that Ros saw 2 beds and she deduced it was a plot to whisk away Sansa.  Makes me think this is a LF scheme.Much of Varys' knowledge comes from others.  Ros seems to be a special kind of little bird.
968	rmholt	2013-04-24	BTW that Sorcerer scene just freaked me out!  I loved it! It wasnt out of character for the story itself nor for Varys. MHO.  I was like WTF is Varys doing with that big crate - I didnt recall any big crates in his story line.  And he leads such an austere life - what would he need a whole crate full of?
969	Toxspecific	2013-04-24	This episode was masterful and the best dialogue of all was Theon's. So moving. Anyhow, it had those "Wow' moments that season 1 had every episode and that season 2  sometimes lacked. Good stuff. Very good episode.
970	rmholt	2013-04-24	I cant help it Missandei is just Not Right.
971	rmholt	2013-04-24	Same here. I thought the Slayer scene happened before Craster's Keep?I think it has to happen (Sam slaying the Other) I trust it will be satisfactorily presented.  I had no complaints with the way the wights marched on the Fist even though it was totally not by the book.  And Sam could not have sent off the ravens given his situation in that last scene.  Otherwise we would all be asking how the heck he beat the wights back to the Fist.  It was Mormont who sent him out to shovel sh*t to begin with so apparently that wasnt his ONLY job.  Mormont is being a little harsh.
972	rmholt	2013-04-24	Brienne thinks of women the way Arya thinks of "stupid girls"  BTW her speech was magnificent - about Jaime whining about the loss of his hand as if he were the only person to ever lose his or her purpose in life.  I kept expecting her to go all Dr Phil and tell him to rub some dirt on it.

976	Dove	2013-04-24	If they keep in that gratuitous Dany + Irri scene except with her it's going to be all kinds of awkward. On one hand she's absolutely gorgeous, on the other... aging up a character primarily to give her sex scenes? A little odd.

983	Jon Icefyre	2013-04-24	Ros telling VArys about the feather beds that Little finger has for his travels is bothering me because I suspect there's going to be some big story changes in that arc.I think she might actually be playing Varys and that's how Littlefinger will find out and tell the Lannisters about the Tyrell's plans for Sansa.
984	Dragonblood Stormborn	2013-04-24	I just watched the episode again and I got goose bumps and emotional again seeing the Dracarys scene.  Her determination and confidence and power for justice chokes me up.

986	Jon Icefyre	2013-04-24	wait, but, Littlefinger colludes with The Queen of Thorns (Tyrells) to shuttle Sansa out with him.  Varys helps them, against the Lannisters.No he(Littlefinger) doesn't, Littlefinger and Olenna only worked together to poison Joffrey. In the books Olenna originally tried to marry Sansa to her grandson Willas Tyrell in order to give the Tyrells Winterfell, but Littlefinger spoils her plan my telling Tywin before she had the chance to set up the marriage.  Olenna doesn't know Littlefinger is the one who spoiled her plans, so actually she was just being played by Littlefinger.  In the TV series Olenna had no idea of Littlefinger's intention to shuffle out sansa, until Varys told her, which means Varys and Olenna are actually working against Littlefinger.  That's why right after the scene with Olenna talking to Varys about Sansa it switches to the scene where Margaery proposes to Sansa that she marry ser Loras.  Which I believe Littlefinger will counter by telling the Lannisters of the Tyrells plan.  Littlefinger wants to take Sansa to the Vale with him, but the Tyrells want sansa to marry into their house so they can eventually claim Winterfell.  Littlefinger and the Tyrells are pushing two seperate agendas in their plans for Sansa.

991	LastDragonLives	2013-04-24	who's Locke?The character they created to replace the Bloody Mummers I believe?  It's been a while but Vargo was the guy who cut off Jaime's hand and they were a group of outlaws.  Not really a huge change, but not sure why they would do this.  And Locke was under the Bolton banners I think, so he would be under obligation to return him to Robb.  I doubt Robb would have wanted Jaime's hand cut off without his consent, and the Northmen would know that so it doesn't make sense in that regard but whatever.
992	Druze	2013-04-25	I was under the assumption that one of the bigger climaxes this season along with RW will be the defense of Castle Black?  I assumed the season would end with Stannis joining the battle triumphantly much like Tywin did in Blackwater with Jon Snow holding out as long as he can much like Tyrion last srason with Stannis replacing Tywin as the conquering hero.  Anyone else think this is likely?
993	Druze	2013-04-25	I think it has to happen (Sam slaying the Other) I trust it will be satisfactorily presented.

Doesn't Davos read Sam's plea for help which then leads him to convince Stannis in moving to divert his forces north to the wall?I have to check.  I think the message that went to Pylos was from Castle Black.  It said they received messages from the Fist but also some ravens without messages.  It says loss of Mormont *feared* with all his stench, I mean strength.  Sam wouldnt have said anything like that in his message from the Fist - the rout had not quite happened. He wrote a lot of messages that never went off - just the first ones
995	rmholt	2013-04-25	Anyone else think the mutiny at Craster's isn't done yet? It seemed kind of short.I think it's done. What else is there to do?  Not much else happens in the books except the stuff obviously skipped.  Anyway nobody is naked so they wont stretch it out <G>
996	rmholt	2013-04-25	Can someone tell me what the heck is going on in the intro (where the cities etc are modeled) in Astapor with those long linear forms that look like an unusually well organized set of train tracks with walls rising at the end of the columns a la Survivor? that is one creepy harpy though.
997	TheWhiteRabbit	2013-04-25	I think it's done. What else is there to do?  Not much else happens in the books except the stuff obviously skipped.  Anyway nobody is naked so they wont stretch it out <G>Well hopefully Grenn and Ed got away because it looks like Rast's crew has taken over
998	TalalOfDorne	2013-04-25	Though not in the book, Cersei and Tywin was one of my favorite scenes in the season. Though Im not sure about "him not undermining her for being a woman"
999	Conchobar	2013-04-25	Wouldn't Theon have known from Ramsay's accent tthat he wasn't from Saltcliffe?
1000	mafalda	2013-04-25	I really wish the scene at Craster's Keep was done better. It was just chaos. You couldn't tell who was who, and it made it seem like the entire NW attacked the Keep. It wasn't done justice. They could have totally cut Bran's scene to add more time to this one.
Some other posters have said that maybe they will go back to it in the next episode, but I can't see how. The only person they follow in the NW is Sam and he took off with Gilly and babe already!

1001	LastDragonLives	2013-04-25	I was under the assumption that one of the bigger climaxes this season along with RW will be the defense of Castle Black?  I assumed the season would end with Stannis joining the battle triumphantly much like Tywin did in Blackwater with Jon Snow holding out as long as he can much like Tyrion last srason with Stannis replacing Tywin as the conquering hero.  Anyone else think this is likely?I hope it will be in there, I think some of it has to be, but like the rest of this season I think they will cut it dramatically short.  Remember, first Jon has to have his love affair with Ygritte, who we hopefully see naked (love redheads, even though she is grimy), then he has to assualt their camp, Bran warging or whatever as Summer assisting, and then Jon escapes to defend Castle Black.  If they do it right, this should extend over a few episodes.  Anyone know if there are only 10 episodes this season?  I wish they could make it 13, but I guess the budget for this show is probably pretty outraegous to begin with.  People who think that Joffrey will be killed this season are sorely mistaken and who knows what else they will change.  How they end up doing the Bran scenes from ADWD is anyone's guess, I would think a lot of computer graphics and what not would be necessary.  The whole Sansa plot is unfolding strangely too, I don't see who is going to play the part of Dontos, and I really don't think her marriage to Tyrion will take place this season.  I also have no idea who will give her the veil of death, possibly the Queen of Thorns just to take all the speculation from the books out which they seem to like to do these days.  As far as Stannis defending Castle Black, we don't even know where Melissandre is going, that was never in the book, so who knows.  It would be pretty hard for them to just leave that out I would think.

1003	JMJ	2013-04-25	Can someone tell me what the heck is going on in the intro (where the cities etc are modeled) in Astapor with those long linear forms that look like an unusually well organized set of train tracks with walls rising at the end of the columns a la Survivor? that is one creepy harpy though.Yeah, I noticed that too. My theory is that the tracks represent the slaving/slaves/slave trade somehow. The harpy is indeed huge and scary. I keep looking at the intro for clues, but I've not noticed any true "giveaways" that haven't been noticed before. Also, now that the search function is back operational, There are 2-3 opening credit threads that are older. Some other interesting findings and questions I've had since then:- Will they keep Astapor now that Dany is moving on to Yunkai?- Winterfell has had smoke rising from it during this entire season - nice touch- Riverrun I think has the water gate included- Can't wait to see if they show Dorne, Braavos, Volantis eventually

We've never seen him before, or at least I haven't. I don't think they really established WHY those members did what they did, they've only said once about Craster feeding a pig better than the NW. They could have used the previous episodes really leading up to it, really showing how disgruntled those members were. Obviously they were going for chaos, but in MY humble opinion, it could have been filmed better. Several other posters have their gripe about it too.I simply pay attention. Thank you.

I hope it will, it's one of the bigger storylines from ASOS!Unfortunately, there are only 10 eps this season. The episode titles have been posted, and I think 8 is titled The Bear and Maiden Fair which leads me to think Tyrion and Sansa's wedding will take place during that ep.I kind of hope that they will have Ros fill the role of Dontos, since she is LF's right hand man anyway (or woman). Then I hope he does Ros just like he did Dontos and off her. I'm sorry, I am not a fan of her character, and this little deal she has with Varys! She was ok first season, didn't care for her second season, now I'm just over her!I wish they had more episodes too. We only get it once a year too, but I understand it must cost a fortune to make this show. Also, does anyone here know anything abut CGI and why it's so expensive?
1006	Honey Badger	2013-04-25	Oh geez. I mean, it was dark, you couldn't see anything, they didn't show many faces. Who was the guy that called Craster a bastard?

Thank you.I thought it was fine.  They were starving their asses off, most couldn't fit inside the house, they just lost at the Fist, and everyone was on edge.  They've complained during multiple scenes about how hungry they are, especially the one agitator.  I think that was Chett, who was pissed at Sam taking his steward position and wanted to slice himself a rasher of bacon off of Sam the "Piggy."  If they telegraphed it any more it would have spoiled the surprise.
1007	Sword of the Morning Wood	2013-04-25	I thought they made it abundantly clear that there was tension among the NW all the way back from the Fist. Last week, Rast was talking about 'having to look out for themselves' as Craster wasn't feeding them well and Mormont wasn't doing anything about it. Then it all came to a head as Craster was eating meat round his fire whilst the NW were expected to wait outside in the cold with sawdusty bread. Craster's remark about slitting the throats of the sick and injured just  sparked what had been building up for a while. How anyone could watch the show and not understand what led to the mutiny, I don't know.
1008	Silverx2	2013-04-25	the chaos being mentioned was the NW members loyal to the old bear fighting with the NW members who were allied with the group that killed him.
I believe in the book, crasters daughters were raped and all things that come with sacking a keep(in this case, hut) so i wouldn't be surprised to see next episode open with the aftermath of the battle.
1009	TheWhiteRabbit	2013-04-25	They at least could have shown some more action sequences at the mutiny and in Astrapor. Maybe they saved the budget for Castle Black and Yunkai. However, if those prove underwhelming as well I'll be thoroughly disappointed

Here is my review. We do all episodes.
I was slightly disappointed with the series until this episode!
1012	JMJ	2013-04-25	I thought they made it abundantly clear that there was tension among the NW all the way back from the Fist.

Craster's remark about slitting the throats of the sick and injured just  sparked what had been building up for a while. How anyone could watch the show and not understand what led to the mutiny, I don't know.Agreed. The scene where Sam stops marching, Rast wants to leave him there, and Mormont makes Rast personally ensure Sam makes it was clearly the show's foreshadowing of discontent on Rast's part, and it's also a nod to the stuff in the book with Small Paul carrying Sam before the Others attack, although obviously that scene was changed up significantly.
1013	mafalda	2013-04-25	I thought it was fine.  They were starving their asses off, most couldn't fit inside the house, they just lost at the Fist, and everyone was on edge.

I just think they could have shown more of him than the one bastard line.They at least could have shown some more action sequences at the mutiny and in Astrapor. Maybe they saved the budget for Castle Black and Yunkai. However, if those prove underwhelming as well I'll be thoroughly disappointedThis. It was very rushed, as was everything else in this episode. We could have totally done without Bran, and it would have been more screen time for more important events. The last half was the best part of the episode. And they definitely cheated us on the timing, it was only 53 minutes! I don't know much about television filming and time, but it was definitely one of the shorter episodes. I remember us posters discussing this same issue last season.
1014	Druze	2013-04-25	Yeah, I figured it was probably Chett. I just think they could have shown more of him than the one bastard line.This. It was very rushed, as was everything else in this episode.

And they definitely cheated us on the timing, it was only 53 minutes! I don't know much about television filming and time, but it was definitely one of the shorter episodes. I remember us posters discussing this same issue last season.They can't add episodes as that's just not how it's done in Hollywood.  Everything is negotiated, decided upon and allocated with time, budget beforehand.  Shows are bought by the season with a set number of episodes usually. We are however going to have almost an extra episode of GOT this season as they announced last year during production that episodes will run longer equaling something like a 40-45 minute longer season this time around.   If they could only cut down on the credits, which they aren't allowed to, they could squeeze more in but so many people work on the show in so many locations that the credits are longer than most shows both the opening and closing ones
1015	TheDarkOne	2013-04-25	It's really simple....
The show focuses on big moments! RW, PW, The Old Bear's death, Jamie's hand etc. The problem is that by focusing so much on the big moments, they neglect the slow build that goes into them, therefore degrading the overall experience. From a mile away, you can see the potential for problems with the RW. The same as with the Old Bear's death, there wasn't the right kind of build up to raise the emotional level to that of the books.
Most people I know could care less about Robb and find him annoying and a horrible leader. In fact, I've met more fans of Tywin than Robb. This is a real problem for the show and certainly a sign of how poorly they have handled creating appropriate amounts of character development.
1016	MoA«t	2013-04-25	Oh geez. I mean, it was dark, you couldn't see anything, they didn't show many faces. Who was the guy that called Craster a bastard? We've never seen him before, or at least I haven't. I don't think they really established WHY those members did what they did, they've only said once about Craster feeding a pig better than the NW.

Thank you."You're a daughter-fucking, wildling bastard" is Burn Gorman from Torchwood. He was in last week's episode, and said, "You feed that pig better than you feed us."How much more "disgruntled" do you want them to be? Did you miss the funeral scene where Edd said the corpse smelled good, and Rast said he was "starved to death"? They've been "disgruntled" since they had to help Sam on the road in episode 2. You think having them at Craster's should last more than two episodes?I kind of hope that they will have Ros fill the role of Dontos, since she is LF's right hand man anyway (or woman). Then I hope he does Ros just like he did Dontos and off her. I'm sorry, I am not a fan of her character, and this little deal she has with Varys! She was ok first season, didn't care for her second season, now I'm just over her!I hope Ros outlives everyone.Also, does anyone here know anything abut CGI and why it's so expensive?Because it takes TIME, and needs a lot of people.http://www.youtube.c...h?v=i4GkA6rIPDcAnd if you have 30min - this is how they did Blackwater:http://www.youtube.c...h?v=1IKfzFlN4Os

Obviously they were going for chaos, but in MY humble opinion, it could have been filmed better. Several other posters have their gripe about it too.I simply pay attention. Thank you.I don't think you do pay attention, since the entire argument leading to Craster's death is about how Bannen was killed by starvation, Rast mentions he has a hidden larder, and Edd talking about how good a burning man smelled, Craster saying how he needs to feed his wives, and Karl saying quite obviously that they were starving and the bread his wives gave him was not sufficient. These are all very obvious points regarding the NW starvation. And if you watched the scene when Sam is fleeing and didn't hear the obvious sounds of sword-on-sword clanging and understand there was a fight, you can't have been paying attention. You also see Grenn and Edd fighting against their own brothers.I'm not arguing that the scene could have been shot better. Sure, almost every scene could be. But to say it wasn't obvious is only giving credence to the fact that if you don't pay attention, you have no idea what's going on. It was dark? Of course it was dark!!

I just think they could have shown more of him than the one bastard line.I thought he was Chett too, but apparently the name he's billed as is Karl - as in Clubfoot Karl.I hope Ros outlives everyone.I feel the same way, and I have no strong like or dislike for her. All the hate just makes me laugh. It's amazing how angry people get at incredibly innocuous two minute scenes like her chatting with Varys, even accusing her of being a Mary Sue(?). Are they forgetting the American Psycho scene with Joffrey last year, or when Littlefinger threatened to sell her to a man who mutilates women unless she "bucks up"? I think "Mary Sue" has become just another way of saying "female character I dislike" in the online lexicon. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />

1026	'96Buck	2013-04-26	The Sansa/Loras proposal won't last long, and Tywin may put Loras in the KG specifically to prevent the marriage, then set up Sansa/Tyrion.I predict this.  Just as the Mad King did to Twyin by naming Jamie to the Kingsguard.
1027	'96Buck	2013-04-26	Wouldn't Theon have known from Ramsay's accent tthat he wasn't from Saltcliffe?Or that they had doubled-back?  Theon's in a little bit of shock, or something.  Certainly his head is spinning from his choice to betray Robb, screwed up relationships with his sister and father, everything going wrong @ Winterfell, being betrayed by his men, captured, and tortured.  Hard to blame him, really.
1028	MoA«t	2013-04-26	Seriously, that's what happens in the book. Nice try smartassTV series â<U+0089>  Books. Or are you actually expecting them to be the same?If you want Raider's of the Lost Ark details, why not write a check for $100million to HBO, and ask nicely.Personally, eyes melting on screen would be complete cheese, and this show isn't, so no, I don't care if it's "in the book", I'm glad it didn't happen. I don't need that kind of detail to understand what's happening in the story.

1029	nara	2013-04-27	LOVED this episode! Jaime in the mud and trying to fight back was very affecting.  Glad they kept the hand and him drinking horsepiss.  The latter made me so angy when I read it!Tywin and Cersei -- flawless--but there's another thread about this.   I liked that she asked about Jaime because it will be a good precursor to Jaime's dialogue in the bath scene.Dany + dragons +dracarys = pure AWESOME.  Liked the way they showed the Unsullied coming to her side as free men.Death of Mormont was better in books due to the plotting, but this was good too.Liked the Varys and sorceror scene--creepy.Like TV Margaery playing Joffrey. It makes me wonder what he'll do to make the Tyrells turn against him.I'm not sure I get the Theon scenes.  In the book, Ramsay let Kyra and Theon think they were escaping before hunting them down, but this feels weirder.Liked the set up for the Hound/Beric scene.  Looking forward to it!"You sound like a bloody woman!" well, Brienne was never this sexist in the books tbh.I don't think Brienne was being sexist--just trying to stay something to get a spark of life back into Jaime. Very similar to him calling her wench when she's depressed after the RW on the ride to KL/I think you can take it either way.  I mean the who killed Joffrey is a big angle in the PW and so far Tyrion, Margaery, QOT, and now Tywin have all said something that could be construed as I will kill him if I have to.I wonder if they'll turn it into a "who shot JR?" type of story...What really gets me about the Cersei/Tywin scene was the crowd pleasing line of "You are not as smart as you think you are." We as book readers know that Cersei eventually delves into paranoid madness and makes rash, idiotic decisions because of this. But in THIS moment with Tywin she is absolutely correct that House Tyrell is plotting and angling for the throne in their own subtle way. Cersei is right to be wary of Margaery and Olenna because they end up being instrumental in assassinating her son. Joffrey's death then drives Cersei over the edge and she becomes a truly wicked character, but in THIS moment she still has her head in the game and she sees the Tyrells for what they are. It's Tywin who cannot see the forest for the trees in this matter. The Tyrells might be as devious as the Lannisters but they are just as ambitious and scheming. Just in a different way.The thing with Cersei is that in the midst of her incompetence, she has flashes of brilliance and insight.  That's why she can say thing like "when you play the game of thrones..." which is one of the truest lines in the entire series, but also be stupid enough to not recognize that Joff is a monster.
1030	Joyful Union	2013-04-27	I wonder if they'll turn it into a "who shot JR?" type of story...I would totally buy an "I poisoned Joffrey" T-shirt

And when it comes to the Tyrells, it's not really paranoia if they are out to get you. The Tyrells were a big blind spot for Tywin, and his refusal to entertain Cersei's concerns is the first glimmer of this. He does have a point when he implies that Margaery being a  civilizing influence on Joffrey might not be a bad thing, though.

He does have a point when he implies that Margaery being a  civilizing influence on Joffrey might not be a bad thing, though.this reminds me of the old joke "just because i think everyone is out to get me doesn't mean i'm paranoid." ba dep bep.if cersei's worries were focused solely on the tyrells then everyone would have praised her astuteness for figuring out they were a threat. but she thinks everyone is an enemy and therefore does indeed show paranoia. i don't know if the tyrells were a blind spot for tywin or if he just didn't think there was much trouble they could cause. let's face it, other than killing joff, there isn't much they do cause. (ok, writing that has to be the most surreal thing i've ever written and yet it makes sense in this story.) they don't really start "taking over" until after tywin's dead and cersei starts making moves on her own.

He does have a point when he implies that Margaery being a  civilizing influence on Joffrey might not be a bad thing, though.I thought it was left ambiguous in the books as to whether or not the Tyrells were plotting against Cersei. Since her absolutely insane lens is the only one we've seen them through in Kings landing, its difficult to ascertain.

Since her absolutely insane lens is the only one we've seen them through in Kings landing, its difficult to ascertain.IMO that's also why Tywin paid no attention to Cersei's concerns re: The Tyrell's. It's a bit of the boy who cried wolf phenomenon. He probably chalked it up to her nuttiness.
1035	Knight	2013-04-27	It's really simple....The show focuses on big moments! RW, PW, The Old Bear's death, Jamie's hand etc. The problem is that by focusing so much on the big moments, they neglect the slow build that goes into them, therefore degrading the overall experience. From a mile away, you can see the potential for problems with the RW. The same as with the Old Bear's death, there wasn't the right kind of build up to raise the emotional level to that of the books.Most people I know could care less about Robb and find him annoying and a horrible leader. In fact, I've met more fans of Tywin than Robb. This is a real problem for the show and certainly a sign of how poorly they have handled creating appropriate amounts of character development.I agree that the charm of the books is in the little details that are often overlooked by the strong emphasis the show places on the big events. The charm of the series is in Martin's numerous references to popular culture, his brilliant technique of intertwining storylines and character arcs in a subtle manner and the eloborate history he has created for the setting of the books - all these are very, very difficult to convey to the screen. I saw that another poster had mentioned that the show's season should be stretched over a year with a weekly episode; the more hours available on-screen to cover the books, the more justice it would have done to the world Martin has created.That said, I think the producers of the show are doing an excellent job in what they're aiming for: to keep the viewer hooked to an epic show that really kicks the adrenaline levels. Dracarys, angry spitfirin' Hound, Jamie and Brienne interactions - the show is excellent in terms of of character development (although this does not account to all characters *StanniscoughCatelyncough*), and build-up of suspense and plot twists.

1037	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-27	Congratulations, you've discovered television!Also, there are probably more BookTywin fans than BookRobb fans.Ooh, I don't know about that. I think this forum isn't that indicative of the general perception of characters since we're all so obsessed and overanalyze everything. I think Robb gets extra crap on here because he did do some stupid things, but overall he was honorable and just and fighting for a good cause, whereas Tywin ordered the death of babies and is overall a pretty bad father and a petty man (As Oberyn points out).
1038	buff daddy	2013-04-27	Congratulations, you've discovered television!Also, there are probably more BookTywin fans than BookRobb fans.TVRobb is still a terrible, whiny character no matter how his book version stacks up to TV or Book Tywin's popularity. Catelyn is the only one who I'll be sad about seeing get killed at the Red Wedding when it happens on TV.

He probably chalked it up to her nuttiness.Kevan (in the books) seems to be seeing the truth - in between Tywin (who probably couldnt imagine anyone challenging him) and Cersei (turning into Aerys) and the Tyrells are definitely seeing how far they can go.
1040	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-27	TVRobb is still a terrible, whiny character no matter how his book version stacks up to TV or Book Tywin's popularity. Catelyn is the only one who I'll be sad about seeing get killed at the Red Wedding when it happens on TV.I quite like TV Robb. Not moreso than book Robb but I still like him. For all of his mistakes and hypocrisy, he's a boy shoved into a terrible situation in which he could not possibly win. But he is the north. The northerners we love are at his mercy, so to speak. At one point his men idolized him. But then his men grew discontent, disregarding the victories, because being a King is more than just winning battles. I think the show portrayal illustrates that the northerners were also hasty and irresponsible in choosing him to be King Robb.He is Ned Stark's son but yet not enough to make it cheesy. Maester Aemon tells Jon that Ned is one in a million. I think Robb is proof of that, but he hasn't lost sympathy from me because he chose to marry an actual woman. It's stupid and tragic, but I don't know if I were him I'd be much better. That's why I still like Robb. People will call him a buffoon or whatever, but I think he is more like most men than people would care to admit. But the point is he's not quite a King, in contrast to Tywin Lannister who doesn't hold the title but may as well should. In the show I see that, because in the books Robb was never really a hero. Jon remarks at the wall (to himself) that he was to remembered as bastard, turncloak, oathbreaker where Robb would be remembered as a hero. But that line sealed it for me that Jon's naivety perfectly explained to me that Robb wasn't really a hero.His whining is blown out of proportion. He whines a couple times in S2 which is sort of rational. Cat came back with a shit bargain for a "King." I just think that his character is human and reasonable, not ideal, which is why I'm ok with him. What King that sat the throne was a perfect King? There were maybe 5.

1041	Joyful Union	2013-04-28	TVRobb is still a terrible, whiny character no matter how his book version stacks up to TV or Book Tywin's popularity. Catelyn is the only one who I'll be sad about seeing get killed at the Red Wedding when it happens on TV.I could see how someone could find him terrible, but whiny? He whines more in the books! TvRobb is more confident if anything, more arrogant. In any case, I didn't care much at all about Robb in the books, he's barely there. I only really cared when he died because Catelyn cared, and I think many people would agree with me.

I only really cared when he died because Catelyn cared, and I think many people would agree with me.I agree with this.  The way that he handles Edmure in the last episode is a prime example of how arrogant he is.  Particularly the last line:  "I would have told you at this gathering if you had just been patient."Alright Robb... I'll just sit on my hands and wait for you while Lannister forces are camped across the river from me.(I am an Edmure fan though, so I am totally biased)

I thought that Edmure was fairly justified in his attack, and if Robb wanted him to follow orders, he should have been more specific. "Hold Riverrun" is so vague, it could mean defending around Riverrun, preventing people from encircling Riverrun, basically anything.
1044	Reposado	2013-04-28	Congratulations, you've discovered television!Also, there are probably more BookTywin fans than BookRobb fans.Youmean, he's discovred television that is not donethat well.
1045	Rashtibram	2013-04-28	The farther we get into this season, the more I think both the Red and Purple weddings are going to happen this year.Red Wedding will end the season in episode nine, but the purple wedding will most likely happen in the first couple episodes next season.
1046	Rashtibram	2013-04-28	so far the show added theme's and stuff...IS Sansa not going to be taken away with Little Finger?No, she is. Tywin's gonna marry Sansa to tyrion, and then next season, Littlefinger spirits her away. it's just like the book, the only change is that they switched willas with loras.
1047	Rashtibram	2013-04-28	I don't think the purple wedding will be in this season. From what I can tell:
ep. 5: beric vs hound, jon + ygritte sex scene, robb executing karstark, maybe end with beric coming back to life
ep. 6: littlefinger gives his 'climb' speech to somebody, and tormund and others scale the wall
ep. 7: bear pit scene, jaime saves brienne, dany exiles jorah
ep. 8: imp wedding, sansa and tyrion scenes, dany meets daario and the Second Sons
ep. 9: red wedding: probably will take up all of the episode, just like blackwater took up its episode
ep.10: dany conquers yunkai, and debatably the season will end with UnCat coming back to life.
1048	'96Buck	2013-04-29	Did anyone else notice that comment Cercei made to Tywin " Perhaps you should try  stoppong from doing what he likes"  " I  will" ?  Is Cersei giving Tywin permission to kill Joffrey.  Has this been discussed?No, she isn't.
1049	'96Buck	2013-04-29	I agree with this.  The way that he handles Edmure in the last episode is a prime example of how arrogant he is.

1050	gwhh	2013-05-02	I don't remember reading in the books that Podrick Payne was such a TOTAL stud in the bedroom?  Did I miss/forget that parts in the books or that something they added for the TV show??
1051	GeneralChen	2013-05-03	I'm a little surpised they kept Dontos out of the show.  I understand that Baelish needs screen time but I think the story would have been more surprising if they kept it like the book with his character. 
Also, a lot is getting skipped over with Dany.  I was hoping for Mormont trying to kiss her, or the truth coming out of him spying on her, or at least a little lesbian action lol.  Guess they want to focus more on her conquering.
1052	CKPS63	2013-05-04	Gods!!!! With all the great things this episode had, all anyone can talk about for 2 plus pages is Ros hatred? I normally don't get my hackles up about people's opinions, which of course they have every right to voice, but Seven bloody Hells have I grown weary of hearing the same old Ros complaints on these boards for 2+ seasons.	 Every time the writers give her a line people find something in it to complain about: "The writers make her seem smarter than Varys..." "Ros is naked too much..." Ros is only good for being naked and she isn't naked enough..." "The actress is terrible..." "Ros isn't even a book character..." Maybe I will compile a list of the 1000 most common complaints about Ros and number them so the persistent complaints can read more like...Ros #768...Handy shorthand so I can get to fresh and interesting opinions rather than stale ones dating back to the pilot episode.	 This is coming from someone who is much closer to being a book purist than a show changing apologist. I didn't like Ros either...but I learned to live with it rather than beating everyone who will listen or read over the head with the same complaints over and over. I learned to accept the role and have come to like Esme Bianco. Furthermore, she has played a valuable and, at times necessary, role in the show in a number of ways. The way D&D have chosen to adapt the show, right or wrong, made Ros, or a character like her, necessary.	 Sorry for the angry rant...but I stand by everything in it, and I needed to vent it. I am far from a prolific poster, but I do spend a good deal of time on these boards and having to sort through the same rants for pages at a time for years is getting real old.You are right on all counts.  I have read the books dozens of times, but simply can't wrap my head around the "purist" approach to the shows in some of these forum, or the incessant Ros hatred.  I LIKE that they've made interesting changes, and have actually come to like Esme Bianco in this role.  I'm almost sure, however, she's going into the drink shortly after LF fetches Sansa following the PW.
1053	rmholt	2013-07-10	Rewatched this recently and wanted to comment on something.  The Fermat spiral in the end scene is also seen in the end scene of the season finale

Tyrion wants vengence now on the person who ordered him to be killed at Blackwater, and Varys is telling him that sometimes Vengence comes with Patience.

Also I hope that somehow Jorah will be the one who kills the a-hole who killed the Old Bear.
1065	Olligarchy	2013-04-22	Holy crap that episode was awesome. Whilst the Old Bears death was tragic, seeing Dany speak Valyrian was awesome and well done.
1066	Rhasgul	2013-04-22	Is Loras Kingsguard?Nope, why would they suggest him as a match in marriage if he was?

1068	maqzzz	2013-04-22	Alizard. the thing is, that paticular series of events is not in the books, so we can only speculate. i would say, with what i know from the books, that ramsay is trying to completely mess with theon, to break him psychologically. you have to remember, theon still doesnt know that that boy is ramsay bolton, his captor himself.
1069	Tourniquet	2013-04-22	Nope, why would they suggest him as a match in marriage if he was? As it's a position for life where you can have no wives nor kids.Precisely why I was asking, I thought they named him Kingsguard when the Tyrell's saved the city.
1070	Alizard Pyre	2013-04-22	Thanks for the answer, it's good to think we'll be all waiting for the answers, either book-readers or non-book-readers.
Gotta love that Ramsay Bolton (or is there a special bastard's name near the Dreadfort?) him plus Locke really give that house a badass reputation.

1072	Arrow	2013-04-22	I still feel nervous for Sansa - I feel like the less she says to Margaery the better - I just don't trust that little schemer! Loved her granny's' little rant about roses and other stronger house names/words. When Varys and granny were talking, it felt like someone brewing up a homemade nightmare. Someone's going to take it in the shorts if those two are plotting, that's for sure. (Sounds like LF's in for it.)
Arya so far is safe, thank goodness. She's a pistol. Love that she stood up to the Hound - loved the "Is being born a Clegane a crime?" part - poor old horrible Hound, nobody loves him.
I didn't get the part about Catelyn and Bran in the tree. Weird.

Yet if Margaery says Sansa could marry Loras, I see it as an attempt to broker an official alliance in the most "common" way. I can't see how it could be a trap. The Tyrell are the Warden of the South, they have a foot on King's Landing (whatever Olenna says, if she came herself to the capital it means marrying the King isn't such a bad idea after all) and now they want to reach out far north.
What I thought when Varys and Olenna talked was: Varys seek powerfull allies. He sees Olenna as one potential ally and tries to convince her to help him fulfilling his own plans. After all what business does she have with LF? None. That's why Varys uses Sansa as a way to interest her and make way to his other ideas about LF...

To let them think they have a chance, then he sets out with his men and normally a pack of dogs, recaptures them and brings them back to the Dreadfort.

(NTTAWWI) - So while she's seemingly handing Sansa the perfect answer to all her young girlish dreams of great ladies marrying handsome, dashing knights, there's a stink-bomb hidden in the offering. Sansa would not have children, she would not be wanted by her husband, marriage to Loras would turn into yet another horrible nightmare for her.Poor Sansa! Will she ever find the true love she wants so much? So far in this TV series, it seems everyone's using her for their own ends, and nobody so far (outside her family) has been genuinely concerned about her feelings or a good outcome for her, except Shea, but we know Shea is also kind of jealous of her because Tyrion considers Sansa to be beautiful. At least Tyrion treats her kindly in a sincere way, not like LF, who's slimy about it, like he is about everything. I must read faster. I've got to find out if Sansa has a good outcome.
1081	Aripyanfar	2013-04-23	Sansa's lower lip wobbling when Margaery held out all her dreams coming true to her, along with the prospect of a sister who WANTS to be her sister, was so emotional.  Last season taught Sansa that Dream Princes can hide monsters, and she was getting pretty good at lying to save her life, and saying one thing but meaning another.  Now 14 year old Sansa* is falling for the Too Good To Be True thing AGAIN.  I'm worried for her.  We already know that Loras is gay, (I'm not getting any bi-sexual vibe) and is so not interested in Sansa that he couldn't even be bothered with a polite evasion about remembering giving her his "Favour", that red rose.  On the bright side, I don't think Sansa's *sexual* hormones have hit her yet, and she's really not ready for a marriage *bed*... for all she is so marriage crazy.
I loathed Sansa in Season 1, and later realised what great actors were playing Sansa and Joffrey, for me to unthinkingly loathe them like that.  Sansa has grown up a bit, but not much, but I LIKE that we still have what is essentially an innocent, very naive character, who has a very child-like helplessness in not accruing almost any useful survival skills in a dangerous world.  I just worry that she isn't open-eyed enough to accurately judge people enough to know who she should really rely on. 
I don't think that Margaery would be mean or cruel to Sansa as long as Sansa is helpful in Margaery's goal to be THE Queen.  I just don't believe that Margaery is really as attracted to Sansa as a sister/friend as she is pretending so hard to be.  I think Margaery in her heart just couldn't love Sansa when Sansa is so obviously out of her depth in comparison to herself.  Sansa is at best, a pet rabbit to Margaery.
The only gripe I have about Season 3 so far is that for me, the Arya scenes aren't long enough.  However, this is very much an ensemble show, and Arya got more than her fair share of great scenes last season.
*Season 1, Episode 1, Cercei remarked that the 13 year old Sansa was very tall for her age
1082	Ivy	2013-04-23	This one was awesome, especially the end of the episode. I wonder what will happen next with khaleesi and her new army and ofc with her dragons.
And omg, poor Jaimie, I mean I don't like him and he did awful things, but his arm.. :S But he is a coward, though.
To sum up, this episode is more and more exciting with every minute.

1083	ma_liky	2013-04-23	Hi everybody! I am new here, and I am not a book reader, not just yet /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />, but I do not mind a spoiler here and there.
Well I loved this ep so much I had to share.
Where to start...
Jamie - Didnt feel nothin for him, just so surprised when it happend it blow my mind. I like what they did to him and to his character. Reality Bites, Dude!!! Loved when Brienne told him he is acting like a girl. Boo hoo they cut of my hand, sissy they should have cut bouth of them. I am not sure where their soryline is going but I like it. I like seeing Jamie sufer.
Nights Watch - Didnt quite get what happened out there and why. I am sorry for Lord Commander Mormont  if he is truly dead, with GoT you never know. And I am very woried about Sam alone with a girl and a newborn. Scarry.
Theon - Stupide, stupide, stupide man. How can he be so stupide? I dont know who this person is who captured him and what does he want. I think it is information about Bran and Rickon, this story line is complet mistery to me, or I missed something. If I did please tell me /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
Tyrion - I love him. He is one of my fovourite characters. Loved the interaction between him and Varys and how Varys told him the story of becoming the way he is. He will be a great ally to Tyron.
Varys - For the first time I have heard his story. I always had this question about him and of his goal. I can understand Little Finfers motives and gaols, but Varys is a mistery to me. I love his plan to obstruc LF's plans with Sansa, I would love if Sansa would to marry Loras but I know it is not going to happen. I read here that Sansa is going to marry Tyrion, I imagine this would happen when Papa Lanister hears of a plan for Sansa and Loras and he will not allow for Tyrells to claim the north someday. It will be nicely played.
And for the end...
Deany -  Talking in Valaryan, beautiful to hear. Take that master slave for every B-word. I loved her character from the begining of the series but in this ep she blow me away, I knew something is going to happen that the Dragon will burn the master slave, but this was amazing. Her character matured so much, I loved her, every thing, this is how a conqueror behives. So strong and beautiful, and roothless in her belifs, she freed them all and throw away the wip. Great!!! Seeing her with army and three dragons who fly above. She is ready to take on the world.
1084	Ser Steven	2013-04-23	Hi everybody! I am new here, and I am not a book reader, not just yet /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />, but I do not mind a spoiler here and there.Well I loved this ep so much I had to share.Where to start...Jamie - Didnt feel nothin for him, just so surprised when it happend it blow my mind. I like what they did to him and to his character. Reality Bites, Dude!!! Loved when Brienne told him he is acting like a girl. Boo hoo they cut of my hand, sissy they should have cut bouth of them. I am not sure where their soryline is going but I like it. I like seeing Jamie sufer.Nights Watch - Didnt quite get what happened out there and why. I am sorry for Lord Commander Mormont  if he is truly dead, with GoT you never know. And I am very woried about Sam alone with a girl and a newborn. Scarry.Theon - Stupide, stupide, stupide man. How can he be so stupide? I dont know who this person is who captured him and what does he want. I think it is information about Bran and Rickon, this story line is complet mistery to me, or I missed something. If I did please tell me /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Tyrion - I love him. He is one of my fovourite characters. Loved the interaction between him and Varys and how Varys told him the story of becoming the way he is. He will be a great ally to Tyron.Varys - For the first time I have heard his story.

If you look at what he is tied up to you should recognize the apparatus. You have seen this before in the show. Once you figure out where you saw the torture device, you should be able to find out where, and if, you were really paying attention throughout the show, also who he is with.Also Welcome to the boards, and I like reading your take on the characters. Hope you stick around so I can read how you feel about them as the story goes on. As someone who has read the books, it's always interesting to get a non book readers view on the story.

1085	Edgy	2013-04-23	Varys is one of the most intriguing characters in the story. His scenes with Tyrion and the Queen of Thorns were extremely powerful and a lot of good dialogue and repartee between him and both of the others respectively.

I just watched that segment again, and the camera angles they're using when Varys is talking to Tyrion and opening the box seem to emphasize a new, more sinister feel they're giving him. The shot of him in the grungy mirror is an excellent device - first time I saw it, it gave me chills. They also use tight close-ups of his face when he's talking to Ros. They hadn't done that a whole lot in earlier episodes, it's like they're saying pay attention to this guy, he's becoming more important now.He says he hates magic, and all around him it's expanding as the dragons grow and develop and their magic grows stronger. I wonder how he'll cope with that development. Maybe the sorcerer is supposed to serve as a hedge against that - or maybe he's just going to take revenge and kill him. It'll be interesting to see.

1088	litespeed74	2013-04-25	Hello everyone, just joined the forum here. 
Love the show and love the characters. (good and bad)
Last episode was pretty amazing.  I fight every day to try and find some spoilers but overall I do a good job being patient!
I'm really intrigued with John Snows situation.  I wonder if he's committed to the NW or if he's converted.
The other story of course is the whole "warg" situation.
I don't trust anyone and I'm still worried about a few characters.  Robs wife and also Margaery. 
This is a great start to the season. Lots of changes.
cheers
1089	Arrow	2013-04-25	hi litespeed- I believe it's understood that Jon Snow is doing a double agent thing in the TV show right now.Welcome, also. /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />

1090	RedChick	2013-04-25	Hi! I'm new here as well! I'm still reading the first book but I'm almost done with it and heading toward the second one soon. Unfortunately I have been spoiled about some major storylines but I don't let it bother me.
Anyways this episode, wow. Where to begin?
I thoroughly enjoyed every scene with Varys, he just almost stole the entire episode for me
The last scene with Dany and the Unsullied was badass (funny, I Iiked her in season 1, found her incredibly annoying in season 2, but she has really been awesome so far this season)
I'm seriously loving Olenna Tyrell and Margaery continuing to manipulate Joffery and being a thorn to Cersei's side has made for some LOL moments for me
The adventures between Jaime and Brienne has also been a consistent highlight for me
Theon and the "Boy"- I know what's gonna happen and I fear for Theon. I don't hate Theon but I do find him to be stupid and also incredibly tragic.
Still can't believe we're still at the beginning of the season and so much has happened! Can't wait for the things to come.
1091	Lord of the Tides	2013-04-24	First time poster, great mids here with some superb ideas, love it so far.My little contribution is the following: after watching the Ros - Varys scene and in the beginning they are discussing Pod and his encounter with the whores that saved Tyrion some money. While reading post about Pod on this forum, it was always presumed that he was just well endowed, but Ros mentions that he "isnÂ´t bigger that others" and it is what he does, that impressed the whores. While itÂ´s all well and good for him,  I am wondering about the reason to put this in the series in the first place. Is it purely a "breaking the ice" intro for Ros and Varys, sort of start with light rumours and get onto the juicier bits as the report progresses, or will PodÂ´s personal life be of a significance to us going forward both in the series and the books? Who is the woman Pod likely to "make happy" going forward (marriage or otherwise), presumably he survives the encounter with unCat, or is it just idle gossip, with no meaning; feel free to speculate.
1092	freetickles	2013-04-24	Maybe Brienne? Or Sansa or Arya?
I don't know that it's any more than an attempt at humor, though, trying to make Pod seem more interesting.
1093	Inquisitor Glokta	2013-04-24	Who is the woman Pod likely to "make happy" going forward (marriage or otherwise), presumably he survives the encounter with unCat, or is it just idle gossip, with no meaning; feel free to speculate.This is how he will survive the encounter with unCat, she will keep him aroung as a boytoy and will totally forget about killing Freys

1094	shiola	2013-04-24	When it was first brought up last week, I was sure it had some sort of plot relevance.  I thought  maybe the whores got Pod to let something important slip (since he is with Tyrion a lot/Tyrion trusts him/etc) and therefore he didn't have to pay because they used him.  So when Tyrion (and Bronn) asked Pod for "details" and to tell them "everything", I thought Tyrion wanted to listen to see if Pod fucked up somehow.
But then coming on here I realized it was just a joke.  As a reader, I think I just over analyze things.  This is the show, not the books (which I have to constantly remind myself).  And on the show, there can be throw away scenes, things just for comic relief, etc, whereas in the books almost everything has some sort of underlying message.
I don't know why Ros and Varys were talking about it.  It seems like the joke is played out at this point, but maybe the writers like it.  But I don't think there's any underlying meaning anymore, and it's not foreshadowing or a hint.  They're building up Pod's character so we care more about when he is taken by UnCat, and they are doing it in a way that they find humorous.
That's my take, in a long-winded explanation.
1095	SnowStorm	2013-04-24	I think it's possible that the whores were paid by someone else, maybe to get info from Pod; and they didn't take the money because they're honorable, or maybe sending the money back was a sort of "message" from the other payer.
I really don't buy that this is just there for humor, especially since they mentioned it again in this episode.
1096	Winterz	2013-04-24	They're developing his character so we can actually care about him when he meets LS.
					
					
							Edited by Winterz, 24 April 2013 - 10:00 AM.
1097	SnowStorm	2013-04-24	Why build the character now with a silly whore joke when they have plenty of opportunity to do it when he travels with Brienne later on? Which is before the encounter with UnCat. They have a lot of time until that. Right now there's not really much point in wasting screen time to build Pod's character. It should be enough to keep him around Tyrion, being his shy, clumsy self, like in the books.
Thinking about it, the fact that the whore joke goes against the previous characterization should be a sign that there's more to it.
1098	juanml82	2013-04-24	If the whores aren't spying for LF and possibly not for Varys, they might be spying for Cersei.
However, if they are spies, they would have taken the money to cover their tracks. I don't know, there should be something about it, it can't just be a bad joke.

1099	Alice in Westeros	2013-04-24	This is how he will survive the encounter with unCat, she will keep him aroung as a boytoy and will totally forget about killing FreysThat made me laugh so much.But yeah, I find it hard to believe that they turned a character who was pretty much sexless/asexual in the books into a sex god just as a throwaway joke. I hope there is more to it. Did someone else pay without Roz' knowledge? Are they building him up to become a love interest for Sansa (he did have a crush on her in the books) or something like that? Or do they just think it will make him more interesting?It's going to be weird now when he'll share a bedroom with Brienne.

Or do they just think it will make him more interesting?It's going to be weird now when he'll share a bedroom with Brienne.LOL I haven't even considered that...I think they will build it up to a longterm joke.Maybe the tale of Podrick The Stud Payne will spread across the 7 kingdoms and when he travels with Brienne there will be a moment like:Random Brothelworker(RBW) heres Podrick's name.-RBW: "Are you the Podrick Payne?"-Pod: looks to the ground "Y... Y... Yes."RBW drags Pod into a room
1101	Penguin king	2013-04-24	I hate to reference TV tropes, but i think maybe this has something to do with it.There seems to be a cultural perception that a man needs to be sexualy active or else he's defective in some way. The show runners don't want us thinking Pod is a virgin, so they ridiculously overcompensate.That or it's just a cheap shot at raising a laugh with some frat-boy humor.

But still, maybe he'll replace some other character later on.As for him being mentioned in Ros and Varys conversation I think it was only to make the Spider less bitter, as he said he'd look out for her. So he just wouldn't go there and collect her information without having a bit of side-talk first.
1103	Silverx2	2013-04-24	they need to develop pod a bit now to give him a real reason for leaving once tyrion goes missing.
Pod is an outcast of sorts as shown throughout season 2, hes quiet awkward, and doesn't seem to have any friends. So when tyrion goes missing in the books pod goes off on this crazy adventure and kills people, assists brienne and begins to become a better sword fighter while training with brienne, which i think will play a bigger role in the later books.
But in order for all this to happen they need to build pod up a bit to make it less of a stretch that pod would do what he does in order to get tyrion back agian.

1107	Euron Pink Eye	2013-04-24	Maybe its Littlefinger using Pod as misdirection. Everyone will focus on that whilst he steals away Sansa etc, which is kind of happening at least for Tyrion
1108	King Tommen	2013-04-24	Some scenes are built simply for comic relief or to provide a little more exposure for a character who hasn't been given much to that point and there is no greater meaning intended.  This is clearly one of them.  No need to overanalyze...
1109	Sun	2013-04-24	It became obvious this week that the only significance of the Pod scene is its value as a running joke, and the chance to show some T&A in ep 3.

Littlefinger mentioned he knew it wasn't Ros and asked why Cersei thought it was so he's curious and intends to let Tywin know. I'm pretty sure that Cersei still thinks she had the right girl and is patting herself on the back about how smart she was. She was lucky that Tyrion was decent enough to care that Ros didn't get tortured even though she wasn't his love.

He treated them with respect and listened to them...something not a single one of them had probably ever experienced all things considered.
Of course I might have missed some of the dialog.

1116	Lord of the Tides	2013-04-25	That made me laugh so much.But yeah, I find it hard to believe that they turned a character who was pretty much sexless/asexual in the books into a sex god just as a throwaway joke.

I also doubt much info can be got from Pod, i mean he has trouble spitting out things he wants to say, let alone something he might consider a secret, and on that note does he know any secrets really or does Tyrion even have any secrets at this stage, his scenes with Cercei seem to suggest she considers him done now that "Daddy" is in town. and even if Podrick knew something and did tell the whores, surely they would just take his money anyway.The Brienne journey should have something to do with it, but I doubt D&D would move away from the book plot so much as to suggest a romance there, it would kinda ruin BrienneÂ´s character, since she would be asking unCat to spare them not for some "poor, random, innocent boyÂ´s" life, but for someone who threw a leg over her once or twice, sounds kinda cheep - Jaime deserves better.

Your explanation seems great, but you managed to fit it into 2 sentences, pretty much, not all that difficult was it?

1120	Qhorin Fivehands	2013-04-25	I don't think it is l worth looking to deep into this, the scenes with Pod are purely there for TV viewers so they don't forget him when he meets up with Brienne in Season 5 or so.
1121	The King Of Limbs	2013-04-25	My theory is that the Pod scene and the subsequent mentions are all foreshadowing of the "Lord's Kiss".
1122	Wall Builder	2013-04-25	I believe Littlefinger told his prostitutes to not take the money.  When Tyrion is getting the accounting books from Littlefinger, Littlefinger says to Tyrion "I understand that you owe your squire a significant debt".  Then a couple of sentences later he says "And I owe you a significant debt."  So Littlefinger is paying his debt to Tyrion by not taking his money for the services provided to Podrick.  Obviously, the arrangements for Podrick's deflowering were made in advance.  Tyrion knew who the three girls were beforehand - he describes them before they even come from behind their curtains.  He must have selected them himself because one of them says "You didn't tell me he was so handsome."  And I'm sure Littlefinger had to be be involved in the plans.  He probably also told his girls to not say anything about it so they are intentionally vague when Ros asked them ("No bigger than most", "Hard to describe", etc.) As to why he doesn't tell Tyrion that it's a freebie, I don't know.  Perhaps we'll find out later.  Or maybe Tyrion does know and is just playing along to make Podrick feel special.

1124	Hellauthere	2013-04-25	It's for the humor! Everything in the series can not ALL be politics and killings and the Pod scene in episode 3 was hilarious.Many has the Pod scenes as "lows" in their opinion, but that's just the feminist, "men can not do that-attitude", talking.Like Linda in their youtube video, where she praises everything that has to do with the Draenerys scene and criticises Pod. Again.Don't get me wrong, the Daenerys scene was fantastic.Comedy like that is needed througout all the political drama!- vote Pod for Iron Throne

1125	Tyrion4President	2013-04-25	If you recall the scene right before that when Tyrion was talking to LF. LF said that he owed Tyrion something. IMO i think Tyrion already knew those girls would be on the house. He left the money there knowing it would not be accepted. Why would he do this you ask? Because If you also recall Tyrions convo with LF he said he had owed Pod something for saving his life. I think he did it as a confidence booster for Pod and when he came back with the money Tyrion went along with it. We know Pod is a timid guy and this would be the best way to make him feel good about himself

1130	MoA«t	2013-04-25	It was funny as hell so I don't really care, as long as it keeps going.Why build the character now with a silly whore joke when they have plenty of opportunity to do it when he travels with Brienne later on?Because whores travel, and talk. Pod will become the Legendary Cockmaster of Westeros, and his name will be legend by the time he and Brienne hit the road. They'll be given free lodging in exchange for Pod's services.

1131	Lady Lu	2013-04-25	I have no problem with levity, but I really donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t understand why they went in this direction. In AFFC, Jamie helps his young bumbling squire, Peck, lose his virginity to Pia. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s actually an elegant counterpoint to the Jamie-Brienne storyline, showing the effect of the war on women who do not have the promise of an important house to ransom their honor or a knight in white armor to rescue them, and it also illustrates Jamieâ<U+0080><U+0099>s evolution into someone considerate of smallfolk. I would imagine the basic details are too similar, however, to the new â<U+0080><U+009C>Tyrion helps his young bumbling squire, Pod, lose his virginityâ<U+0080><U+009D> storyline to warrant airtime, and I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t believe (to the extent that I had to register on this site to share my disbelief! Lol) HBO would give up such a great scene for a joke about sexual prowess.
Also, a personal request from a Tyrion fan: Whores are a central component of Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s relationship with practically everyone.  Obviously thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Tywin. Then thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Jamie and his whole, â<U+0080><U+009C>Oh sorry I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t tell you your wifeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a whore I hiredâ<U+0080><U+009D>/ â<U+0080><U+009C>Actually Dad made me said that, she wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a whore, sorry â<U+0080>bout that.â<U+0080><U+009D> Tyrion made his infamous threat to Cersei  when she seized the woman she thought was his whore, â<U+0080><U+009C>A day will come when you think yourself safe and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouthâ<U+0080>¦â<U+0080><U+009D> Shae WAS a whore, and even Sansa was why the gods made whores for imps like him. The man saved Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing, and what do people remember about his tenure as Hand? The dwarfâ<U+0080><U+0099>s penny.  So FFS canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t we have ONE person whose relationship with Tyrion isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t defined by whores????
1132	Currawong	2013-04-25	I think you've got it all wrong!   It's not just normal comedy in the show, but actually a giant joke at LF's expense because poor Pod was nervous and quite terrible.  When Tyrion arrranged the visit, the girls expected this from nervous first-time kid, so they got together and decided they would have their own joke at the expense of their boss LF (and Tyrion), so they would reassure Pod about his performance, send the money back and put out the story that Pod was Totally Awesome  /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />	 Ros is part of it of course!

1134	Head of The Ned	2013-04-26	Maybe he bangs Lady Stoneheart in the show? You know, during that scene in AFFC where he, Hyle and Brienne are all brought before her?

1135	Greywolf2375	2013-04-26	Shae WAS a whoretangent...this is the mistake Tyrion makes as well.  Shae IS a whore.  She did not stop being once just because she was brought to Kings Landing.
1136	lostinasia	2013-04-26	I don't think it is l worth looking to deep into this, the scenes with Pod are purely there for TV viewers so they don't forget him when he meets up with Brienne in Season 5 or so.And that is probably a darn good idea. Until reading this thread, I had completely forgotten that the same character had both saved Tyrion's life at the Blackwater and then travelled with Brienne. I'm not sure if I even knew that when I was reading the book. So heck, make him more memorable.Of course, when the RW happened in the books, I also realized I hadn't been paying enough attention to this Bolton fellow. I almost wish the books would come with footnotes: "Pay attention! The third character in this list of 12 minor bannermen will play a key role in Book 6!" At least I read the books on a Kindle and can easily search for names.

1138	mykelsss	2013-04-26	I think this scene got past 95% of watchers.
Tyrion paid off the whores ahead of time and told them to not accept Pod's money, to make him think he was amazing in the sack. He comes back and Bronn/Tyrion feign amazement. It's a confidence booster for a quiet kid.
This has been going on since time immemorable in real-life. It was a common, good-hearted trick (in times when there were women of pleasure).

1139	juanml82	2013-04-26	Wouldn't Ros know about it, though? And she really has no reason to hide it from Varys
1140	BWP	2013-04-26	But then coming on here I realized it was just a joke.  As a reader, I think I just over analyze things.  This is the show, not the books (which I have to constantly remind myself).  And on the show, there can be throw away scenes, things just for comic relief, etc, whereas in the books almost everything has some sort of underlying message.I'm really baffled by the Podrick-as-sex-god angle. Similar to the substitution of Aurthur Dayne with Barristan in couple of scenes in S1 and 2, perhaps Podrick will function as the Magical-Awesome-Penis stand-in for Tormund Giantsbane. ;-)
1141	WinterWarrior	2013-04-26	I think it was just added to the story to have some lightness and fun. The other stories are so dark....I really think it was time for something fun. If you have not read the books I would think this series would seem like everyone just struggles and injustice is the whole story....the Pod story gives us a smile and a laugh.
And even Roz did not annoy me in this episode as she usually does. Now that she is not a whore she does not annoy me as much.

1142	MoA«t	2013-04-26	It's for the humor! Everything in the series can not ALL be politics and killings and the Pod scene in episode 3 was hilarious.Many has the Pod scenes as "lows" in their opinion, but that's just the feminist, "men can not do that-attitude", talking.Like Linda in their youtube video, where she praises everything that has to do with the Draenerys scene and criticises Pod. Again.Don't get me wrong, the Daenerys scene was fantastic. I just think some women doesn't likes the thought of Pod being a testo-vaginadestroyer... but hey.Comedy like that is needed througout all the political drama!- vote Pod for Iron ThroneAs a woman, I say we need MORE PODRICKS PLEASE. And I hope they run that joke forever, just like I hope Ros outlives everyone.And just for the record: we don't want "testo-vaginaDESTROYERS" (as funny as that sounds), we need talented cocksmen who know how to calibrate themselves in order to rub our G-Spots perfectly. You don't want to destroy that vagina. You want to make it happy so it never wants to stop, and will fuck you until your dick falls off.Men take note: Good sex is hard to come by, many of us enjoy adequate sex, but it's not what we want, or need. Women will crawl over glass for AMAZING sex. That should be your goal.
1143	King Kev.	2013-04-26	He's obviously going to use his skills in bed to work his way up the ranks, and take the Iron Throne.
Or perhaps it's just humor, simple humor.
1144	BlueDragon	2013-04-26	As a woman, I say we need MORE PODRICKS PLEASE. And I hope they run that joke forever, just like I hope Ros outlives everyone.And just for the record: we don't want "testo-vaginaDESTROYERS" (as funny as that sounds), we need talented cocksmen who know how to calibrate themselves in order to rub our G-Spots perfectly.

Still waters run deep.  Now he is not only a hero twice over, he is a stud. Yes, it was done for a laugh, but it also demonstrates that Pod is one of the very few characters, maybe the only one who is, as yet, unspoiled from a moral point of  view.  He naturally cares about others.  He never judges Tyrion, preferring to be loyal.And my radar tells me that Pod is the real thing in the sense that he has the attributes of sort of guy who is that good .  Actually, adequate sex is hardly worth the time and trouble. It is always the quiet ones girls.  Well, not always, but if you want to take a risk, bet on one of them. Take it from some one who knows how to pick them.
1145	SilentSense	2013-04-27	Just humour. Varys and Ros talking about it made for a nice reference to last week's episode and reminded us of that fun scene, but it has no significance.
1146	teemo	2013-04-27	I think it was a poorly written joke that just wasn't funny and has confused some people to the point that they think it has significance plot relevance.  Seriously...I know a couple people who think it was just too "random" to not mean anything in the long run.  Some mindless comic relief can be fun, but this wasn't fun...mostly weird.  My friends got a little kick out of some of it, but they definitely believe it "means something" more than comic relief, because well...it wasn't the most hilarious route for that.  They think there's more to it because "four whores would NEVER band together and agree to turn down money, especially if it's LITTLEFINGER's money."  I can see why some people would think that, especially considering LF was threatening Ros like a psychopath last season for being a buzzkill for customers.  But now he's just "too distracted" to care.  My friend said, "Littlefinger is so clever.  What is his scheme this time?"

1147	hombay	2013-04-27	I may be an 18-year old man, meaning my voice in all of this matters little. But I thought it was hilarious comic relief, and that's it.
1148	Dolorous Jim	2013-04-27	I do think it was just a joke, but I think they decided to mention it again to clarify it was a joke. Obviously a lot of people would be thinking he must have said something, but with both Ros and Varys, both spys that would set something like this up, saying it was just him being that good it suggests they knew over analysis would come into play
1149	jons nissa	2013-04-27	Some scenes are built simply for comic relief or to provide a little more exposure for a character who hasn't been given much to that point and there is no greater meaning intended.  This is clearly one of them.  No need to overanalyze...i agree! it was meant to be funny, simple as that. although i like the poster who said that rumors of his "powers" would save him later in the story:Maybe the tale of Podrick The Stud Payne will spread across the 7 kingdoms and when he travels with Brienne there will be a moment like:Random Brothelworker(RBW) heres Podrick's name.-RBW: "Are you the Podrick Payne?"-Pod: looks to the ground "Y... Y... Yes."RBW drags Pod into a room
1150	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-04-27	I thought it was comical. Nothing more.
1151	Runaway Penguin	2013-04-27	It's a prelude to the creation of a new Crown office after Dany Stormborn First of her Name takes throne. Same way Ser Ilyn Payne was King's Justice, Ser Podrick Payne will be Queen's Stud.
1152	bobbybuilderton	2013-04-27	I think Pod was shy and they thought he was cute so they agreed to lie for him. 
Littlefinger not noticing missing money? Please. This is a man who implies that horrible things were done to a woman who he paid a lot of money for but wasn't making him any.
It's to make his search for Tyrion after Joffrey's wedding more believable. He did this because he wanted to impress Tyrion. He looks up to him. He was  hurt when Tyrion just left him. By revealing that it was a lie before Tyrion leaves, it makes it more believable that he would go looking for him. He has proved in the past that he cares what Tyrion thinks of him and has a bond with him even though everyone else hates him.
We'll have him saving Tyrion at Blackwater, lying to impress Tyrion, and trying to impress Tyrion by knowing all the sigils when Dorne comes to visit. That should be enough for the non book readers to believe that he would care that Tyrion left without him.
1153	Lady Arwen	2013-04-27	I don't know about this Podrick business. Pod is quite a peripheral character, and it's a bit silly to waste time on establishing his sexual prowess when there are more important plots to develop (hello, Riverrun?). I really do think it's just an excuse to make sure the whores stay abreast (har, har) with the plot as it moves forward. It's a prelude to the creation of a new Crown office after Dany Stormborn First of her Name takes throne. Same way Ser Ilyn Payne was King's Justice, Ser Podrick Payne will be Queen's Stud. /lmao.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lmao:' />
1154	Israel	2013-04-28	Honestly its not a Joke , GRRM created this character that kind of gets us rooting for him in so many ways.  He's johnny on the spot for tyrion, and Brienne , he killed a knight of the kingsguard, his "ser , my lady's" are hillariously cute for lack of a different word.  Hes apparently an awesome squire also.  I mean GRRM is already building Pod up to be "the man". 
If it is a joke the joke is they had to sex him up for TV viewers to get that sense of how awesome he is.  Its either this or D&D just rewarding multitude of readers thatlove Pod.
1155	Tirilei	2013-04-28	I thought maybe there is something spiritual about him. The show includes elements of religion and magic, so maybe he descends from someone with magical powers and doesn't really know or control it yet, but the women who touched him noticed there is something different about him.
1156	heathers	2013-04-28	If this scence is significant I think it is linked to the fact that this is how Tyrion was repaying his debt to Pod. Now he still owes him for saving his life.
I also think it starts to put the idea in viewers minds that while Tyrion seems like an excellent player he can very easily be used as a pawn too. Whether someone else paid the whores, LF refused the money to play tyrion or the whores did decide Pod was amazing in bed/respectful doesn't seem too important. Pod was happy, became memorable and tyrion is left bewildered.
Tyrion's status as a Lannister does not make him immune to the games played at court....as we are soon to find out. Daddy's money is not always sufficient to get him out the crap...especially if daddy is the one playing games. Tyrion's shock, if real, really should awaken him/viewers to the fact that Shae is a whore and whores go where the money is.

1157	Dragon greyscale	2013-04-28	The key thing about Pod is that he's an unlikely hero...emphasis on unlikely. D&D took that simple fact and focused on sexual prowess instead of skills in battle. The gist is still there and they probably hoped to add some comic relief along the way. 
I think it works. A bit random perhaps, but I can see what they were thinking.
1158	Hellauthere	2013-05-05	As a woman, I say we need MORE PODRICKS PLEASE.

1160	caliquenor	2013-05-08	Book readers know that Pod goes searching for Tyrion when he flees KL, but in the books the reason for this is quite vague. It could be that he feels abandoned by Tyrion after saving his life and he wants some explanations or maybe even revenge, but it is also hinted (or one could think) that he actually feels something for him. Maybe this Pod macho joke tries to rule out that second option, and focuses more on the 'Tyrion, I will find you and I will want some good answers' motivation. Anyway, even if it is only for the sake of comedy, I like it, it seems D&D try lo lighten up the show a little with these 3 (Bronn, Pod and Tyrion).
1161	Gendels Children	2013-05-11	Some scenes are built simply for comic relief or to provide a little more exposure for a character who hasn't been given much to that point and there is no greater meaning intended.  This is clearly one of them.  No need to overanalyze... agreed, I think we are reading to much in to the TV show as if we would with GRRMs writing, it was a cheap attempt at comic relief, IMO the time could have been put to much better use but what ever, it is what it is, it happened so I guess there is nothing let to do but laugh about it
1162	MickT	2014-07-16	As I am hoping he is the son of Robert and Cersei I am hoping it is showing some resemblance to his fathers greatness between the sheets as they have shown him to be clear headed in battle and not so much at other times.... Pretty sure that's how Tyrian describes him at one point .
1163	aedalia	2013-04-24	I think this episode cemented how clever TV Margaery is. She understands Joff so well and has him completely wrapped around her little finger (as it were). And incredible respect for the quailty of acting Natalie Dormer has brought to the role- the look she shot Cersi before walking out with Joff spoke volumes.
I think it's a great change from the books. Before she just seemed like a pawn, ot even worse, a literary device to link the Tyrells to the Lannisters; in the show, she's willful and completely part of the plan.
It of course, makes me wonder what they're going to have happen to her in order to change their minds to make the PW happen.
Any thoughts?
1164	Ran	2013-04-24	Margaery's pretty clever in the novels. It's just not so obvious because we don't have a camera on her without an outside POV.I find the TV show character feels too much like Anne Boelyn from The Tudors. Which is not surprising, but not exactly desirable.
1165	Toxspecific	2013-04-24	TV Margaery. Very attractive, nails the 'outwardly nice girl with a tint of slyness' that Book Margaery has. I enjoy her scenes.

1167	Lord Hogimus	2013-04-24	I never felt we got a good feel for Margery in the books because there are no POV chapters.  We have either Sansa's or Cersi's skewed perspective on her.
Love the character on TV and Dormer is playing it very well.
1168	Ser Dermett Corbray	2013-04-24	I find the TV show character feels too much like Anne Boelyn from The Tudors. Which is not surprising, but not exactly desirable.I feel the same.Also getting a Kate Middleton vibe from her performance too. That might be a bit of a random observation, though.She's just as conniving as Dormer Boleyn but they've tried to take her somewhere different with the whole Princess of the People thing, like with the talking to the orphans and waving to the crowds. Need more of that. The flowers and sunshine aspect of the character.
1169	King of the Road	2013-04-24	TV Margaery wins any day of the week. Natalie Dormer has been one of the standouts so far this season, her and Diana Rigg actually make me look forward to seeing the Tyrells!
1170	TheDarkOne	2013-04-24	She portrays a girl impossible not to fall in love with very well. I certainly fancy her.
1171	Ser Luke.	2013-04-24	This is one of the few characters I actually prefer in the show than to the book, I think Dormer's doing great!
1172	Broken Fox	2013-04-24	She's one of the characters that I like better in the show. Never payed much attention to her in the books. Love how she's playing Joffrey.

I've seen that theory thrown around ... maybe poisoning Joff was just a happy accident (if it was the pie that was poisoned, and not the wine).
1174	ugashep	2013-04-24	I think Margaery was portrayed as clever in the books. She is just younger. She is also not POV in the books so you don't get inside her head but I definately got the impression in the books that she could handle herself, and that she was the protege of the queen of thorns. I think the show is pretty consistent with that. Natalie Dormer is very magnetic in her portrayal to, hottest girl on the show to me, but I'm in my 30's and I can dig her a lot easier than some of the younger girls.

Mags was pretty obviously a clever girl who knew her way around the Game in the books, too. She was pretty Anne Boleyn-like too - wasn't she originally being groomed to seduce King Robert, or something like that?Her being a touch older is going to make the Tommen stuff even more awkward, though. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />

1176	Queen Regent	2013-04-24	I agree, I think Natalie Dormer is so great!  I love the show Margaery much more that the book one.  And when she shot Cersei that look and the crowd was cheering for her (then Jeoff) I couldn't help but thing about Cercei's prophecy, I think Margeary is the girl the lady was talking about.
1177	King Tommen	2013-04-24	Margaery's pretty clever in the novels. It's just not so obvious because we don't have a camera on her without an outside POV.I find the TV show character feels too much like Anne Boelyn from The Tudors. Which is not surprising, but not exactly desirable.I've seen in your reviews you've also singled out Dormer and her portrayal of Margaery as something you're not a fan of.  Would you care to elaborate more on that as I find it a little odd given that the overall consensus from most fans and critics is that both the performance and the characterization is something that has been very well done.
1178	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-24	Margaery is awesome in the show. I don't think it's her fault she has similar traits in The Tudors. Plus, Ann Boleyn was manipulative and sly, but she didn't keep Henry whipped for long. Her character could not adapt to that and had problems controlling her temper--season 2 was a downward spiral. Margaery's more of a schemer. She doesn't just string Joffrey along and make him crazy about her, she makes him outright behave. Granted, if events turned out differently, Margaery could have lost control of Joff, but she's not just pulling the "keep him wanting more" card. Also, I think Dormer strikes a great balance between manipulativeness and kindness. You know she's calculating and always choosing the best tool for the job, but she comes across as so nice. It's great how she can go between them.

1180	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-24	I LOVE show Marg. Margaey was always smart in the novels too, she's just more mysterious, in the background, and we get others' opinions of her. 
I love Dormer Marg, such a total babe!
1181	KoishNoish	2013-04-24	In the books I always took Margaery to be a clever figure playing a very subtle game but personally I prefer the TV version. Dormer is doing so well at portraying this character and the rivalry between her and Cersei is certainly mounting.
1182	Frey Pie a la Mode	2013-04-24	The fleshing out, so to speak, of Margaery has been one of the best things about this season, IMO. I was not pleased when I first read that Natalie Dormer had been cast, because she is just so much older, but they've made it work (and they aged up all the other teens anyway). It makes so much sense to have a Marg who is this adept at manipulation. As others have mentioned, we only saw her in the books through the lens of others' perspective, so she wasn't as fully realized as a character.
Dormer is glowingly beautiful (even if she dresses like a harlot /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />) and is living and breathing the role.
1183	Ran	2013-04-24	I've seen in your reviews you've also singled out Dormer and her portrayal of Margaery as something you're not a fan of.Much as I said earlier, they've basically given her the role of Anne Boleyn from The Tudors and transplanted it to Westeros. It's unfortunate, but the similarities make it all rather boring. I'm sure she's a fine actress, but based on these two roles alone, I'd think she has a limited range and the writers are just writing to that. That bothers me, since it doesn't really do her a service, and given the tawdriness and shallowness of The Tudors, I don't think it's something they want to bring to mind.I also, I admit, find quite a lot of dissonance between her age and her role, and the way she interacts with Sansa. The "porridge plague" scene, for example, would have worked much better with an actor nearer to Sophie Turner's age.I keep wondering how a different Tudors actress -- Sarah Bolger, who did such a fine job as Princess Mary -- might have done in the role. She could play it pretty much the same as Dormer does, but without the mannerisms that recall Dormer's Anne Boleyn. It would have been interesting to see.

1184	Mulled Wino	2013-04-24	I alwas felt like we should have more info on margery.  D&D have flushed out her character well and it translates to the screen.
It'd be impossible to have a woman that will marry 3 kings on tv without the audience understanding why, which doesnt come across in the books.  Her appeal didnt translate other than bringing highgarden.  
Now as to the actress, she's ok, but like ran, i feel like she always plays the same character.
1185	teemo	2013-04-24	In the minority, but definitely prefer book Margaery.  If I want to see Anne Boeyln I can watch Tudors.  I like the subtlety book Marg has.  And yeah, Dormer is too old for Margaery.  She looks young for age, but carries herself in a way that it's obvious she is 30+ and it doesn't mix well with Sansa.  She's also not that terrific of an actress based on what I've seen in these two roles.  She's exactly the same in both.

I never watched The Tudors (because I was told it sucked) so I guess I'm not carrying that baggage into watching her performance on this show.  I also think that while Dormer is 30, she looks much younger and I think she's supposed to be playing a character in their early 20's on the show (which she can pull off).  So the age difference with Sansa, for example doesn't appear as pronounced to me.
1187	go joff go	2013-04-24	I don't even think she is playing it any different then book margaery.  If season 2 threesome scene and I want to be the queen scene doesn't happen, we would all be saying how sweet Margaery is.  I think its just an awesome portrayal.  I agree with the notion that she is having the same eyeopening portrayal that alfie gave to Theon last year.
1188	teemo	2013-04-24	They lucked out that Sophie is really starting to look old for her age, but there is still almost a 15 year age difference.  It's never going to mesh with me because I always imagine Margaery as a girl just about a year older than Sansa.
1189	Mulled Wino	2013-04-24	I don't even think she is playing it any different then book margaery.  If season 2 threesome scene and I want to be the queen scene doesn't happen, we would all be saying how sweet Margaery is.  I think its just an awesome portrayal.  I agree with the notion that she is having the same eyeopening portrayal that alfie gave to Theon last year.Dormer as good as Alfie as Theon?????  Wow.  I wouldnt say the Dormer is anywhere near the top 5 actors in the series.  Alfie is.  Margery really isnt that tough a role.  Be nice, sly looks... Look a little wiser than much younger people..
1190	dttljs123	2013-04-24	My concern with Margaery is whether or not she knows Joffrey will die during the PW, the Queen of Thornes was told the awfulness of Joffrey but will she extend her plans to end his life w/ her granddaughter? I wonder this. Often, in public places.
1191	King Tommen	2013-04-24	My concern with Margaery is whether or not she knows Joffrey will die during the PW, the Queen of Thornes was told the awfulness of Joffrey but will she extend her plans to end his life w/ her granddaughter? I wonder this. Often, in public places.My assumption when reading the books was that Margaery was aware of the plot but was not an active participant in its execution.  She'd have to be pretty dumb (and that's not a characteristic that would be consistent on the show or the books) to be unaware that Joffrey's death was probably orchestrated in part by her awesome, scheming grandmother.
1192	Sweet-N-SourRobin	2013-04-24	TV Margaery is what I always imagined Book Margaery should be and was supposed to be, only more obviously so because we see her more.
That, if GRRM were doing all over again, this is how he'd do it.  Starting earlier and making it more obvious/on camera (and Margaery is a presence and has more agency at an earlier narrative point in the show than she does in the books).
She's everything I've wanted the character to be.  Dormer turning in such a quality performance certainly doesn't hurt matters (two episodes in and I was already calling for them to just concede the Emmy to her Right Now).
It is as if my headcanon has become actual canon.  You can imagine how pleased that makes me /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

1193	boojam	2013-04-24	I find the TV show character feels too much like Anne Boelyn from The Tudors. Which is not surprising, but not exactly desirable.This is an itch that won't go away, is it?I don't see why since Natalie Dormer played Anne Boelyn this comparison keeps coming up.Almost guilt by association?Dave and Dan have decided to put the Tyrells (at least two of them) more explicitly in the game, playing  Machiavellian pieces. George had them there but a not as out front.Well I do like the new Margaery and Lady Olenna engaging in the game on stage more that as in the books.I saw The Tutors, didn't like it, but no, personal opinion,  Natalie Dormer's Margaery does not remind me of Anne Boelyn.Once again what D and D have written has been done.... I hope this argument will go away.

1194	dtones520	2013-04-24	What if the PW was actually an attempt to poison Tyrion to get Sansa away from him and marry her to a Tyrell? I've seen that theory thrown around ... maybe poisoning Joff was just a happy accident (if it was the pie that was poisoned, and not the wine).I thought it was pretty clear that the wine was what was poisoned based on its color.

1196	DemiNymph	2013-04-24	I did not watch the Tudors, so f that.
TV Marge delights me. She is so skilled at manipulating Joff, I just love her. I don't know who the actress is, but I did not need convincing that TV Marge is only 20 years old or so, maybe even 19.
1197	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-24	I guess I'm glad I never saw The Tudors. That being said I think Dormer is doing a fantastic job. She doesn't seem more than 5 years or 6 older than Sansa, which is fine for me since she's shown to be much stronger and less naive than teenage Sansa. 
Although it will be a little funny to see her supposedly having to marry Tommen.

Robert De Niro often plays gangsters, doesn't mean that he isn't brilliant in the Untouchables, Casino, Goodfellas and once Upon a Time in America. If anything, it just means that she has more experience. Also, its not like there is much to Margaery in the books.

I'm not a fan of tyrell or marg but I prefer the subtlety of book marg because you never get first hand view of what she's really like. I don't like how obvious it is to viewers that she's playing them but the ones being played are oblivious feels too much like soap tv when they stare at the screen. And I find Dormer as a Rachel character.

1200	MarieAntoinette	2013-04-25	I like TV Margaery and the actress portraying her a lot. I think it was a good choice to make her a more prominent character, because this will make her future storyline (the arrest, Cersei accusing her) much more interesting. TV Margaery makes me wonder whether she really is the younger queen that will cast Cersei down. Maybe that is why they are fleshing her character out more on the show. The only thing I have in mind is that I hope she does not take away too much screentime from other characters. Maybe I'm wrong but I feel she has already gotten quite a lot of screentime in S3, I think it is time to focus on some other characters more now, since I asumme and hope that the PW will not be in S3.

1201	David of Kent	2013-04-25	The only part I disagreed with is the statement that she felt like a pawn in the books.  I never felt that.  Just felt she was potentially a clever player that was being guided well by the Queen of Thorns in how to play the game to advance her family
1202	TheDarkOne	2013-04-25	I wouldn't be surprised if the love story between her and Joff becomes the favorite story line for most next season. I agree with other comments here, they have real chemsitry and it's always a treat to see them on screen together.
1203	Ran	2013-04-25	Robert De Niro often plays gangsters, doesn't mean that he isn't brilliant in the Untouchables, Casino, Goodfellas and once Upon a Time in America.Yeah, but each and every one of those roles, he was playing a different character. Similar occupations, perhaps, similar themes to the work... but different people.  I mean, there's a pretty massive difference between Jimmy Conway and Noodles... But also, you know, Dormer is no De Niro. Maybe if she were, the fact that she brings so much of the same energy to this role as she did to Anne Boleyn would be acceptable to me. It's not.I think they are pretty blatantly trying to play down Dormers age by like 10 years or so. She doesn't look much older than Sophie by any means.Well, mileage varies. To me, but she doesn't look younger than Finn Jones, even, much less anywhere in the vicinity of Sophie Turner. Dormer has that sort of face, I think. She'll look perpetually 30 years old until she's approaching 50, I reckon. Sort of the female Jon Hamm, who says he's looked 35 since he was 21 (and still does).Also, its not like there is much to Margaery in the books.They take what's there and they've used it to some degree. The complaint isn't that they've added stuff, however. This is in theory fine. The problem is that I keep seeing Anne Boleyn every time we're supposed to be seeing Margaery. Sexually experienced noble woman tasked with seducing and controlling a king, with ambitions for her family and for herself, is in essence the exact same role. The only thing notably diffferent with her at this stage is that the king she's seducing isn't married to another woman, and that she seems to care more about the plight of the poor. Perhaps if they make more of that latter, she'll start to distinguish herself.
1204	Ravi Seaworth	2013-04-25	So, why should we, the majority, who haven't watched the Tudors, care about this "problem"? This is a TV Show, with a huge number of characters. We are not focusing on a handful of them, but tens of people with important roles. It would be too much to ask for multidimensional characters. It makes perfect sense to focus only on the main traits of each character that are essential to the plot and develop them in the best possible way. Of course, some characters were not accurately portrayed, but Margaery is certainly not one of them. I'm not talking about that specific dialogue she didn't have, but about her overall attitude. I think many book readers follow a bottom-up approach of starting from the books and then analyzing the show in terms of the exact changes made to the narrative. In my opinion, we should follow a top-down, of focusing only on the main events of the story and the role of each character in those events. By doing that, I think you reach the conclusion that the show doesn't deviate from the book that much, as some people claim it does.
1205	Ran	2013-04-25	So, why should we, the majority, who haven't watched the Tudors, care about this "problem"?You don't have to. I was asked why I don't like her in the role. Is there some crime in my answering someone's questions?
1206	TFP	2013-04-25	I initially didn't like Dormer's age. It detracts a little from the book's cersei-margaery dynamic (or, more accurately, changes it). But to my mind it greatly enhances both the joff-m and sansa-m dynamics. It's almost scary watching trusting Sansa enjoying her friendship with the much older and wiser Margaery. 
This said I think that an actress up to around 5 years younger might have been better. Margaery will be an important character for quite a few years - in say 2016, assuming that the series is still running then, I don't think she'll look quite as good in all those sleeveless dresses...

1207	Lady Sansa Stark	2013-04-25	If they only wanted her to appear as a nice girl, who does all these charitable things and is the Good made flesh, they shouldn't have casted Natalie Dormer. This kinda confirms (TO ME, not necessarily to some of you) that she's just as manipulative and scheming as the rest of her family, which the TVshow portrays quite well. I still don't know whom to root for; Margaery or Cersei. I rooted for Cersei in the books, I believe.

You can clearly see she's supposed to be older than Joffrey. but she doesn't appear to be that much older as she in reality is. Though, her interaction with Tommen... It was kinda creepy already in the books, I don't even want to think how that'll play out on screen.
1209	lannistergold	2013-04-25	In the books, we just get hints at Marg being a canny political player. In the show, it's right up-front. I'm keen to see some more psychological victories over Joffrey,

Why do you need more appeal that an alliance with the most powerful house, and the second richest?That's how marriages worked back in medieval times. It didn't matter whether the wife was beautiful, charming, clever or whatever. The lands, gold and swords that she brings with her is the significant factor. The books manage to get this point accros quite well: Renly didn't mind that she was a woman, Joffrey didn't mind that she may not be a virgin, and Tommen didn't mind the huge age difference. It was just a convenient, necessary match.Somehow, I strongly dislike the idea of needing to make the character a manipulating ambitious clever girl in order to justify her marrying three kings. As if they were attracted to herself instead of her father's titles. That's a stereotypical Hollywood story, not the books I'm a fan of.

Many, if not most of the time, marriage didn't even bring lands, gold or swords .... but it did buy political influence and defused a potential enemy. I particularly think of the powerful patrician family's of the Roman Empire.One thing about Westeros and seemingly Essos , it's solid patriarchal. Are there any Queens (outside of Dany) who sit the throne anywhere in Martin World? I can't remember , but I don't think a sole queen has sat the Iron Throne?It was rare in Europe, Elisabeth I was a true anomaly (in fact maybe the most politically clever monarch to sit the English throne). Historians think she never married since that would have demoted her to 'Queen'!The number of sole ruler queens in history is rare. Catherine de Medici during the time she was queen regent was essentially the only sole female monarch France ever had until her sons pushed her aside. Catherine the Great is another anomaly.(I suppose one could count Victoria and Elisabeth II, but their political position were different.)I can't remember other European sole ruler queens, even tho there were some. Anyway if Dany succeeds in taking the Iron Throne wouldn't she be the first sole female ruler of Westeros , ever?Of course in my imagination it is one of frozen shambling hamburgers from the North squatting there!

1215	The hairy bear	2013-04-25	Wasnt there a big hoopla in the books regarding whether or not Margery was still a V? Not just with Joff but the faith and cersei?But those rumours only surfaced when House Lannister wasn't in control. No one dared to defy a Lannister-Tyrell united alliance. Precisely, when they were in power, it didn't really matter whether Margaery was virgin. She assured she was, that was enough for anyone concerned.It wasn't a match between Margaery and Joffrey/Tommen. It was a match between Mace and Tywin. Margaery could have been an ignorant illiterate with no brains and she would have married three kings all the same.
1216	SeanF	2013-04-25	Margaery in the books is studious, cunning, and ruthless, and very much her grandmother-in-training.  We don't get any sense of her using sexual allure to manipulate either Joffrey and Tommen.
In the TV series, both Joffrey and Margaery are aged up.  As neither is a POV in the books,they need to have scenes created for them.  Margaery is clearly sexually experienced, and is able to manipulate Joffrey accordingly, and her ambition is made very obvious.
1217	Tywin's bastard	2013-04-25	Much as I said earlier, they've basically given her the role of Anne Boleyn from The Tudors and transplanted it to Westeros. It's unfortunate, but the similarities make it all rather boring. I'm sure she's a fine actress, but based on these two roles alone, I'd think she has a limited range and the writers are just writing to that. That bothers me, since it doesn't really do her a service, and given the tawdriness and shallowness of The Tudors, I don't think it's something they want to bring to mind.I can see how it's a source of annoyance but I feel that it would be clearer if you explained what it is in her previous character that doesn't fit, especially when you put it up in a general analysis that's quite guaranteed to include people that didn't watch The Tudors (I'm one of those myself). I don't really find acting range relevant in itself when analyzing a single role as long as it encompasses the character she's currently playing.That's of course unless the only problem is that she's played a similar role before. As said I can get that, although I also think it falls somewhat on the demands on viewer immersion.
1218	boojam	2013-04-25	It wasn't a match between Margaery and Joffrey/Tommen. It was a match between Mace and Tywin. Margaery could have been an ignorant illiterate with no brains and she would have married three kings all the same.Of course it just mirrors how history of this alternate universe we live in worked, works?In history when it came to political power did not make any difference if she was not a virgin or was a snuggled toothed hag.Usually it was a capable woman who married a blithering idiot, as  Catherine the Great did.
1219	SeanF	2013-04-25	It of course, makes me wonder what they're going to have happen to her in order to change their minds to make the PW happen.Any thoughts?Sansa's already told her and her grandmother that Joffrey's a monster (something which I'm sure they can see for themselves).  I could imagine Joffrey asking her to do something really perverted, like sexually torturing a maidservant, that would act as a trigger for the plot.
1220	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-25	I guess I'm the minority here, but I actually prefer Book!Margaery. I always thought that Margaery was playing the game in the books. But we didn't know how well she could play. We didn't know how much was Cersei's imagination and how much was real. I often found myself questioning her actions. I would ask myself "Why is she riding horses so often and so long?" "Does she really care about Sansa or the orphans?" "Is she really a virgin?" "Is she fucking Loras? I guess Loras had something with Renly, but could it be?" I don't know maybe Cersei's paranoia is contagious, but there was this compelling mistery about Margaery.However, in the show it is too obvious that she is and excellent player. I don't like it. That's something that I don't like about the show, everything is too obvious. I don't find Show Margaery interesting. I think she is too old and that the actress is not as good as everybody thinks. I think the actress is a little bit better when she plays the dark side of Margaery, but I don't buy her "inocent" face (and looking inocent is pretty much what Margaery is about). Also, and this may sound too extreme, but some of her faces annoy me, something that she does with her nose. I've never seen her acting anywhere else. I never watched The Tudors. So I don't know if she would be better playing a different role.
1221	insertname	2013-04-25	TV Margaery, definitely...book Margaery has always been a bit bland to me, very likely because she didn't have her own POV
1222	Warhawk137	2013-04-25	I like TV!Margaery for essentially the same reason I like Talisa, oddly enough.
The problem adapting a book to television or film is that the storytelling mechanism is different.  GRRM, in writing the books, particularly using the rotating POV format, is perfectly able to include characters who, on one hand, are important to the plot, but on the other, still remain in the background and aren't heavily developed, because the plot-important stuff can easily get across via another character POV.
Can't really do that in a medium like television or film.  In this medium, a plot-important character is generally going to need scenes where they take the spotlight to get across that importance, and thus a direct transferral of that character from book to screen isn't going to work.  You just can't get away with putting a character who's basically a blank slate in the books onto the screen as-is.  Obviously the response to the changes in regards to Margaery have been better received, but in regards to Talisa, while I understand why some people just don't care much for her character in general, I have to ask - what was so captivating about Jeyne Westerling that makes the change so undesirable?  There are inanimate objects in the books that get more characterization than Jeyne Westerling.
But I digress.  I like the changes to Margaery, but more than that, I absolutely love how Dormer is pulling off the character as that character has been adapted for television.  She's hit all the right notes, it's the perfect role for her.
1223	Daske	2013-04-25	For me book Marge really wasn't all that interesting at all, a rare time when Martin failed to deliver the goods when fleshing out his characters. There was just nothing to get excited about. But TV Marge grabs my attention ('Oh! What's she up to now!'... 'Ooooh sneaky!') and I disagree with whoever said it doesn't take much skill to play her role - appearing to be plausable to Joffrey or Sansa yet sending out other signals to the viewer - there's quite a bit of subtlety in her performance. She has become one of the highlights of the show this season.
1224	The Monkey	2013-04-25	She fucking brilliant, one of the few characters to be improved upon in the TV show (along with Tywin and Viserys). Her and Tommen together will be the cutest thing ever.
1225	teemo	2013-04-25	I guess I'm the minority here, but I actually prefer Book!Margaery.I always thought that Margaery was playing the game in the books. But we didn't know how well she could play. We didn't know how much was Cersei's imagination and how much was real. I often found myself questioning her actions. I would ask myself "Why is she riding horses so often and so long?" "Does she really care about Sansa or the orphans?" "Is she really a virgin?" "Is she fucking Loras? I guess Loras had something with Renly, but could it be?" I don't know maybe Cersei's paranoia is contagious, but there was this compelling mistery about Margaery.This is exactly how I felt.  One second I thought I had her figured out, the next I wasn't so sure.  That was fun.  If I saw the show first, I'd suspect all that intrigue would be gone.
1226	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-25	Margaery in the books is studious, cunning, and ruthless, and very much her grandmother-in-training.  We don't get any sense of her using sexual allure to manipulate either Joffrey and Tommen.In the TV series, both Joffrey and Margaery are aged up.  As neither is a POV in the books,they need to have scenes created for them.  Margaery is clearly sexually experienced, and is able to manipulate Joffrey accordingly, and her ambition is made very obvious.What's weird is I'm not sure that she's really using sex at all.  It's possible Joffrey is such damaged goods that a sexual woman really doesn't attract him all that much absent some brutality.I think what she's really offering Joffrey is validation and (fake) admiration from an intelligent female.He knows she's smart, she's older, but rather than treating him in that manner that his mother does, she basically affirms how great he is by showing interest in the things in which he is interested.  Sansa just said words to the effect that he was wonderful.  Margaery, however, showed actual interest when his violent, sadistic streak came out as he was describing the crossbow.  It's like he's the psychopath who has found his like-minded partner.Her gender matters, of course, but I think primarily in the sense that he previously had such disdain for women that finding a woman who actually (he thinks) sees the world the way he does is a good fortune he never expected.
1227	shiola	2013-04-25	I love the Tyrells.  I loved them in the books and hated that they aren't PoV characters.  So the fact that the show is handling them so well and is showing them to be as clever as I always assumed they were is wonderful.  More Marg scenes, please.
1228	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-25	What's weird is I'm not sure that she's really using sex at all.  It's possible Joffrey is such damaged goods that a sexual woman really doesn't attract him all that much absent some brutality.I think what she's really offering Joffrey is validation and (fake) admiration from an intelligent female.He knows she's smart, she's older, but rather than treating him in that manner that his mother does, she basically affirms how great he is by showing interest in the things in which he is interested.

Yes, she's an attractive woman, but I felt it was the approval and the false flattery and admiration that Joffrey loves. Especially when he's doing something particularly sadistic, as you've mentioned the crossbow and also his laughing over dead Targs, when Marg laughs too and flatters and admires him, this is what is winning him over.
1229	Dove	2013-04-25	Yeah, her manipulation of Joff is only sexual in the vaguest sense, in a way the whole point is that it isn't sexual and she knows that. The prostitutes last season learned the hard way that that shit don't fly with him. She's picked up on the fact that it wouldn't work on Joffrey at all so she's appealing to other facets of his personality in clever ways, because she knows how to read people and use the knowledge she's learned from others too. Margaery is awesome.I've seen the first two seasons of the Tudors so I get the similarity complaints I guess but sorry, I can't hear y'all over the sounds of my swooning for Natalie Dormer

1230	Dragon greyscale	2013-04-25	TV Marg is way better, simply because she's fleshed out more. Cunning,strategic, and very aware of her feminine power. Kind of like Joan Harris in Mad Men. My colleagues and I were discussing the hot actresses and someone said about Dormer: "she's too feline for me." I think that's spot on in terms of her characterization. A pussycat who wraps men around her fingers with a couple of sensual purrs.
Whether Dormer is a one note actress is a different question. This particular role simply fits like a glove.

1231	Ferrum Aeternum	2013-04-25	Add me to the list of folks who loves show Margaery for all the reasons mentioned.  I wasn't exactly blown away with her in S2 (admittedly she didn't have much to do) but she's been the most pleasant surprise for me of any character thus far this season.
1232	'96Buck	2013-04-25	Cersei's reaction to Margarey is much less paranoid / much more well-founded watching Margarey's TV scenes than what we get to see in the book.  I think I like that better.
1233	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-25	Yeah, it's part of her charm that her sexiness toward Joff doesn't involve sex (despite the crossbow insinuations). She dresses in a way most dudes would drool over, but he becomes more interested in her when she talks to him and shares his interests. What's also interesting is she has him trusting her, like when he followed her out onto the steps of the Sept. For a brief moment he looked totally lost and nervous. It had the secondary effect of proving Margaery knows better than Cersei -- the peasants don't all want to rip his throat out -- so he has even less reason to listen to mommy dearest.Oh, Jack Gleeson comments on the Joff-Marg relationship. He's so adorable.
1234	kingkiller	2013-04-25	To me Natalie Dormer has stolen every scene she's in.  I love her portrayal.  In the books she has a common touch that makes the smallfolk absolutely love her (of course the Tyrells helping to save KL plus all the food they send makes it real easy for them to love her).  This is the one aspect they choose to go back to in the show- she's able to make pretty much everyone like her.
Everyone drools over the QoT's prowess at the Game. Except, for me anyway, she makes it painfully apparent that she is more clever than you are.  The ones to watch out for are the ones who do it behind the scenes.  Margaery has learned from her grandmother but also has the wits to not lord it over people.
Season 1 belonged to Cersei, 2 to Arya, this one goes to Margaery I would say.
1235	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-25	Cersei's reaction to Margarey is much less paranoid / much more well-founded watching Margarey's TV scenes than what we get to see in the book.  I think I like that better.Yess!!!! Me too. Cersei's hatred is very cartoon paranoid, and very inane in the books, in the TV show I'm looking forward to some actual awesome rivalry.
1236	TheDarkOne	2013-04-25	I don't see Joff being manipulated by her, I think they are genuinely falling in love with each other. I hope the show makes a change and bypasses the PW and keeps them together. They have amazing chemistry.
1237	Warhawk137	2013-04-25	I don't see Joff being manipulated by her, I think they are genuinely falling in love with each other. I hope the show makes a change and bypasses the PW and keeps them together. They have amazing chemistry.*falls off chair*NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!  /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />On a more serious note, I see nothing suggesting Margaery is actually falling in love with Joffrey.
1238	Dove	2013-04-25	I don't see Joff being manipulated by her, I think they are genuinely falling in love with each other. I hope the show makes a change and bypasses the PW and keeps them together. They have amazing chemistry.That's an... interesting reading of those scenes. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />The idea of Joffrey somehow surviving is a hilarious mental image though. Wouldn't that just be the best worst brorst troll if Joffrey starts choking at his wedding, only for him to successfully cough it out and for the PW to just proceed like a normal wedding with no death or scandal. Imagine the collective internet meltdowns.

1239	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-25	I don't see Joff being manipulated by her, I think they are genuinely falling in love with each other.What qualities does Joffrey possess that would lead any decent person to fall in love with him?  He's rude, immature, self-centered, and cruel.  Plus, he's much younger than she is.  Perhaps Margaery might aspire to change him into the kind of person she might be able to tolerate, but to this point, he's still the same shit he's always been.  How can anyone fall in love with that?
1240	teemo	2013-04-25	I don't see Joff being manipulated by her, I think they are genuinely falling in love with each other. I hope the show makes a change and bypasses the PW and keeps them together. They have amazing chemistry.sarcasm????
1241	Lady of Long Lake	2013-04-25	This is one of the few characters I actually prefer in the show than to the book, I think Dormer's doing great!Agree. I LOVE this actress and her portrayal. She's going to be Sherlock's love, Irene Adler, in Elementary this season. I'm anxious to see her acting with him.
1242	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-25	The idea of Joffrey somehow surviving is a hilarious mental image though. Wouldn't that just be the best worst brorst troll if Joffrey starts choking at his wedding, only for him to successfully cough it out and for the PW to just proceed like a normal wedding with no death or scandal. Imagine the collective internet meltdowns.Margaery looks away with a "dammit!" look, only to later kiss him with a crossbow during a tragic hunting accident.
1243	shiola	2013-04-25	Oh, Jack Gleeson comments on the Joff-Marg relationship. He's so adorable.Gods, he's so wonderful.  I'll miss him.
1244	Lady Arwen	2013-04-25	Book Marg is definitely more subtly sneaky than TV Marg, who is wonderful but a little obvious in her scheming ways. I suppose it's one of those book-to-screen translation failures. I just felt like GRRM did a better job of making you wonder what the heck Marg would do next in the books.
1245	Dove	2013-04-25	Gods, he's so wonderful.  I'll miss him.Even in a show full of extremely talented child/young adult actors he's still such a standout, and manages to give a completely obnoxious character an enjoyability/doofy charisma that was never there in the books. I'm still really surprised that he's planning on dropping out of the acting biz after this because he seems like a natural.
1246	Joyful Union	2013-04-26	Book Marg is definitely more subtly sneaky than TV Marg, who is wonderful but a little obvious in her scheming ways. I suppose it's one of those book-to-screen translation failures. I just felt like GRRM did a better job of making you wonder what the heck Marg would do next in the books.Well, he's kept us guessing for three books now, and were still no closer to knowing who she really is. She's barely a character at all in the books, more of a plot point. She's so subtle she's practically none-existence. More of a failure by GRRM then anything else.

It's a curse for the book purists ... can't be helped... many of the actors are better book characters than the book characters!(Another curse for the book purists is that just as writers, David Benioff and D. B. Weiss are just as good writers and screenwriters as GRRM. Bringing their own creativity is going to change the narrative. They have already invented Byzantine intrigue at KL that really only hinted at in the books.)

1248	MHaaskivi	2013-04-26	The only part I disagreed with is the statement that she felt like a pawn in the books.  I never felt that.  Just felt she was potentially a clever player that was being guided well by the Queen of Thorns in how to play the game to advance her familyI'd agree with that; I always felt that the Tyrells knew how to play the game as a team better than the Lannisters did, and whatever their differences behind the scenes they stepped into place in public.
1249	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-26	GRRM is an amazing character developer with the POVs. Sansa, Jaime, etc. Uber complex and plenty of subtlety  It's just you can't develop every side character that deeply without getting into their heads. In TV, because you can convey a lot with a visual and don't have POV restrictions, a greater breadth of characters can have more development, but they still won't be as complex as the best-developed book characters.
Take Joffrey for example -- he's a better character in the TV show because the actor has a ton of ability. Sure, he's cruel, just like the book, but Gleeson conveys such a sense of sadism, spiteful fear, and erratic charisma. It's more difficult to show that if the POV is a character who's simply terrified of him. Meanwhile, I love Peter Dinklage to pieces and think he's kicking ass, but Tyrion has more complexity in the book. It would be hard to convey all that onscreen without going into an awkward monologue.

1250	teemo	2013-04-26	Gleeson says he's retiring acting, but he may change his mind when gets a bunch of offers after Joff's death...he's an unusually good actor for a 20 year old.As far as Charles Dance goes, he is perfect as Tywin.  I just wish he didn't smile.  His portrayal doesn't even seem like a guy who would ever smile, but he does it all of the time regardless.

1251	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-26	The thing is though, he's PERFECT for Joffrey, he'd probably get typecast with loads of other roles. I still hold out some hope he might take up theatre /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />
1252	TalalOfDorne	2013-04-26	The thing is though, he's PERFECT for Joffrey, he'd probably get typecast with loads of other roles.

You know the actor is perfect for the role when you hate him as if he really was the character, at least thats how I see it.
1253	wolverine	2013-04-26	Well, he's kept us guessing for three books now, and were still no closer to knowing who she really is. She's barely a character at all in the books, more of a plot point.

1255	Sniraga	2013-04-27	I love the Tyrells.  I loved them in the books and hated that they aren't PoV characters.  So the fact that the show is handling them so well and is showing them to be as clever as I always assumed they were is wonderful.  More Marg scenes, please.I agree! I love seeing the scenes we couldn't in the books due the PoV structure. Sometimes those are sadly cringeworthy (I'm looking at you, Stannis), but with the Tyrells they're doing an excellent job. The KL machinations with Marg/QoT/Joffrey/Sansa/Cersei/Tywin are the best part of GoT right now - along with Dany's storyline (Dracarys!)
1256	boojam	2013-04-27	I think you are nuts.  His characterization is some of the best.You are right Charles Dance's interpretation of the Tywin is the best in the show.
1257	jons nissa	2013-04-27	book margaery seemed more innocent though and it was easy to see her going to the sept and praying piously. it's easier to imagine her being innocent of the charges cersei trumps up against her. but i love show margaery. the extra scheming and planning she does makes her seem more alive than in the book. show margeary also gives her actions a more modern context. in the book, she seems like the ultimate dutiful daughter, going from husband to husband. but on the show, it is her personal ambition as well as the family goals that motivates her willingness to remarry so many times. 
natalie dormer and charles dance are doing wonders with their characters on the show. gleeson too although i don't think he will be tempted to do anymore acting. he's in an extremely prestigious academic program and that seems to be where his heart is. still, his "joffrey" is fabulous.
1258	Starks Among Us	2013-10-17	I always wondered if book Marg was as sly as she seemed to be, if she knew what she was doing and was playing the game, or if she was just truly sweet and simple. I like show Marg because it confirms to me that she does know what she's doing and she's actively playing the game.
1259	moonspinner	2014-02-28	Well I liked the ambiguity - that we don't know. Pycelle said she asked him to brew moon tea for her. That made me go "mmmm...." And the Kettleback guy said that she wasn't above flirting with him - just that she was too smart to cross any lines. She carries a bouquet to Tywin's funeral, but keeps Â a single rose to "filter" out the odors - it's a pretty clever thing to do without causing offense.Â

Yes, I think this would be a wonderful change. *lololol*
1260	belladeuil	2014-04-17	I prefer the Margaery Tyrell in the books.
1261	Nagisa Furukawa	2013-04-22	Seemed one of the more Varys centric episodes of the series so far. We got two backstory monologues, one about his castration, the other about growing up a thief, and later met with the Queen of Thorns.
Also, controversially I will imagine, we got a reveal that Varys keeps the sorcerer who castrated him ritualistically in a small box in his room. That was... pretty unexpected. There's been a lot of theories over the years about "Is Varys possibly not even a eunuch? Maybe his whole backstory is bunk and something else is going on (IE, Blackfyres)?" so this would appear to make it pretty concrete... then again, all we saw was a shivered old man with his mouth gagged; it doesn't have to be who Varys said he was.
Nevertheless, I thought Conleth Hill (one of my favorite actors on the show) continued to do fine work.
1262	Delmas	2013-04-22	I took the scene as he was unpacking the box for the first time, meaning it just arrived.
What Varys is going to do with the sorcerer and why he is even in the show is yet to be seen.
1263	Delmas	2013-04-22	also it was made clear, in the show at least, that his junk is gone.  There was a scene were Ros grabbed for it and was suprised by what she felt
1264	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-22	I took the scene as he was unpacking the box for the first time, meaning it just arrived.What Varys is going to do with the sorcerer and why he is even in the show is yet to be seen.I figured it was just a one off character appearance to prove what varys was saying. iirc right before that he was talking of being pateint, and then he opens up the box to see that his pateince paid off, and he opened it in front of tyrion while tyrion was wanting revenge of his own.
1265	Rhasgul	2013-04-22	Same here, I don't think he'll be a recurring character. Maybe just one more time to show how scheming and cruel Varys can actually be, but he won't play any serious part in the story.
Same for me, I'm pretty sure he just arrived in King's Landing, as Varys makes it clear that it is up to that moment that he has been spreading his birdies and power throughout the world so far that they can even reach the sorcerer. Tyrion happened to walk in then (could be that Varys knew and planned it) and Varys was sure it would create a nice opportunity show his cunning to Tyrion so that Tyrion would place his trust in him for future plans.
1266	Mediumjon Umber	2013-04-22	After this episode I'm a little more convinced that Varys might be related to the Targaryens. The sorcerer throwing his manhood on the brazier to complete his spell sounds a lot like what a red priest would do if he had some blood of a king.
1267	Kernest	2013-04-22	Same for me, I'm pretty sure he just arrived in King's Landing, as Varys makes it clear that it is up to that moment that he has been spreading his birdies and power throughout the world so far that they can even reach the sorcerer. Tyrion happened to walk in then (could be that Varys knew and planned it) and Varys was sure it would create a nice opportunity show his cunning to Tyrion so that Tyrion would place his trust in him for future plans.Yeah, he could have easily have gotten the information from one of his birdies that Tyrion was heading his way, and then just picked up the crowbar. Seems mighty coincidental that it would have just happened, but you could say that it was for storytelling purposes as well.
1268	StarkTagaryen	2013-04-22	the beginning scene with tyrion and varys was great /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />After this episode I'm a little more convinced that Varys might be related to the Targaryens. The sorcerer throwing his manhood on the brazier to complete his spell sounds a lot like what a red priest would do if he had some blood of a king.that's an interesting point which would make sense later when he helps tyrion escape
1269	Ser Drizztos	2013-04-22	Didn't he already tell Tyrion his story about the cutting in a previous episode? When they were preparing for the Blackwater battle, I seem to remember.
1270	Hotpie4theironthrone	2013-04-22	I thought the fact that he keeps the guy locked up was interesting
A lot of book readers seem to think that the story he tells Tyrion of his castration is one of the only things he says that we can categorically believe
I think that keeping the guy locked up supports this
1271	MyLittleDirewolf	2013-04-22	After this episode I'm a little more convinced that Varys might be related to the Targaryens. The sorcerer throwing his manhood on the brazier to complete his spell sounds a lot like what a red priest would do if he had some blood of a king.Same here. I'm totally convinced that Varys is at least a Blackfyre, and I think that part of the story was deliberately dropped in as a clue to show-only watchers. We had Mel talking about needing the blood of a kind in the previous ep, and now Varys tells the story of having his stuff cut off and thrown in the flames.I feel the sorcerer in the box was to illustrate that 1) Varys plays the long game, he was patient and finally has his revenge, and 2) that he can be cruel. I think the box had just arrived, but he really didn't *need* to open in it in front of Tyrion, but he did for effect.
1272	Harrad	2013-04-22	Didn't he already tell Tyrion his story about the cutting in a previous episode? When they were preparing for the Blackwater battle, I seem to remember.He was cut off...er...interrupted

1273	TheDarkOne	2013-04-22	After this episode I'm a little more convinced that Varys might be related to the Targaryens. The sorcerer throwing his manhood on the brazier to complete his spell sounds a lot like what a red priest would do if he had some blood of a king.It also sounds exactly like what the Unsullied do miuns the chit chat about the voice.Regardless, liek all things this season, we have themes. Jamie, Theon, Varys, Bran etc. are all people who have experienced physical loss and thus the character study of how each one reacts. Theon is regret, Jamie is self pity, Vary's revenge, etc.Int he world of TV, especially HBO, it's common to introduce a theme each season and then have each character react in a way that helps flesh out their character. Betrayl is another motif this season.
1274	Longspear Ryk	2013-04-22	Wasnt that Pyat Pree's burnt ass in that box?
1275	Lord Martin	2013-04-22	So does this debunk any theories that it was Marwyn who cut off Vary's manhood?
1276	Crown	2013-04-22	I just want to say Conleth Hill was amazing, as always. I love his work, and I hope they keep him on the show when he's off-screen in the books (Feast & Dance).
1277	Frey Pie a la Mode	2013-04-22	Great scene, and I agree the box had just arrived and was opened in front of Tyrion to make a point.
But ewww, wouldn't Tyrion have noticed the box smelled really, really badly and asked, "What the hell is in that anyway???" right off the bat? Sorcerer friend had come a long way, and there were air holes to let out his scent.
1278	A Real Dire Wolf	2013-04-22	then again, all we saw was a shivered old man with his mouth gagged; it doesn't have to be who Varys said he was.Heheh, I don't think it's out of the question that he might have imprisoned a random old man to make a point to Tyrion. I mean, this is Varys we're talking about.
1279	Maxthestig	2013-04-22	This was my favourite scene of the episode and there were a load of great scenes. It's added from the books but this is a perfect example of a good addition. Anyone agree ???????
1280	King of Winters	2013-04-22	That scene has made me interested again in why Varys was cut and what for, and what was the voice that came from the flames?
1281	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	I fucking loved this. I literrally screamed at my TV. Like an ''OOOHHH HOLY SHIT'' moment. Ace.
1282	shiola	2013-04-22	After this episode I'm a little more convinced that Varys might be related to the Targaryens. The sorcerer throwing his manhood on the brazier to complete his spell sounds a lot like what a red priest would do if he had some blood of a king.But he tells the exact same story in the books.  Why did the episode make it more concrete?
1283	wandering	2013-04-22	Great scene, and I agree the box had just arrived and was opened in front of Tyrion to make a point.But ewww, wouldn't Tyrion have noticed the box smelled really, really badly and asked, "What the hell is in that anyway???" right off the bat? Sorcerer friend had come a long way, and there were air holes to let out his scent. You should write a letter to D&D, these kind of plot holes simply won't do.
1284	shiola	2013-04-22	But ewww, wouldn't Tyrion have noticed the box smelled really, really badly and asked, "What the hell is in that anyway???" right off the bat? Sorcerer friend had come a long way, and there were air holes to let out his scent.I honestly had that same thought, hahaha.  Then I realized I was over thinking it.
1285	lostinwesteros	2013-04-22	I LOVED this scene, and am SO happy that Varys finally, finally is able to get revenge justice!About the smell thing that somebody else mentioned, though -- that's true all through the series, and I think we just have to suspend belief over that....can you imagine how Jaime is smelling right about now?
1286	Frey Buffet	2013-04-22	You should write a letter to D&D, these kind of plot holes simply won't do. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />Thought it was a great scene! Was not expecting to see a person in that box.
1287	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	I'm so glad they added the sorcerer in, it was fucking awesome.
1288	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	When Varys is washing his hands and adorning his rings and says ''I resolved to live To spite him'' (great lie delivery too) Tyrion is actually watching the box with a worried expression. Thought that was a pretty good detail.
1289	Spring Snow	2013-04-22	It's probably quite strange but even with incredible, "big" scenes like the mutiny and Daenerys' sack of Astapor, I think Varys' monologue and the subsequent sorceror-in-a-box might be my favorite scene of the episode.
1290	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	I really, really, really loved it. The music accompanying the scene was subtle and fantastic too and the little moment with Varys looking into the dirty mirror. ''All the way to the small council...''
1291	shiola	2013-04-22	I couldn't help but laugh that there was another shot of someone talking into a dirty mirror.  That's been at least one per episode now, I think.  And the premiere had two.
1292	Swagwell	2013-04-22	I wasn't expecting an old man in the box, with all the surrounding talk this came to my  mind: http://www.youtube.c...h?v=T7H9xEesilU
1293	High_Heart_Hag	2013-04-22	After this episode I'm a little more convinced that Varys might be related to the Targaryens. The sorcerer throwing his manhood on the brazier to complete his spell sounds a lot like what a red priest would do if he had some blood of a king.It might also explain why his head is shaved.
1294	victim	2013-04-22	That part about the Sorcerer throwing Varys' junk in the fire directly relates to the scene where Stannis throws the leeches in the fire. I was worried they weren't going to include that scene but now it's all but guaranteed.
1295	Butterknife	2013-04-22	I have no idea what to really say about the whole 'Sorceror' story, it could have been a lie.
I'm wondering if maybe Varys really is a Blackfyre and he was made a eunuch to prevent him from spreading his genes.

1296	Maester Ruin	2013-04-22	when i rewatched the scene i noticed that when Varys talks about still having dreams about that night, he looks at the box while saying "not of the sorceror". amazing little detail
1297	I'll pay the iron price	2013-04-23	Whoa - Varys has a gimp!
1298	Kasrith	2013-04-23	After this episode I'm a little more convinced that Varys might be related to the Targaryens. The sorcerer throwing his manhood on the brazier to complete his spell sounds a lot like what a red priest would do if he had some blood of a king.Nice connection... Especially before Mel gets her hand on a Baratheon bastard. Very interesting!

I was worried they weren't going to include that scene but now it's all but guaranteed.But Varys was in a mummers troupe and grew up poor .....it is never implied that he had any kind of kings blood or any regal genes....but who knows....Martin is never one to shy away from dramatic plot twists
1300	boojam	2013-04-23	After this episode I'm a little more convinced that Varys might be related to the Targaryens. The sorcerer throwing his manhood on the brazier to complete his spell sounds a lot like what a red priest would do if he had some blood of a king.One thing, we have absolutely no evidence that the religion of R'hllor was even existent in Valyria, and we don't know when it came to Essos.There is some jazz in the Wiki about dragon/demise/Targs and fading of Red God power , but there are no references given, and I don't remember anything about it.
1301	boojam	2013-04-23	That scene has made me interested again in why Varys was cut and what for, and what was the voice that came from the flames?Yeah and Varys EMPHASIZES that voice!It's from the book too.So having the sorcerer only settles a minor score it does not solve Varys's problem.
1302	Trident full of Dogs	2013-04-23	Seemed one of the more Varys centric episodes of the series so far. We got two backstory monologues, one about his castration, the other about growing up a thief, and later met with the Queen of Thorns.Also, controversially I will imagine, we got a reveal that Varys keeps the sorcerer who castrated him ritualistically in a small box in his room. That was... pretty unexpected. There's been a lot of theories over the years about "Is Varys possibly not even a eunuch? Maybe his whole backstory is bunk and something else is going on (IE, Blackfyres)?" so this would appear to make it pretty concrete... then again, all we saw was a shivered old man with his mouth gagged; it doesn't have to be who Varys said he was.Nevertheless, I thought Conleth Hill (one of my favorite actors on the show) continued to do fine work.What if Varys is an Unsullied and his story is a cover up. I wonder if someone else is his Master and he only obeys...
1303	SilentSense	2013-04-23	Varys' actor is so good it almost makes up for how badly LF is portrayed in the show. Both of Varys scenes were strong.

Littlefinger was much more prevalent in Book One than he was in Books Two and Three. Remember that Littlefinger was barely present for much of Book Three. I suspect that Littlefinger will have much more juicy scenes in seasons 4 and 5.

Remember that Littlefinger was barely present for much of Book Three. I suspect that Littlefinger will have much more juicy scenes in seasons 4 and 5.But his voice is so annoying.  He speaks in this hushed, whispery sort of voice like "Everything I say is sneaky.  I'm Littlefinger, remember?  I'm sneaky.  Look how clever I am."  /shudders.  I dunno, he's grating on me.  BUt he DOES get awesome scenes at the Vale, so here's hoping.
1307	Johanna Lannister	2013-08-10	When Varys is washing his hands and adorning his rings and says ''I resolved to live To spite him'' (great lie delivery too) Tyrion is actually watching the box with a worried exp<b></b>ression. Thought that was a pretty good detail.I've just watched this episode again and wondered if Varys' ring has the flower of House Tyrell on it? Not that Varys would openly display this.
1308	Starks Among Us	2013-10-17	also it was made clear, in the show at least, that his junk is gone. There was a scene were Ros grabbed for it and was suprised by what she felt


I thought Ros's surprise was because she felt that he was NOT cut. He's parading around asÂ a Eunuch, so why should she be surprised when she grabs him if it's true? I would be more surprised (if I was her) and he was NOT cut. Perhaps this is how they start to their work together? She knows his secret, he wants to keep her in check, he has her spy on LF.

Â 
The reason Ros is surprised when she feels Varys is cut is because she realizes who he is then. Up to that point she had no clue.
1310	Blackf1sh	2013-04-23	I think the creators of the show did a real good job on the mutiny at Craster's keep and I think the way Jeor Mormont died was in a heroic fashion but I remember from reading the books that just before he died he asked Samwell to send word to his son Jorah. I was looking forward to this last request as he was dying to make his death even more dramatic, but they didnt show it. 
Any thoughts on this?
1311	Darkstar For King	2013-04-26	While I also would have loved to see his dying lines, I don't think it would've worked in the show. Having Sam make his way to Mormont, have him say his lines then have Sam leave, while in the meantime chaos is all around and Rast close. It's not very feasible imo.
1312	Lady Lu	2013-04-26	I wanted to see his last words too, and Sam having to be pulled away from his body. Then the part by Craster's wives about the sons. Instead, Sam just... ran.

Any thoughts on this?Its cut down from the narration in the book , but to be expected. Too little time, too much story for a teleplay.But... sure looks like it could have been squeezed in with a little thought to how the action was blocked out.D and D move in mysterious ways at times, sometime they even trump George sometime not.

1314	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-26	I thought the scene was adequate. Mormont being awesome was too far split up in contrast to his death. As in he was really likable in Season 1 with Jon and then we get his death after doing not much besides leading his men to a bloodbath and then quickly retreating. So there wasn't a sense that he was really a great guy before he died. I did, however, like how he casually turns to Rast and completely owns him before dying, but I don't think it was as emotional as it could've been, not due to the this one scene, but due to his overall portrayal until that moment.
That being said the dying words would have been beyond ridiculous on TV. It was always sort of ridiculous in the books since that whole event is supposed to be chaotic and there's no way Sam should've been able to survive it.
1315	Nephew of Dragons	2013-04-26	I thought that maybe the relationship between members of the Mormont family would be dealt with in the series only if future events in WoW & DoS made it entirely necessary, sort of like the Reeds being left out until series 3...
This seems to be happening a lot, and out of the necessity of streamlining the TV narrative...
1316	bobbybuilderton	2013-04-27	What I figure will happen is Rast will go after Sam, gloat about how Jeor was raving about his son (typical villain monologue before killing stroke) or something, then be killed. He will then take on the role of Small Paul (turn into a wight, getting Sam the Slayer name he hates so much and teaching us about the dragonglass).
Or, more likely, Dolorous or someone will kill Rast. Then as Jeor is dying he gives one of them the request instead. Rast comes looking for Sam when he comes back as a wight, Sam finds out about dragonglass.
1317	scurvy	2013-04-27	He doesn't even have a Raven, much less one that talks.  That Raven is a critical plot element in the books.
1318	Buckwheat	2013-04-27	I loved the scene. Mormont showed the real authority and that he deserved to be chosed LC in the last few episodes. I did not miss any words during his death scene. The Mormont family has not even been dealt with by the show much (I am not even sure it was told that Jeor is Jorah's father), so it would come out of the blue.
1319	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-27	I thought it was a really good scene because it was realistic. In real life, especially with criminals, shit can go down real fast and there's really nothing you can do about it except fight, run away or die. The foreshadowing came mainly from knowing what the Night's Watch had been through rather than specific scenes - and it meant the audience would have been as surprised as Mormont was.
In the context of the realism, I don't think Mormont's last words would have worked. Would most likely have come across as cheesy and contrived.
1320	SilentSense	2013-04-27	Show jorah is portrayed as this nice, handsome adviser dude instead of the self centred ex slaver we all know and love from the books. Given that portrayal, tv viewers wouldn't understand the last words. Would they even realize the old bear is the bear knight's father?

Given that portrayal, tv viewers wouldn't understand the last words.

1328	bobbybuilderton	2013-04-27	Yeah, that's possible. I didn't read the books until they were all out and the second season was done (couple months ago actually), so I can't say. But since the writers know some things about where characters are headed just in case GRRM doesn't finish, I think there are some things that they decide based on that knowledge.

Game of Thrones has always shied away from it;  death is sudden and unexpected in the world they've crafted. Sometimes, somebody will say something poignant before they die - "We are the Watchers on the Wall" - but you'll never hear "Tell my wife I love her" kind of lines in this show. It worked fine in the books, but seriously, just imagine Jeor spilling out cliched garbage on-screen as he dies in Sam's arms. For my money, the scene would have been ruined.

I mean, Jeor was one of my favorite characters and I liked Jorah more than there's literally any reason to because of how awesome Iain Glen's voice is, but I totally forgot they were related. I remembered they were both named Mormont but it just didn't click in my mind at all.
1336	JMJ	2013-04-22	Well, for us book readers, that was quite a surprise, eh? Who the heck was that gnarly dude locked inside that box-thing Varys and Tyrion saw? At the time, Varys was explaining how he came to be a eunuch and how he despised all things magic-related. It seemed to imply that the guy was the original warlock who performed the ritual castration on him. Now that would be quite different from the books.  If so, why was Varys keeping him in a box? And why was Varys opening the box anyway? To check on him? If not, who was he?
1337	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	I think it was supposed to be the original sorcerer. The funny thing is, for a brief moment, I thought it was Thoros, given his magical abilities, and began panicking about the direction the show was taking. And the scene seemed to imply that Varys could now torture him in any way he wanted.
1338	Delmas	2013-04-22	People keep saying that Varys keeps this guy in a box.  I did not interept it this way at all.  
I thought rather the sorceress had just been shipped there, and this was the first time Varys had opened said crate.
As for why this dude is even in the show I do not know, perhaps just to show how serious a man Varys really is.

1340	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-22	i assume the guy is a one off, just to show that being pateint worked for varys and may work for Tyrion.
1341	Kernest	2013-04-22	I'd have to say that the whole c*ckless-wonder-that-is-Varys is a lot less important in the books than in the show, by which I mean the fact that he is an eunuch seems to be referenced every single time we see him on the show...
Him being an eunuch/how he became one isn't that important in the books, so I have no problem about this scene...

1347	Tourniquet	2013-04-22	i assume the guy is a one off, just to show that being pateint worked for varys and may work for Tyrion.This.
1348	I'm_Tim	2013-04-22	The theme of the scene was revenge (actually the whole episode) and how to go about it. Varys was describing his slow rise to power and displaying that his patience paid off resulting in having the sorcerer shipped to him. He was telling Tyrion to be patient when he seeks revenge against his sister.
1349	TheEvilKing	2013-04-22	It was Bloodraven.
1350	I'm_Tim	2013-04-22	Also, one thing the show has done for me is reinforced some of the impressions I gathered from the books about Varys. Varys, while having devious methods, is one of the few "good guys." He's always motivated by what's best for the realm, instead of what's best for him. His desire to help Ned was sincere. While he admires Little Finger, he wants to stop him because he's an evil, wicked man. Varys is very selfless, which is a reason they keep reinforcing that he's a eunich. He's a man that's been robbed of a major factor that motivates other men. I'm not sure about a connection with the Targ's, but I wouldn't be surprised by a connection with the Faceless Men. He grew up in the Free Cities and is a master at disguising himself. Or, I could be wrong and he's the most wicked character in the series. /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' />
1351	Buckwheat	2013-04-22	I agree that it was likely the sorcerer that cut Varys that got shipped to KL over the sea recently. I think it has no sense right now, though. I wonder what direction they are going to with this because if it was just this, it seems nonsensical to include it IMO. I wonder what Varys' revenge will be.

I wonder what direction they are going to with this because if it was just this, it seems nonsensical to include it IMO. I wonder what Varys' revenge will be.I honestly think it will be a throw away - just to set the example that something that is important to Varys he will continue to work for and to present to Tyrion that, if he will continue to work, should be able to get the the ends he desires.Oh, and don't cross Varys because he will have you hunted down and boxed up like a birthday present.I did think it was a nice touch to include the airholes in the box.
1353	Buckwheat	2013-04-22	I honestly think it will be a throw away - just to set the example that something that is important to Varys he will continue to work for and to present to Tyrion that, if he will continue to work, should be able to get the the ends he desires.Oh, and don't cross Varys because he will have you hunted down and boxed up like a birthday present.Maybe it will be, but then it will be a little bit of a waste for me. Maybe it is just because Varys looked like he was doing something tremendously important when opening the box, I think most of the people watching expected it to contain something really important for the storyline.I did think it was a nice touch to include the airholes in the box.I agree about that. The first thing I thought of was it contains dragons, which of course makes absolutely no sense, but it was obvious it was a living thing.
1354	StarkDragon	2013-04-22	Book spoilers~
I saw it as foreshadowing Varys naval shipping, since Tyrion becomes the 'Dwarf in a Bottle'. 
I saw it as Varys mentoring Tyrion, to his own likeness.
I saw it as Varys garnering trust in Tyrion, and proving he hates magic when both Stannis and Daenerys, two great enemies to the Throne, use magic of a form.
I would not be surprised if the magician was a simple malcontent, cast into the mummer's play. 
I wouldn't be surprised if the show was that open with Varys past as well, I suppose, but it seems too open played.
1355	Tywin's bastard	2013-04-22	I saw it just as StarkDragon, as a foreshadowing of Tyrion's future (among the other things of course).
1356	JMJ	2013-04-22	The show seems to like spending more time on Varys than the books did - Conleth Hill is awesome, and I don't blame them. Makes me think, how are they going to talk about the Illyrio/Varys backstory? It also begs the question that none of us (except GRRM presumably) know, which is what is Varys' end game?
1357	The Dragon King	2013-04-22	Has anyone ever CONFIRMED that Varys is indeed a eunuch?Varys wants Tyrion to think it's the sorcerer for across the sea but how do you know he's not playing him?  The guy in the box could be some random guy from Westeros.  Also, did it appear that his mouth was sewn shut?  If so I'd imagine he'd die very quickly from dehydration and likely not survive a journey from Essos.
1358	Mike McDee	2013-04-22	Pretty sure the Ros scene last season where Varys gains her as a whisperer proved there was nothing going on downstairs.
1359	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	I was actually really pleased with this scene. I totally did a ''holy shit'' moment.
1360	Iotun	2013-04-22	The scene was rather cool, but if you really stop to think about it, rather unrealistic. Tyrion just happens to walk into Vary's room just as he's opening up a box containing a sorcerer, right in the middle of his chambers, and the topic of conversation is close enough to something that Varys an link with his story about being cut. More than that, Varys would NEVER expose himself quite like that even to Tyrion. Tell him the story of him being cut, yes, but to show him that he secretly has people shipped to him bound and gagged from across the seas?
1361	Dr. Pepper	2013-04-22	It was a really odd scene at first, but I liked the foreshadowing.  Foreshadowing of Tyrion's murderous spree, shipping Tyrion.  And also illustrating that Varys is a man who plays a long and slow game.  Was a good adaptation.
1362	Darth Pipes	2013-04-22	So Varys just found him on eBay?Maybe Varys found him on Craigslist.I liked the scene a lot.  It was a surprise.
1363	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-04-22	Has anyone ever CONFIRMED that Varys is indeed a eunuch?Varys wants Tyrion to think it's the sorcerer for across the sea but how do you know he's not playing him?  The guy in the box could be some random guy from Westeros.  Also, did it appear that his mouth was sewn shut?  If so I'd imagine he'd die very quickly from dehydration and likely not survive a journey from Essos.I think Ros confirmed Varys had "nothing there" last season.Also if the guy is a sorcerer then he can survive for quite awhile without food or water,  there's other examples of this in the books...Melisandre, Moqorro etc.
1364	chris999	2013-04-22	This definately was not in the books, but he did mention the magician, and what he did to him.
It looks to me like the over seas part of the story with merchant Illyrio and Varys' secret friends and plots may get fleshed out more than the books have let on so far. Maybe this means that Aegon's coming story line may be more important than the books have led us to believe so far. 
All I know is that supossedly GRRM has given the producers a version of the end of the story in cause he gets sick or dies, so maybe the producers feel the need to get into more details so that future storylines will make more sense and be easier to adapt to screen later on?
1365	stiff_pirates	2013-04-22	People keep saying that Varys keeps this guy in a box.  I did not interept it this way at all.  I thought rather the sorceress had just been shipped there, and this was the first time Varys had opened said crate.As for why this dude is even in the show I do not know, perhaps just to show how serious a man Varys really is.Agreed. It was definitely a plot device to show that Varys has serious convictions and a darker plotting side to his usual 'whispers'.SPOILER:Don't forget at the end of the third book, Varys is no longer a small council member and isn't too stressed by the amount of main character deaths occuring around him. Also, after his disappearance from KL, he doesn't show until the end of ADWD, where he very capably controls more murders (of Kevan Lannister).
1366	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2013-04-22	Was dudes lips sewn together?  They king of looked like maggots on his mouth, but he wasn't screaming.
1367	mediterraneo	2013-04-22	I saw in this scene an attack to the Lannister's family unity, an attempt to pull Tyrion away, ready to be used after being found guilty of the Purple Wedding.
Things are marching, and the only one in the court that wouldn't feel better if something happened to Jeoffrey is his mother.
Varys's scene is so well planned of (was the old man in the box with his lips sewn, wasn't him?) that I find it difficult to believe that, right now, with the war, the things happening.... Illyrio found the way and the time to send him the warlock.
I took it as another one of Varys's charades, with an old man from flea bottom in the box for Tyrion to be impressed.
But yet, I'm one of the bookreaders not convinced by the often and very high voice stated "public interest" tendences of Varys's.
This man coldblodedly starts civil wars, planning for years from the foreign with other known enriched criminals and scammers (Illyrio), and then tries to sell to you that he did "for the good of the Realm and the smallfolk?"
Maybe his birdie are motivated by that believe. Until he has to kill them because they know too much, and to replace them with newer ones, as we know (book 1) that he does.

1368	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2013-04-23	There was a lot in this scene.
a) It demonstrated Varys's reach and as others have said, his slow game.
b.) It was as a lesson for Tyrion to not be hasty
c) Give a and b: it was a warning for Tyrion too
I really like what they are doing with Varys. Its all gelling far better than Baelish thus far. The only thing I thought was a little out of character was how open Varys was with the QoT so early after meeting.... unless he really felt there was urgency and haste required.

1369	sennahoj	2013-04-23	It looks to me like the over seas part of the story with merchant Illyrio and Varys' secret friends and plots may get fleshed out more than the books have let on so far. Maybe this means that Aegon's coming story line may be more important than the books have led us to believe so far.That's what I thought. We haven't seen Illyrio since the first season, so there's a need to reestablish that connection so that it makes more sense later on when Varys ships Tyrion off. The sorcerer, being yet another priest of the Red God, could also serve for more exposition on the agenda of the red priests which neither Mel nor Thoros would openly divulge on the show. Especially, the importance of royal blood to some of their magic could be emphasized, and this could work to drop some hints about little Aegon and his importance later on.
1370	Walder Waters	2013-04-23	Many questions.
Was the theory about Marwyn being the blood mage wrong or did (only) the show change this part of the story? Is the theory true nevertheless and it is actually Marwyn? Is it possible he somehow gets back to the Citadel? But he should already be there in that timeframe?
1371	bent branch	2013-04-23	Many questions.Was the theory about Marwyn being the blood mage wrong or did (only) the show change this part of the story? Is the theory true nevertheless and it is actually Marwyn? Is it possible he somehow gets back to the Citadel? But he should already be there in that timeframe?I don't know. Was Marwyn mentioned as the person who taught MMD about medicine in Season 1? Here are what I think are the possibilities:1.  The theory is wrong.2.  Marwyn is not going to be a character in the show.3.  If Marwyn is the guy in the books who cut Varys, then it is not an important part of the story and D&D are not going to use it (obviously).They have had to make changes to the way the story is told for tv, so it is hard to say which of these changes are telling something new or different from the books and not just to make the story easier to tell on tv.
1372	protar	2013-04-23	Thought this was a pretty bad scene. It was pointless, wasted time and was detrimental to Varys' character. He's never been that sort of vengeful figure. Like a few things last episode this is just D+D pointlessly trying to stretch their creative muscles at the wrong time.
1373	Peptalk	2013-04-23	Loved that scene. It emphasizes how dangerous Varys is.
1374	Walder Waters	2013-04-23	I don't know. Was Marwyn mentioned as the person who taught MMD about medicine in Season 1? Here are what I think are the possibilities:1.  The theory is wrong.2.

1375	Joyful Union	2013-04-23	Thought this was a pretty bad scene. It was pointless, wasted time and was detrimental to Varys' character. He's never been that sort of vengeful figure. Like a few things last episode this is just D+D pointlessly trying to stretch their creative muscles at the wrong time.Pointless? You must have been watching a different scene. it clearly was showing his reach and influence, and also foreshadowing Tyrion's shipping across to Pentos in a crate, and his wishes for revenge against Cersei in aDwD. We also got some back story for Varys. None of this is pointless, though you may not like the scene.How do you know he isn't a vengeful figure? He sounds pretty mad at the man who cut him in the books, and he hates all magic because of that event.
1376	SnowStorm	2013-04-23	This scene reminded me of the theory that Varys is a secret Targaryen/Blackfyre. I'm not a huge fan of the theory, but it struck me as an odd coincidence for Varys to talk about his story and the spell in this episode after Mel had mentioned the king's blood spell in the last one.
1377	aedalia	2013-04-24	I thought this scene was interesting since it showed that Varys is about the long game. He waited (I'm guessing) 30 years to get revenge on the sorcerer. It shows that him waiting around for Dany to grow up is completely within character.
It was also intersting to me since part of me always thought he lied in the books about how he was cut; I thought maybe he was an escapee Unsullied.

I thought rather the sorceress had just been shipped there, and this was the first time Varys had opened said crate.As for why this dude is even in the show I do not know, perhaps just to show how serious a man Varys really is.I also took it this way. Varys was just opening his long awaited prize for the first time.I think this was 1) To reveal Varys almost compultion/impatience over the one thing Varys could lose his cool over...the one thing he was emotional about. 2) Because he wants to encourage Tyrion to be a problem for Cersi. It fits in his plans so he wanted to show vengence can come for those willing to work...and here is my proof.
1379	Where Boars Glow	2013-04-24	It was Bloodraven.Blasphemer!

Until he has to kill them because they know too much, and to replace them with newer ones, as we know (book 1) that he does.I like your way of thinking concerning VarysÂ´ plan to sow discontent among the Lannisters and maybe he would take this further by letting Tywin know about the Tyrell plan in relation to Sansa, could make a nice twist in tat Varys plays everyone to create confusion in KL, as per the idea we are getting in the end chapter of DwD, when he kills Kevan for that very reason, to make sure the Tyrell and the Lannister alliance is shaky and on the verge of collapse.This would explain why when he gets to knows about LittlefingerÂ´s plans in relation to Sansa, he doesnÂ´t just go to Tywin or Cercei directly, would make much more sense, as he is already master of whisperers working for them, and as far as he is concerned it doesnÂ´t matter who spoils LF plans. Lannisters seem an easier device for this, rather than go through the whole scene with the Tyrells.If I remember correctly in the books, Tyrells do not need a push from anyone and court Sansa on their own accord. I could be wrong though and Varys just might want to use the Sansa thing to try and gain Tyrell influence, but it just seems too easy.Oh, and on the sorcerer thing, does anyone else place any importance on Varys talking about the "blue flames" that the voice was talking from to the sorcerer? Blue = Ice, anyone? I mean unusual flames as opposed to MelÂ´s Red God, who presumably uses normal - "red" flames to send his visions to Mel.

Too many questions unanswered..I don't think we know enough to conclude anything, but my thoughts are that the guy just arrived via crate. he may have had his mouth sewn shut for the journey - maybe there's enough of a hole to force in some water, maybe mush? Anyway, we don't even know what Varys plans to do with him.

1397	julyleo	2013-04-29	I just had an epiphany since Dan and David are in on the ending,ok here it goes. I think they showed the sorcerer because they want the viewers to know that he is a red priest just like Mel and Thoros and how mel was talking about king's blood. Well why would anyone want a limb or blood of some slave unless that slave had some essence of kings blood, or more specifically blackfyre. Couldn't this be a subtle way in the show and even in the book hinting at Varys being a blackfyre I mean what else would a red priest want Varys for?

Couldn't this be a subtle way in the show and even in the book hinting at Varys being a blackfyre I mean what else would a red priest want Varys for?That king's blood has special value does not indicate that ONLY king's blood has ANY value. And it wasn't Varys's blood that was being used, in any case.  If he does have king's blood, why throw away a source of magical reagents after one use?  He obviously survived the casting of the spell and still has blood....
1399	'96Buck	2013-04-29	I thought this scene was interesting since it showed that Varys is about the long game. He waited (I'm guessing) 30 years to get revenge on the sorcerer. It shows that him waiting around for Dany to grow up is completely within character.Also illustrates his reach across the Narrow Sea, which is of particular significance to Tyrion in the future, and is a macro plot driver as well.
1400	Gendels Children	2013-05-11	it will be interesting to see just where (if at all) this story line goes
1401	McShrek	2013-06-13	it will be interesting to see just where (if at all) this story line goesI doubt we'll here any more of it.For all we know, Varys is having some fun with him for some time, and Tyrion, the only other one aware of the sorcerer, knows better than asking Varys what became of his old friend/new toy.
1402	rmholt	2013-07-11	Sorcerer's corpses were supposed to be powerful magic. However, Varys doesnt like magic. It was a pretty creepy scene

1404	Anna Paolinelli	2013-07-14	The scene kind of reminded me of The Mentalist's JJ La Roche and his Tupperware container.  It gave me a nice happy creepy feeling. /devil.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':devil:' />
1405	Petyr Patter	2013-08-11	Also interesting how the guy's mouth was sewn shut, it appears. I'd guess this was to prevent him from casting some spell.I'm pretty sure it wasn't "sewn shut," though the dim lighting in that scene makes it hard to tell.  It actually looks like a thick cord of rope shoved into his mouth and wrapped tightly around the other side, essentially gagging him.  If you pause the scene (DVD recording for the win) you can see it bulge alongside his cheeks.
1406	ninjastark	2013-09-01	I always thought the sorcerer was paralayzed but his mind could still understand what was being done to him.much like he did to varys.and his lessons to tyrion was that sometimes we know whats happening but are powerless(paralyzed) to do anything about it at the time but with time we find ways to achieve our goals
1407	Katydid	2013-04-21	WOW.
They got that scene so, so right!  (And the re-introduction of Dany's not-quite-but-maybe-new-Silver was much appreciated, B&W.)  Well done!

1411	The Flaying Man	2013-04-21	The scene actually surpassed what I envisioned when reading ASOS. I was blown away, and Emilia Clarke was absolutely marvelous. Also, the small bit of High Valyrian we heard from Dany sounds great, hats off to David Peterson!
1412	littlefinger_jr	2013-04-21	fantastic how they translated it to the screen. amazing scene
1413	iheartseverus	2013-04-21	Fantastic language--I don't know anything about languages, but I could have listened to Dany shouting Valyrian all day.
1414	Kasrith	2013-04-21	The Valyrian was epic, and the entire scene... Drogon flying around burning the ramparts/guards was great
1415	Montey14	2013-04-21	that scene was epically bad ass.....as soon as she adressed the unsullied in Valaryian....the slavers knew they were in for a shit storm.....call me crazy but Valaryan sounds almost like a sort of Romanian .....
1416	Capt Banjo	2013-04-21	The Unsullied and Drogon were really well done!
1417	Lord Godric	2013-04-21	The scene really was fantastic.  As amazing as I had hoped for, and as amazing as when I had read it.  From Dany revealing she knew Valyrian to Dracarys to them marching out of the city.  Just absolutely amazing.
1418	Montey14	2013-04-21	Trying to pinpoint what language it might sound like....It almost sounds Romanian
1419	King of the Wall	2013-04-21	It was better than what I had pictured in my head when I read the books. I liked the guy who played Kraznys, but it was awesome to see him burn. I loved Dany's speech when she said Valyrian was her first language, and when she freed the slaves.
I loved Missandei being the first to notice Dany speakiing Valyrian.
The scene of the Unsullied marching out of the city was epic.
1420	Katydid	2013-04-21	The scene really was fantastic.  As amazing as I had hoped for, and as amazing as when I had read it.  From Dany revealing she knew Valyrian to Dracarys to them marching out of the city.  Just absolutely amazing.Their faces when they all realized she had been understanding every word they'd said was priceless.  /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />
1421	Fez	2013-04-21	Emilia was great, the looks on everyone's faces when she spoke were great, the visuals were great, and the music was great.  It was great.
Except...
The underlying premise was really stupid.  It always felt to me like GRRM made the slavers unbelievably stupid so that Dany could get her army, and that translated right over to the show.  Why don't they train the Unsullied to never be able to kill an Astapor slaver.  And if that's not possible, why would they ever agree to sell their entire army?  
I know they have "dragon envy" or whatever, but I can't believe they would be so shortsighted.  Them not understanding the nature of a dragon?  That makes sense.  Them not understanding that someone might try ordering bought Unsullied to attack them?  That doesn't.
I didn't like the chapter, and I didn't much like the scene.  I was really hoping D&D would change the scene a bit, maybe show that the slavers do have quite a lot of soldiers (and not just a handful of guards) and have the Unsullied really have to fight it out a bit.
So, as is, it was very pretty nonsense.  Sorry.
1422	littlefinger_jr	2013-04-21	Their faces when they all realized she had been understanding every word they'd said was priceless.  /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />yea the scene was executed perfectly.

Sorry.I disagree with your criticism. Astapor is a Mega-city in Bravosian terms. This was simply ONE private merchant and his 8000 man army. Astapor as an entire city has more armed men than that. He (the astapori slaver) had never been in a position to sell his entire army before because he had never been in an opportunity to buy a live dragon - which is worth more than 10-8000 men armies. and he was consumed with the lust for power that the ownership of a dragon brings. So he readily agreed believing he was getting the better of the deal. Why isn't it believable - people in fits of lust do all kinds of things. He didn't even presume she spoke Valyrian. To him she was just a dumb, westerosi whore/bitch who was fruitlessly trying to get her kingdom back. She might conquer some little cities along the way - but Astapor!? - Oh no. And look at what she did - she conquered him and his direct part of Astapor  - she didn't go after the entire city. As a matter of fact - she then immediately left the city. So I find it entirely plausible and believable.
1425	Bastard of Boston	2013-04-21	Then, there's also the whole notion that anyone purchasing that many Unsullied -- in most circumstances -- would harbor no resentment towards slavers because they're buying slaves. I'm assuming Krasy just never entertained the possibility that Dany would go all "Civil War" on his ass.
1426	Dragon of Valyria	2013-04-21	The idea of someone killing the slavers just never came up. As the show's dialogue notes -- most people sack cities, sell slaves back to the slavers, and then get more Unsullied later. They profit. Why would they expect someone to take out the slavers? How many people come around who are immune to the lure of money?
1427	Head of The Ned	2013-04-21	Loved everything about this scene
1428	Lord Twat-Beard	2013-04-21	The last shot of the episode where the Unsullied marched out of Astapor whilst the dragons flew overhead nearly brought tears to my eyes. Bravo HBO, you definitely nailed this one.
1429	shiola	2013-04-21	Fantastic scene.  Didn't disappoint in any way.  I can't pick my favorite part of it just yet.
ETA:  That fucking CGI...  God, this show continues to impress and astound me.  All the soldiers, the smoking city, the freaking dragons, Drogon burning the buildings...  It looks and feels so real.

Sorry.Krazyns is a sexist slaver who think Danaerys is a stupid girl. He doesn't think anything of her more than a begging whore with a nice ass. Ya he really wanted a dragon and it's believable that he would be so shortsighted, look at the culture in which he lives he's just a dumbass and got roasted for it
1431	Dma2282	2013-04-21	As a reader, this honestly was the first time I've gotten chills watching a scene since Ned's execution. And it was straight from the book. Not to belittle season 2 and the first episodes of 3, but I haven't been truly awed by a scene in a while (Wildfyre explosion the closest). But this one took the cake, it was the best action scene in the series by far, and in terms of the emotion it raises, it is in the top 3.

1432	Golden Lion	2013-04-21	Not really an episode issue as it happens in the book as well, but why is everything drogon centric? she has two others and they never get mentioned or get anything to do other than the occasional shot to make us remember she has two others.

Sorry.The slavers, in the books as well as in the show, call on the unsullied to defend their "masters".  They never expect that the unsullied would turn on them, even though their training means that they obey without question.  Their dragon greed goes all the way back to the defeat of Old Ghis by the Valyrians because Valyria had dragons.  They just couldn't pass it up, no matter the price.  Plus they underestimated Dany because she was a woman.  I think its plausible.

Sorry.Kraznys was a dumbass.  No denying that.  But I don't see how him being a dumbass hurts the story.  Dany played nicely into that, and I think it's perfectly plausible for them to be arrogant enough never to even consider that Dany - a woman, barely more than a child to their eyes - would just turn on them the second she had the Unsullied at her command.  Combine that with the possibility of owning a dragon - not understanding that there was no way in seven hells that Drogon would be willing to leave his mama - and I don't think it's bad storytelling at all.  Slavers have never traditionally been paragons of intellect, and people fall for cons every day that involve the promess of far less lucrative payoffs.
1436	Winterz	2013-04-21	It was a very exciting scene. I kinda always knew she understood him to some extent but damn I wasn't expecting that turn so soon. Guess we'll see Yunkai this season after all /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />

Why don't they train the Unsullied to never be able to kill an Astapor slaver.  And if that's not possible, why would they ever agree to sell their entire army?  Because if the Unsullied had an overriding loyalty to the Astapor slavemasters they would be worthless as slave soldiers for sale. The whole point of buying Unsullied is that they are absolutely loyal to their master, without question or hesitation. If there are orders you cannot give them, they are no longer the product you're paying for. They would have never sold their entire army, had they not ever been offered a goddamn dragon, which they saw as an once-in-history opportunity.Also, they didn't actually selll their entire army: Astapor also has non-Unsullied troops, but they're stated to be pretty much worthless because Astapor relies on the Unsullied it has not yet sold for its defense. Greed blinded them and they thought: Whatever, we'll make more fucking Unsullied. Just give us that dragon. They didn't consider that Dany would turn her newfound slave army against them because nobody has been in that kind of position before: Nobody could possibly afford ALL the Unsullied in Astapor.

1438	Fez	2013-04-21	To everyone:
Sure, sorry but no.  I refuse to believe that any slaver could be so willfully blind to the idea that a buyer, particularly one from outside the regular paradigm, would ever try to cross them.  It defies my suspension of belief.
Like I said, I'm totally willing to buy into the idea that they wouldn't understand a dragon can't be sold.  I'm also willing to buy the idea that they underestimate Dany (they clearly do).  And, sure, I'm willing to buy that Unsullied can't be trained to NOT obey whatever order their master gives me.  And of course I'm willing to buy that they would do just about anything for a dragon.
What I'm not willing to buy is that would not always have enough other soldiers/slave soldiers on hand to properly defend the city.  As is, its like a gun store owner selling a gun and bullets to someone, and not having a shotgun behind the counter in case the customer gets any ideas.
1439	Broken Fox	2013-04-21	Yeah, we get it. And we disagree.

For an abomination like Kraznos and many of the other slavers, it is outside their thought process that they are doing anything wrong.  They probably feel somewhat protected by the fact that people who buy Unsullied will want to return to but more, pretty hard to do if you destroy their ability to make Unsullied.Also, maybe they never had an order for this many.That is a bit of handwaving, but otherwise, yea it doesn't make a ton of sense.

I understand that they have a budget to consider here, but a few more shots of the Unsullied killing the slavers should have been included IMO. Oh, and the reveal of Daenerys being able to speak Valyrian was great.

What says they hadn't seriously considered that selling all of the unsullied to her might be risky?When offered a once in a lifetime (at best) opportunity, people have been known to go to great lengths and put themselves at great risk to have it.  So why does it have to be the case that they never considered the possibility she might cheat them? Couldn't they have simply concluded that in light of her bemoaning the the way the unsullied are trained and the slaves are treated that she doesn't have the stomach (or if you prefer "the balls") to pull anything.Also, why can't it be that Dany just played him that well?She deceived him on the issue of Valyrian, she let him believe she was soft and allowed him to feel comfortable in the stereotype he believed to be true about women.  Jorah and Barristan speaking out of turn gave him further indications that she was weak and the fact that they objected to the deal in his eyes was proof that he was taking advantage of her.  The point being that people are pre-disposed to believe the things they already want to believe.  He wants to believe she is weak and soft, so he does.  He wants to believe she lacks the stomach to wage a battle, so he does. He wants to believe he is the one taking advantage of her, so he does.  He wants a dragon so bad he'll give up everything for it......so he does....

So I find it entirely plausible and believable.Sorry, but you are wrong. It wasn't just one slaver... all the Unsullied traders gathered to pull that number of soldiers. It's written in the book, that when it comes to Unsullied, there aren't different trainers, they all do it combined, they have a standard to do it.... So, Dany was really buying all of the Astapor's soldiers, they had some personal guards, but not Unsullied (as they said, it wasn't wise to mix them with the other slaves).To everyone:Sure, sorry but no.  I refuse to believe that any slaver could be so willfully blind to the idea that a buyer, particularly one from outside the regular paradigm, would ever try to cross them.

As is, its like a gun store owner selling a gun and bullets to someone, and not having a shotgun behind the counter in case the customer gets any ideas.Think about the context. This is Astapor, they have absolutely no enemy since the fall of Valyria. The Ghiskari cities don't fight one another like the Free Cities, they are at peace. They've been selling these Unsullied to the Free Cities, and their wars for centuries, why would he imagine that she would attack them??? It's completely unheard of. And we're not talking about a single trader, in the books, there is a council of slavers... none of them imagine that she could do such a dishonorable thing. Volantis could have been a threat, but they have been ruled by the elephants for a long time, and the Dothraki don't attack the 3 cities in Slaver's Bay, because that is where they sell of their slaves. That is why it's so easy for Yunkai to make a huge alliance against Dany, she's not only fighting against slavery, but she broke the most important rule that governs their life: a fair trade.
1451	ExileOnDaytonStreet	2013-04-22	I thought it was a damn near perfect scene in an excellent episode.  Things are destined to be condensed, since each season is a mere 10 episodes, so I loved how much detail was thrown into this one scene.  Everything from Missandei's little jaw drop right when Dany starts speaking Valyrian, to the looks between Barristan and Jorah, the way she tested her army before commencing with Operation: Be A Total Badass... I loved it all.Dont... feed... the troll....To be fair:  the way some people gripe about any and all changes made in adapting the books to the screen, I kind of can't blame others for taking the troll seriously in this case.
1452	sennahoj	2013-04-22	Emotionally, I found Dany's speech to the slaves the best part of that scene. Had me tearing up a little bit for some reason. The effects were top-notch, but they were "just" the icing on the cake, what really sold the scene to me was Emilia's performance, especially the seemingly effortless way in which she delivered her Valyrian lines.
1453	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-04-22	The scene was so good that I actually felt an adrenaline rush.
1454	Eric Xayavong	2013-04-22	Gun salesmen usually aren't allowed to sell bullets to someone immediately after or while someone's purchasing a firearm, for that reason.Well this actually reinforces the argument that Kraznys didn't implement any common sense safeguards for his particular trade.Anyways I feel like it's about business and good faith. You don't kill your weapon supplier. They are just a third party in whatever conflict is occurring outside their walls. Can it bite them in the ass? Most certainly. Kinda parallels some real life politics actually. Both blinded by greed and the naivety of good faith.
1455	Nictarion	2013-04-22	Epic scene, it gave me goosebumps while watching. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />I got them as well. So glad they got it right.
1456	Myrish Swamp Thing	2013-04-22	AWESOME!!!!
And I don't even like Dany.
1457	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-04-22	Many people complains about how they should have taught the Unsullied to not attack their masters and I get it, but we're talking about broken men who constantly live in fear to be killed by the simplest offense. Some girl with dragons arrive and not only set them free, but also, orders them to kill their previous tortures: it has almost a religious meaning that whatever prayer has been answered.
1458	JMJ	2013-04-22	This might have been the best scene in the series so far. Awesome. 
As an aside, did anyone else catch the expressions on Jorah and Selmy's faces? No dialogue, but Selmy looked as if he was saying, "yeah, that's how you do it. Nice." While Jorah was, "Hubba hubba, I've got the biggest boner I've ever had right now!"
1459	TomBadgerlock	2013-04-22	Incredible scene! I'm still in awe.This absolutely. Emilia Clarke is astounding.
1460	Dove	2013-04-22	Emilia owned the hell out of that scene and the language, she sounded totally natural and authorative. Loved the slightly smug expression she was rockin'.http://i.imgur.com/0iBS68Z.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/gXTXQjV.jpg
1461	ugashep	2013-04-22	As an aside, did anyone else catch the expressions on Jorah and Selmy's faces? No dialogue, but Selmy looked as if he was saying, "yeah, that's how you do it. Nice." While Jorah was, "Hubba hubba, I've got the biggest boner I've ever had right now!"I loved the look between those two guys at the very end when the unsullied were banging their spears, to me Jorah looked like "this is the greatest thing these eyes have ever seen" and Selmy looked like "Joffrey's ass is....toast".

1464	Eyehate	2013-04-22	re: The look between Jorah and Barristan.
I think this might be the moment when Barristan is completely sure that Dany is of the Rhaegar variety of targaryens
1465	shamshir	2013-04-22	Awesome scene, sort of made Ser Jorah look like an idiot though. In SOS he's the one who advises Dany to pretend not to know Valyrian. He looked shocked in the episode. (I understand this was necessary to make the swerve more effective).

1466	TheDarkOne	2013-04-22	The scene was one of the few things the show has done perfectly this season.
1467	greywindsrage	2013-04-22	It was amazing! I loved every second of it. I loved the look on everyone's face when they realised that she spoke Valyrian. Then she said the magic words "Dracarys"
1468	Exitao	2013-04-22	It's funny, I always thought this actress was more attractive in RL than in the role of Daeny.   But speaking the made up Valyrian she sounded amazing.  By the time she got to "Dracarys!" I was in love.
One of the only scenes that were way better on screen than in print.
1469	Mediumjon Umber	2013-04-22	Awesome scene! But I kinda loled when Drogon flapped in the air like it wasn't a big deal. Yeah, I'm a big lizard with tiny wings. Screw physics!
1470	Rhasgul	2013-04-22	Love the scene and it was close to perfect. Chills running down my spine!
1471	BillBones	2013-04-22	As an aside, did anyone else catch the expressions on Jorah and Selmy's faces? No dialogue, but Selmy looked as if he was saying, "yeah, that's how you do it. Nice." While Jorah was, "Hubba hubba, I've got the biggest boner I've ever had right now!"Hahaha! I'm actually quite sad that things between them, and Dany, will turn out the way they do. Since the two of them exchanged that worried look when Dany offered Kraznys one her dragons last episode, I haven't been able to stop thinking about how awesome a bromance between Jorah and Barristan would be.With that said, I was fistbumping into free air all alone for the last five minutes of the episode.
1472	wandarah	2013-04-22	Anyone who didn't think this scene was magnificent is either living in a different dimension, where they breathe silver and shit gold, or they are simply dead inside. Awesome.
1473	Delmas	2013-04-22	Such an epic scene.  To the people that were disappointed, prepare to have a disappointing life.
As far as the guy who says it is not plausible that they would sell all their unsullied, they took a gamble.  They went all in and lost.
1474	The Mondrian Oak	2013-04-22	She actually said "Dracarys" with a Valyrian accent (with a driller R)! The first time she said it, back in season 2, she said it as a foreigner would. That means she was actually hiding the fact that she knows the language, even back then!

1476	KhalFrodo	2013-04-22	It's up there as one of the best scenes so far in the series.
1477	bippukt	2013-04-22	Great episode overall, and the last scene was really good. After the hatching of dragons, this was THE moment for me as far as Dany is concerned. Best wishes to the 'breaker of chains'.Awesome scene! But I kinda loled when Drogon flapped in the air like it wasn't a big deal. Yeah, I'm a big lizard with tiny wings. Screw physics!Its all magic. Where does physics come in? Where was science when fire was coming from the dragon's mouth? Stop dragging in science where dragons are concerned!
1478	Jamie Lannister	2013-04-22	That was incredible.
1479	Corvinus	2013-04-22	Trying to pinpoint what language it might sound like....It almost sounds RomanianReally? I didn't catch any similarities.
1480	Lady Hornwood	2013-04-22	Awesome scene! But I kinda loled when Drogon flapped in the air like it wasn't a big deal. Yeah, I'm a big lizard with tiny wings. Screw physics!He breathes fire. Maybe he's actually a hot air balloon and the wings are just for steering.Also, the music. Love the unsullied theme!
1481	Sun	2013-04-22	Emilia was great, the looks on everyone's faces when she spoke were great, the visuals were great, and the music was great.  It was great.Except...The underlying premise was really stupid.  It always felt to me like GRRM made the slavers unbelievably stupid so that Dany could get her army, and that translated right over to the show.  Why don't they train the Unsullied to never be able to kill an Astapor slaver.  And if that's not possible, why would they ever agree to sell their entire army?  I know they have "dragon envy" or whatever, but I can't believe they would be so shortsighted.  Them not understanding the nature of a dragon?  That makes sense.  Them not understanding that someone might try ordering bought Unsullied to attack them?  That doesn't.I didn't like the chapter, and I didn't much like the scene.  I was really hoping D&D would change the scene a bit, maybe show that the slavers do have quite a lot of soldiers (and not just a handful of guards) and have the Unsullied really have to fight it out a bit.So, as is, it was very pretty nonsense.  Sorry.Yes, The scene doesn't stand up to examination, or common sense, neither in the books, or now in the show. But as a TV moment it was effective in that it had that Indiana-Jones-outwits-the-german-army-and-escapes-with-the-arc rush. Once you sit down and think about it, it doesn't hold up, but as a moment it is effective, and that's all the show wants. For the logic, they can always point to GRRM.Really? I didn't catch any similarities.The music is what really made the scene good. as it quietly rose from nothing into a crescendo accompanying the very final shot. The music was astounding and elevated that scene to no end.

1482	Dragonstoned	2013-04-22	Thought they could've shown more of the Unsullied killing the slavers / freeing the slaves in the city cos it looked a bit small-scale.
BUT
Loved it, esp the shot when they're leaving Astapor with the militaristic 'fire and blood' music in the background.  Just really really good.

Screw physics!That's the thing though, it's not a big deal.  If problems with physics are going to be a an issue, this may not be the series to watch or read.Loved the scene - especially when the slaver was so engrossed with Drogon he missed Dany speaking in Valyrian.
1484	Warrior Queen	2013-04-22	I absolutely LOVED the scene! I rewinded twice to watch it again!
The dragons, the unsullied, the look of the city, the last shot. All AMAZING!
Especially the language, it sounded so realistic and it felt like Emilia Clacke was a native Valyrian speaker.
The languages -to me- sounded like it was a combination of French, Spanish and some eastern european languages! The Ghiscari dialect sounded like it has some Arabic influences as well. Can't wait to hear more, and I wonder if the Merenees dialect has influences of other languages.

1486	Lady Hornwood	2013-04-22	Is it wrong I got a little turned on by Emilia's Valyrian?I'm a straight woman, but Emilia can come to my house and order me to do things in Valyrian any time she wants.
1487	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-04-22	It was amazing! It was even better than I imagined it in my mind reading it. I loved her speech in the Valyrian language and Emilia Clarke just nailed it. I can't wait until my kids go to bed tonight so I can watch it again.
1488	Tori Targaryen	2013-04-22	Even though I knew the scene was coming, and I knew what would happen, still blew me away. Dracarys!
1489	Dragonstoned	2013-04-22	Also loved Jorah and Barristan looking at each other after like 'sheeeeeeit'
1490	Fez	2013-04-22	Yes, The scene doesn't stand up to examination, or common sense, neither in the books, or now in the show.

For the logic, they can always point to GRRM.Oh it was definitely thrilling to watch in that sense.  It was all very well-done looking and appropriately epic in scale (for TV), and all the actors did an incredible job with the material they were given.  But the commonsense-fail really messes it up for me.  I'm glad it apparently didn't for just about everyone else, but for me it left a sour taste after an otherwise very good (probably top-5) episode.  It would've been even worse except that I already knew it was coming.
1491	DragonsHungry	2013-04-22	That sequence was awesome, a perfect choice to end the episode after the grim plot lines of Jaime, Theon, and the death of Old Bear.
1492	Tyrion's Junk	2013-04-22	I waited all episode...kept looking at the clock, thinking...when will she do it!?!..and by the gods, it was worth the wait. 
She killed that scene and I was smiling ear to ear. I wonder if she will make it to the next city by the next episode.
1493	StarkDragon	2013-04-22	Excellent. I almost had tears in my eyes.
I didn't even care about Pod or the Spider's Mage being confirmed.
That last scene was just too good!
1494	Spidey	2013-04-22	Apart from this scene being immensely awesome and epic, there's one small detail that really stood out to me.Whenever Krasnyz speaks it sounds like he's essentially raping the language, forcing it to convey whatever he means to convey.When Dany spoke however, the language sounded smooth, playful, majestic and commanding, like a free soaring dragon.
1495	DrRobotnik	2013-04-22	One of the awesome scenes in the book, and they got it to perfection.
Epic. Crowning moment of the series so far.
1496	The Mondrian Oak	2013-04-22	Apart from this scene being immensely awesome and epic, there's one small detail that really stood out to me.Whenever Krasnyz speaks it sounds like he's essentially raping the language, forcing it to convey whatever he means to convey.When Dany spoke however, the language sounded smooth, playful, majestic and commanding, like a free soaring dragon.That may be due to the fact that they are speaking two different languages, Astaporian (Kraznys' language) being harsher, and High Valyrian (Dany's) being smoother and more elegant.
1497	DrRobotnik	2013-04-22	Awesome scene! But I kinda loled when Drogon flapped in the air like it wasn't a big deal. Yeah, I'm a big lizard with tiny wings. Screw physics!That's kind of what the pteranodon and other winged dinosaurs did all the time.
1498	Nomad/	2013-04-22	This whole scene was awesome. Nothing to criticize.
1499	Warhawk137	2013-04-22	While the people in this thread pointing out that it was very dumb of Krasnyz to sell his entire army are completely correct, I think y'all are underestimating the potential for hubris to lead an arrogant and greedy man into folly.  The way he spoke to Daenerys in their previous negotiations, even in spite of the fact that he believed she did not understand what he was saying, demonstrates his overbearing pride.
And, y'know, if Daenerys actually had enough money (or equivalent) to buy all the unsullied, maybe Krasnyz would have thought better of it and not gone through with the deal, for this very reason - he can get money from lots of people, and because of that, he'd be able to take a more detached view of the deal he was contemplating.  But the prospect of obtaining a dragon perhaps blinded him to better judgment.
Basically, if you want to tempt a rich man, don't offer him more simple riches.  Offer him something he could otherwise never have.
1500	Gannicus	2013-04-22	Dany has been great this season. I got to say she is much improved from the books.
1501	DrRobotnik	2013-04-22	What I'm not willing to buy is that would not always have enough other soldiers/slave soldiers on hand to properly defend the city.  As is, its like a gun store owner selling a gun and bullets to someone, and not having a shotgun behind the counter in case the customer gets any ideas.Well, greedy gun store owners might sell you their last shotgun if it gets them a dragon.I suppose the slavers aren't used to selling eight thousand Unsullied all in the one go. Nobody but Dany has dragons, so nobody else can afford to buy all the Unsullied.A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity came along, and they got greedy.
1502	boojam	2013-04-22	Emilia was great, the looks on everyone's faces when she spoke were great, the visuals were great, and the music was great.

Why don't they train the Unsullied to never be able to kill an Astapor slaver.  And if that's not possible, why would they ever agree to sell their entire army?  Well , one thing, GRRM does not bring this up or maybe he had it in the back of his mind, I think the Astapori trainers of the Unsullied never , in their wildest dreams, thought someone would buy slaves and then free them. My guess it had never happened?GRRM is a little inconstant in the books , the long story by Kraznys of how the Unsullied are made ... seems to paint them as robotic terminators.All independent thought washed away.Yet in the book, when offered their freedom they take, even tho Grey Worm keeps his name apparently other Unsullied change names. GRRM , after Astapor had one and only one elaborated Unsullied character, Grey Worm.... Grey Worm , is chosen by the Unsullied (in fact apparently  other Unsullied officers were picked by the corps , but we never find out who they are.)Tho mostly silent Grey Worm (an absolute Unsullied) is capable of independent thought, seemly implying the rest of Unsullied are too. Dany's freeing them and then having them stay as her devoted army is a square wave in the whole Unsullied thing.So I chalk it up to GRRM's doing the narrative 'road not taken' , GRRM is full of surprise and never elaborating the obvious , I love surprise!

1503	Warhawk137	2013-04-22	Awesome scene! But I kinda loled when Drogon flapped in the air like it wasn't a big deal. Yeah, I'm a big lizard with tiny wings. Screw physics!Which part are you referring to?1. Maybe they've got lightweight bones.2. He was doing plenty of flapping in the transfer scene.3. The scene at the end was the one with more gliding - maybe you can chalk that up to thermals.  Not really my area of expertise, but I suppose if the water there (Astapor is on the coast) is cooler than the surrounding air, a breeze coming in over the water could push the warm air over the desert around Astapor up, so once the dragon gains some elevation it might be easier to stay aloft?  I'm sure someone who wasn't an English major can tell me if I'm right.
1504	GoldenFleece	2013-04-22	Although no-one as mentioned it yet, thought it was a nice touch of Dany dropping the slavers whip into the dust, with the unsullied trampling over it.  A great symbol of what Dany will become.
1505	Arwyl	2013-04-22	Just saw the episode. This scene was amazing! They did it right! That moment when she said "Unsullied!" in Valyrian, and the camera showed everyone else's expression was just so great and almost exactly how I pictured the scene when I read aSoS.It is done!

Everyone was immediately shocked but Kraznys only reacted when she addressed him directly. Minor nitpick in an otherwise stellar scene.
1507	boojam	2013-04-22	I had to be amused by Dave and Dan playing off the non-readers.
Some figured out that Dany spoke Valyrian (both High and Low)from glances and facial expressions , tho, sure seemed ultra subtle to me.
So D and D fold this into the Dracarys! scene in the show,it works!
Well it's the same in the books except we readers know, tho it's odd that no one in or around the Slavers noticed that Dany didn't look like anybody in her party and no one knew the history of Valyria and what Valyrians looked like.
The book had Dany give the appearance of not understanding Low Valyrian for strategic purposes.
They left out Dany's long conversation in High Valyrian with  Missandei .... it seemed in episode 3 when Dany got  Missandei she seemed to have figured out that Dany spoke Valyrian, but in episode 4 when Dany spoke it for the first time, she seem surprised. Odd.
A minor bit of trivia twice now (I don't think more than that) Dnay has said "of the blood of Old Valyria" , interesting since , if we can believe the Targ family tree, she is not pure blood Valyrian.
(Tho being a Targ makes that almost a distinction without a difference.)
So I applaud D and D's dramatic use of Valyrian.
(It is never explained why, in the books that Dany speaks Valyrian , since George being the good author he takes it that the reader can figure out that since Dany grew up in the Free Cities that she would speak Low Valyrina , and for sure that Viserys would have insisted she speak High Valyrian , since he was about 10 when he left KL. So it was a nice touch when Dany in E4 said that Valyrian (really High) was her "mother tounge".)

1508	Hear me Meow	2013-04-22	Dany has been great this season. I got to say she is much improved from the books.It has been a while since I read her chapters in SoS but iirc she is pretty accurate at the moment. It is not like the show came up with her double cross of the slavers and her sack of Astapor.Grrm's story for her just makes really good tv at present.
1509	TheDarkOne	2013-04-22	I feel this was Danny's best moment on the show, and perhaps the finest for a very long time.
1510	Northbound	2013-04-22	They did a great job, with the entire scene. It played out, far better than I thought the TV show would make. Brilliant work and kudos to the show creators.  Only bad part apart it; the road where thousands die in Dany's path, has now begun. That part in the books and now, show; is where I began to pull my support and like for Dany.
1511	PatrickStormborn	2013-04-22	It thought it weird that Kraznys took a while to realize she spoke Valyrian though. Everyone was immediately shocked but Kraznys only reacted when she addressed him directly. Minor nitpick in an otherwise stellar scene. The same was true in the book too, though - only one of the Masters noticed she was speaking Valyrian, because the others were too preoccupied with Drogon.
1512	Milcov	2013-04-22	They left out Dany's long conversation in High Valyrian with  Missandei .... it seemed in episode 3 when Dany got  Missandei she seemed to have figured out that Dany spoke Valyrian, but in episode 4 when Dany spoke it for the first time, she seem surprised. Odd.I think it's just that Valar Morghulis and Valar Dohaeris are just such well known phrases that it doesn't matter, I mean assuming you speak English as a first language I'm sure you could count plenty of foreign phrases you know, Spanish, French, Latin all have phrases which lots of people know despite not speaking them.
1513	Eric Xayavong	2013-04-22	I think another thing worth mention with regards to Kraznys' underestimation. I'm assuming the Unsullied require commands spoken in Valyrian. What immediate threat could Dany possibly pose to Kraznys if she needed a slave to command her army. What risks would she take in giving Missandei the power to control her entire army. Missandei isn't possibly as broken in as say... Reek.
1514	Crown	2013-04-22	Extremely well done, D&D! Loved it.
1515	Frey Pie a la Mode	2013-04-22	The framing of Dany walking toward the Unsullied (shot at an angle and from slightly below), with Drogon framed above her in the sky, was epic. 
I do admit that while the scene was outstanding, I missed Dany's actual delivery of "Dracarys" from the book.
"Drogon," she said sweetly. "Dracarys."
Somehow, saying his name "sweetly" made a big impact on me. She just says the command in a straightforward manner on the show.
1516	~Shiera Seastar~	2013-04-22	Also loved Jorah and Barristan looking at each other after like 'sheeeeeeit'They learned their lesson from the previous ep: Never question your Queen in front of strangers. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />While the people in this thread pointing out that it was very dumb of Krasnyz to sell his entire army are completely correct, I think y'all are underestimating the potential for hubris to lead an arrogant and greedy man into folly.  The way he spoke to Daenerys in their previous negotiations, even in spite of the fact that he believed she did not understand what he was saying, demonstrates his overbearing pride.Maybe like Dany, Krasnyz was thinking he can use Drogon to turn against his momma and take back the Unsullied - but unfortunately, he can't make a dragon his slave.
1517	Katydid	2013-04-22	Well this actually reinforces the argument that Kraznys didn't implement any common sense safeguards for his particular trade.Anyways I feel like it's about business and good faith. You don't kill your weapon supplier. They are just a third party in whatever conflict is occurring outside their walls. Can it bite them in the ass? Most certainly. Kinda parallels some real life politics actually. Both blinded by greed and the naivety of good faith.I always got the feeling that it was not only the slavers' greed that blinded them to the possibility of having the Unsullied turned against them, but their severe underestimation of Dany herself.  Kraznys is an arrogant prick, speaking Valyrian willy-nilly, insulting and degrading Dany and assuming she doesn't understand a word he's saying.  That same arrogance would have him assuming that Dany could never be smart enough to turn the tables on him.That, plus his salivating over owning a dragon, shows what an idiot he really is.  He obviously never stopped to consider "hmmm, can I actually manage and control a dragon?" just as he never stopped to consider Dany's brain power.

"Dracarys."Somehow, saying his name "sweetly" made a big impact on me. She just says the command in a straightforward manner on the show.This was exactly my thought.  The only thing I'd have liked to see in that scene was Dany calling up to the dragon "sweetly" and him looking down at her before she gave the kill order.  It not only showcases Dany's youth and girlishness (which is a large part of what makes her so endearing to her people), but it also shows the strength of her connection with her dragons.
1519	winterstood	2013-04-22	Sorry, but you are wrong. It wasn't just one slaver... all the Unsullied traders gathered to pull that number of soldiers. It's written in the book, that when it comes to Unsullied, there aren't different trainers, they all do it combined, they have a standard to do it.... So, Dany was really buying all of the Astapor's soldiers, they had some personal guards, but not Unsullied (as they said, it wasn't wise to mix them with the other slaves).My comment was based on the TV show. I believe that's what the OP was trying to criticize - so I stuck to that. But the book version is still believable. 1)  DRAGON...once in a lifetime opportunity! 2) They continually and seriously underestimated Dany - never thinking for a second that she would pull a move like that.
1520	Roose Seal	2013-04-22	The same was true in the book too, though - only one of the Masters noticed she was speaking Valyrian, because the others were too preoccupied with Drogon.Yeah I know, but it just looked weird on screen seeing her shouting out commands and Kraznys struggling with Drogon in the background. Really not a big deal though.
1521	StarkDragon	2013-04-22	Yeah I know, but it just looked weird on screen seeing her shouting out commands and Kraznys struggling with Drogon in the background. Really not a big deal though.Caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
1522	Sand Snake of Dorne	2013-04-22	People talking about how dumb Kraznys and the slavemasters were: you're missing an important historical point, one that is crucial to understand the whole Dany arch. George Martin brings a modern slavery vision into the story, through the eyes of Dany. She sees slavery and thinks the way we would, she thinks it's terrible, unbearable. This can be justified by the fact that she spent her entire life hiding and running and doesn't really know a thing about life or war, and also is kind of heart. It's very clear how mildly all other characters look to slavery in the books: the slaves themselves have a problem with being free in many cases, they don't know what to do with this new society she builds, and they want the old order to return (in the books, after this event). Not all of them, of course. And of course, many people come to agree with her point of view, but it is very confusing either way, she brings something nobody never imagined it could be. That's why unsullied weren't trained no to attack their previous masters, that's why it's NOT dangerous to sell 8000 unsullied to one person: why on earth would somebody free them? Why would anybody attack Astapor? I don't really remember if it's Astapor, but one of this slave cities it's described as not having any kind of physical defense whatsoever, because why on earth would somebody attack slave traders? It would be the same as killing blacksmiths ou sellswords - they're often essential to war. Westeros is clearly different for banning slavery, but as Jorah arch proves, slavery is not all that far away from westeros and westerosis' minds. (P.S.: sorry bout any spelling mistakes, english is not my mother tongue).
1523	-Ghost-	2013-04-22	I wish Emilia could just speak Valyrian the whole show. I like her better that way.
I really wanna meet Grey Worm
1524	BlackTalon	2013-04-22	maybe show that the slavers do have quite a lot of soldiers (and not just a handful of guards) and have the Unsullied really have to fight it out a bit.So, as is, it was very pretty nonsense.  Sorry.No it is not.Unsullied are usually sold of in batches of a hundred there, three hundred there, maybe a thousand every once in a very great while. Ordinarily the slavers would always have retained numerical superiority with the unsold Unsullied. Anyway, the slave trade has been going on for so long and is so long established in Astapor and the whole Slaver's Bay, with unspoken rules, conventions and traditions (see Dragon of Valyria's post #20) that I find it absolutely believable that it never crossed the slaver's minds the Unsullied could and would be used against them.Also, the slavers DO NOT have a large number of guards, what would they need them for with 8600 of the best soldiers in the world guarding their city?

It's all i can say really...
1526	zaphodbrx	2013-04-22	Superb moment, loved it.
However, show-Dany has clearly known valryian before if you pay attention. She talks to a slave hung up in the walk of punishment.

She talks to a slave hung up in the walk of punishment.But the slaver(s) didn't know that. Their reactions to her addressing the Unsullied was one of the most priceless moments of the series. /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />

1529	Mark Antony	2013-04-22	guys, any idea where to get danny's speech? (valyrian speech I mean).You mean to watch? It's on Youtubehttp://www.youtube.c...h?v=mg7U5bhfT_0
1530	dreamcatcher	2013-04-22	Apart from this scene being immensely awesome and epic, there's one small detail that really stood out to me.Whenever Krasnyz speaks it sounds like he's essentially raping the language, forcing it to convey whatever he means to convey.When Dany spoke however, the language sounded smooth, playful, majestic and commanding, like a free soaring dragon.High and Low Valyrian.. As a linguist, these tidbits make me immensely happy :,)
1531	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-04-22	What I like the most about the way Jorah and Selmy look at each other is that they seem to be thinking "we are soooo going home now", which made the scene unintentionally cruel.
Drogo's cry broke my heart: "mommy, mommy!".
1532	The Mondrian Oak	2013-04-22	High and Low Valyrian.. As a linguist, these tidbits make me immensely happy :,)And, as an interpreter, I cheered every time Missandei understated Kraznys' insults! Well done girl!

1533	King of Winters	2013-04-22	I got chills when she said they were free and she said they could go if they chose to and then they all started to bash their spears on the ground and you knew Dany had finally become a badass.
1534	mitch176	2013-04-22	Absolutely nailed it! So happy with this episode, feel that they got everything right. 
An interesting note is that I watched this episode with my father (Who hasn't read the books) and the first thing he said was that she should've left some troops in Astapor. Mistake number 1 by Daenerys even being recognised by only show watchers.
1535	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	OH MY GOOD GOD I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE MY REACTION JUST WATCHED IT CANT STOP REWINDING THIS SCENE ON SKY IM LITERALLY SHAKING WITH EXCITEMENT THIS WAS AMAZING TV OH MY GOOD GOD
1536	Waterfall	2013-04-22	The scene was good enough to make me post again in stead of just reading everything. It elevated the show back to season 1 levels, the execution was just that good.
1537	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-22	When Dany said Valyrian was the language of her mother I almost got a bit choked up, and I never react like that to TV. Barristan and Jorah was great too. That look they share was basically how every viewer felt, Dany fan or otherwise.
1538	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	I'm still rewatching the scene I honestly can't stop.
The execution of her lines (the Valyrian sounded PHENOMENAL), the fucking SPECTACULAR MUSIC, the widened eyes of the slavers as they realise shit is about to go down. The sound before Drogon blew that initial badass flame. The stamping of the spears. The ''holy shit'' look from Missandei, the three dragons in the air, the marching from the city, the nonchalant way she flings the slaver's whip aside and the amazing music all the way through oh god DAMN I SAID GOD DAMN that was fucking spectacular. A real treat to watch.

1539	Runaway Penguin	2013-04-22	I read Jorah's and Barristan's reaction to Valyrian not as a surprise that Dany speaks Valyrian - both of them would know - but as a surprise "She just proved she undersood all the time and uncovered her cards... Midden is going to hit the ventilator". And both got ready to draw... While Missandei's surprise was quite puzzled and Kraznys was completely out of his depth.
1540	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	Also the little detail of High and Low Valyrian; with Kraznys spitting his words and Dany's rolling off her tongue. Simply spectacular.
1541	King of Winters	2013-04-22	Also the little detail of High and Low Valyrian; with Kraznys spitting his words and Dany's rolling off her tongue. Simply spectacular.Yeah I noticed that. Was that Dany speaking proper Valyrian?
1542	Woel	2013-04-22	I'm still rewatching the scene I honestly can't stop.The execution of her lines (the Valyrian sounded PHENOMENAL), the fucking SPECTACULAR MUSIC, the widened eyes of the slavers as they realise shit is about to go down.

A real treat to watch.You sort of summed up my reaction. I was actually shaking when the credits came on. And the High Valyrian was epic. I want to learn it.
1543	Battlekitten	2013-04-22	Drogo's cry broke my heart: "mommy, mommy!".Exactly. They even got the dragons desperation right. And then when he turned on Krazys and WhooshHe was in his element. Fire and blood
1544	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	Yeah I noticed that. Was that Dany speaking proper Valyrian?Yes. She was speaking High Valyrian. And Kraznys was speaking Low Valyrian with a Ghiscari accent. You sort of summed up my reaction. I was actually shaking when the credits came on. And the High Valyrian was epic. I want to learn it.I was actually shaking aswell and the music was beyond amazing and just THEY NAILED THIS SCENE. Oh man, I could listen to High Valyrian all day.
1545	A Real Dire Wolf	2013-04-22	It was a combination of this scene and the dragon hatching scene that made me like Daenerys. Such badass, amazing, powerful scenes. /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />
Both made even better by music... anyone else notice how this scene had that awesome "Finale" version of the main theme from the dragon hatching scene, but with chanting added that made it a bit darker?
1546	Woel	2013-04-22	Yeah I noticed that. Was that Dany speaking proper Valyrian?It was proper High Valyrian, yes. You should read David Peterson's blog (dothraki.com) - everyone should! It will get you excited about friggin declensions. One fascinating thing is that Dany uses the Ghiscari word for slave, buzdari, but the High Valyrian word for slave is dohaeriros, because she wanted Kraznys and the slavers to understand her. Read more here.
1547	SlySupremacy	2013-04-22	Amazing scene, the very last part where the Unsullied are marching out of the city and the three dragons are flying overhead was pretty epic, better than what I visioned when reading the book.

Read more here.Oh, that's wonderful! What an awesome little detail. + Buzdari at the end of each line sounded AMAZING.
1549	Gogossos	2013-04-22	I think Dany's epic music theme makes both this and the season 1 finale scene, um, epic. It's also probably why she has more tv-only fans than book fans.
1550	wandering	2013-04-22	Was Dany speaking different languages other than Valyrian and English?
1551	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	Was Dany speaking different languages other than Valyrian and English? Apparently, someone just mentioned she was using the Ghiscari word for ''slave'' so the slavers would definitely know what she was on about.

1553	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	The music of tonight? I thought it was spectacular.
1554	Spring Snow	2013-04-22	Same here. I thought everything about that scene and the transition to credits was executed wonderfully. The only possible thing that could have made it better would have been Dany whipping the slaver full-on in the face, but I didn't particularly miss it.
You have to smile at how much more prominent Drogon is in the show *and* the books. Such a diva!
1555	mafalda	2013-04-22	Perfection! I looked like a bird about to take flight during the entire scene!Tip of the hat to David Peterson, Valyrian sounds beautiful! I'm hoping they do the same thing with Valyrian that they did with the Dothraki language and post some of it online. I'd love to learn a few words. Though the only Dothrak I ever learned was sheik ma sherraki. I'm 98% sure I mispelled that too.And I loved Barry and Jorah drawing their swords at the same time.I remember the last eppy, people were complaing about why Dany was wearing the same outfit for two eppys. I was like "Wtf is that to complain about?" But on the third eppy, same outfit, I now understand. She still looked amazing though, and with that cape! She's gorg! Her and Missandei /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />Dracarys, bitch!
1556	Lady Martell	2013-04-22	Dracarys! Dracarys! Everything was just amazing, my God the music fit perfeclty.
1557	shiola	2013-04-22	Barristan & Jorah "Aww yeah gurl" face appreciationhttp://25.media.tumb...pxxpo1_1280.png
1558	lostinwesteros	2013-04-22	It was the BEST kick ass scene I've ever seen.  The ending, with leaving the city on horseback, dragons flying overhead, and all those unsullied was beyond description.  I also really loved the part when she freed the Unsullied, told them they could leave it they wanted to, without repercussion, but then asked if they wanted to fight for her as free men, and they all started jabbing the ground with their swords.  Cool!

Like Spanish in Spain versus Spanish in Mexico.
1560	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	This has been one of those universally enjoyed scenes. Great stuff.
1561	RememberTheNorth	2013-04-22	I have a question and I really hope someone can answer it. It's been a while since I've read SoS so I don't remember...
I was wondering why Dany was wearing the same blue dress throughout her 3 episodes presented so far. Is it possible that the entire events in Astapor occurred over the course of a single day? Don't remember the way things unfolded in the books so I was wondering if this was plausible. I mean, when she arrives in Astapor it almost looks as if it's late night or early morning, and when leaving Astapor it appears dark again.
Just wondering.
1562	Zorral	2013-04-22	Admit to curiosity as to how she's going to feed 8000 slave soldiers plus 3 growing dragons.Presumably the dragons can or will be able to gather their own food very soon.  But 8000 soldiers.  That's devastation wherever they go.  Armies tended to live by pillaging in those days.  And if this one doesn't pillage, from where cometh the food while marching elsewhere from Astapoor?
1563	PatrickStormborn	2013-04-22	I have a question and I really hope someone can answer it.

I mean, when she arrives in Astapor it almost looks as if it's late night or early morning, and when leaving Astapor it appears dark again.Just wondering.Yeah, the scenes have taken place over around 3 days. In episode 1, she is told to decide by "tomorrow" whether she wants the Unsullied, and then we see her the next day deciding to buy them. Presumably only one day passes between making the decision to buy them and actually "buying" them.
1564	Starq	2013-04-22	She sounded so sexy when speaking Valyrian... Dany was hot as hell in this episode <3
1565	Ghosteline	2013-04-22	That scene was done so so well. Loved all the little details as well. For an example the change in Drogons voice when Dany turned her back and walked towards her new army. Drogons screams were almost a bit agonizing as if "baby dragon losing his mommy".
This is how Dany should be, fierce. Shes often too sweet and doll-like. I didn't like her hair curly - made her look innocent girl. Her looks should be a bit rougher - but then again thats just nitpicking. It was an epic scene.
1566	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	The soundtrack so far this season was a bit disappointing IMO, given the quality of s2's soundtrack, but that final score, combined with Dany marching out of Astapor with her Unsullied was just insanely badass. Loved the Middle Eastern tinge to it.
1567	boojam	2013-04-22	Admit to curiosity as to how she's going to feed 8000 slave soldiers plus 3 growing dragons.Presumably the dragons can or will be able to gather their own food very soon.

And if this one doesn't pillage, from where cometh the food while marching elsewhere from Astapoor?Well even George is a little loose about this. I can't remember exactly , in the book, seems GRRM suggests there is a supply train traveling. Plus Dany had the complication that there tens of thousands camp followers, mostly ex slaves who did not want to stay in Astapor. Seems I remember on the trip to Yunkai was difficult but not impossible. Seem to remember the trip from Yunkai to Meereen was more difficult , I think Meereen did a 'scorched earth' tactic, plus she picked up more camp followers. George is kind of bored with logistics I think.D and D are even worse, people not on horse back don't seem to carry anything!Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie are caught caring just swords and nothing else! (That they went back to Harrenhal and got the swords is nuts.) I think in the books travelers are mostly on horseback and have supplies.

1568	chris999	2013-04-22	Emilia was great, the looks on everyone's faces when she spoke were great, the visuals were great, and the music was great.  It was great.Except...The underlying premise was really stupid.  It always felt to me like GRRM made the slavers unbelievably stupid so that Dany could get her army, and that translated right over to the show.  Why don't they train the Unsullied to never be able to kill an Astapor slaver.  And if that's not possible, why would they ever agree to sell their entire army?  I know they have "dragon envy" or whatever, but I can't believe they would be so shortsighted.  Them not understanding the nature of a dragon?  That makes sense.  Them not understanding that someone might try ordering bought Unsullied to attack them?  That doesn't.I didn't like the chapter, and I didn't much like the scene.  I was really hoping D&D would change the scene a bit, maybe show that the slavers do have quite a lot of soldiers (and not just a handful of guards) and have the Unsullied really have to fight it out a bit.So, as is, it was very pretty nonsense.  Sorry.I love the show, and I can understand the complexities they are dealing with in such a huge production, so I try not to be too critical, but the number one thing they lack every time so far is the major battles.I know, easier said than done... and they did do a good job of the Blackwater... but The Fist of the First Men vs the Nights Watch was nothing but a faded screen and the noise of swords clanging in the background. Also the battle between the Lannisters and Robb's scouts in season one was nothing except Tyrion getting knocked out.I am starting to wonder how they are going to pull off the mother of all battles that this series is going to end with?
1569	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	I hate to say it but Dany makes such a good conqueror Queen. I like seeing her full on Boudicca. Ugh, Meereen is coming...

1587	Exitao	2013-04-22	Thought they could've shown more of the Unsullied killing the slavers / freeing the slaves in the city cos it looked a bit small-scale.BUTLoved it, esp the shot when they're leaving Astapor with the militaristic 'fire and blood' music in the background.  Just really really good.The Unsullied were supposed to fight in phalanx formations in shield walls.  That means they would have fought almost shoulder to shoulder with shields almost overlapping.The actors playing the Unsullied clearly weren't very good at fighting that way.  Training a group (of extras?) to do well enough for one scene appears to have been beyond them, perhaps for budget or time constraints.  How could they do the rest of the city?I'm not really citicising HBO for this, just pointing out the facts.
1588	Dagon Greyjoy	2013-04-22	The slaver cities Yunkai and Meereen are not defenseless.No... But astapor was.

1590	Exitao	2013-04-22	every fight scene, i just tell myself. "there are ten times as much of everything going on right now"bottom line is hbo is too cheap to do some stuff rightI wouldn't really criticise HBO so harshly.  Money is often a bottom line, however, we don't always see past the obvious/immediate expenses.How much time would have been required to train a bunch of actors to perform this particular style of combat well?-  it has to be well disciplined, coordinated and safe.How much would that time cost and in what ways?- cost of trainers/experts- cost of actors to train- cost of added insuarce for extended battle scenes- all the above costs in addition to normal costs...Can the producers afford to spend the Time itself?- budgetting and expenditure of time itself the hardest.  you can get more actors, more money, but never more time.Long term, what will this cost?- will we be able to get the same actors back?- will they balk and demand more money?- will we have to spend more time and more money, as above, to keep up the same production values?This series is really rather well done.  And I think we might be a bit spoiled now.Finally, there is another explanation:If they had done a prolonged and comprehensive battle, Dany would not have had such a brilliant moment.

1594	Exitao	2013-04-23	I've watched this scene repeatedly.  Different times focusing on different aspects, the Valyrian, the troops, the dragon, the music, and most of all Emilia's acting.Besides her rendering of the Valyrian language, there is her voice. She'd been firm and authoritative a few times, but until now, she never truly displayed a Command voice.  It had a pleasing roughness to it too.Emilia's expressions are the best yet.  The look Dany gives when Krasnys says the deal is done, the trepidation as she goes to address the Unsullied, and a moment of pleasure as they obey the "forward march" and she smiles as she gives the order to "halt."From the interviews I've watched, Emilia is one of the actors who has read the books carefully.  I think it shows, and it satisfies me because when she gives that smile, and then turns around to answer Kraznys she seems full of the emotions one might expect of a begger princess become a begger queen now suddenly holding the power to claim what is hers and enact a change on the wrongs of the world around her and to punish those for a life-time of slights and offenses, the latest of which was Kraznys' disrespect to her and his treatment of the slaves.
1595	Nictarion	2013-04-23	Lol...I always fell like such a freak when people say things like this. I am one of what seems to be a small minority that really enjoyed the Meereeen chapters. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />I liked them as well. Of course Dany is my favorite character though so I'm a little biased.  Personally I don't mind all the Daario stuff, which is a lot of people's complaints about those chapters. Plus Dany riding off on Drogon is such a huge payoff. We are definitely in the minority around here though.
1596	kephv	2013-04-23	every fight scene, i just tell myself. "there are ten times as much of everything going on right now"bottom line is hbo is too cheap to do some stuff rightPretty much. Scene was cringe worthy.I wouldn't really criticise HBO so harshly.  Money is often a bottom line, however, we don't always see past the obvious/immediate expenses.Would've rather had something that didn't look so poorly executed than the 20 second cgi shot of the dragons and the army at the end.
1597	Joyful Union	2013-04-23	There's still Yunkai, which was not so bad, and the Fighting Pit scene to look forward to. I suspect D+D know how slow the Meereen chapters read, so I am hoping they will "fix" that.Here's hoping that Daenarys in the show just burns Mereen to the ground, as soon as she gets there.
1598	Toxspecific	2013-04-23	If they can fix Dany's boring to the point of tears storyline, it will be so amazing.

Noticed that tidbit too. Agree - Emilia's acting was excellently done. I'd add the tiniest bit of trepidation when she freed the Unsullied and was waiting to see if they would still follow her. Also to add re: the issue of Unsullied fighting formation in some of the other posts, I would think re: the Unsullied fighting formations, that would be (a) on command, and (/cool.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='B)' /> they were not fighting an opposing army. They were merely commanded by Dany to kill their former masters. Dany did not command them to take battle formation (she presumably at that time would not know that anyway), and forming a phalanx doesn't seem like it would be that useful against a handful of guards and unarmed masters.
1600	GoldenFleece	2013-04-23	Admit to curiosity as to how she's going to feed 8000 slave soldiers plus 3 growing dragons.Presumably the dragons can or will be able to gather their own food very soon.  But 8000 soldiers.  That's devastation wherever they go.  Armies tended to live by pillaging in those days.  And if this one doesn't pillage, from where cometh the food while marching elsewhere from Astapoor? They would have a supply train I would imagine, like most medieval armies.

You go for the kill, and that's it.

1605	Exitao	2013-04-23	Exactly. Why use a phalanx formation when you outnumber your opponents 100 to 1? You go for the kill, and that's it.Why?  Because you lose less men.  Locking shields with your group ensured quick and easy kills.  Just like today's tactics employ movement with covering fire, in which you'd be an idiot to go running out without it, when fighting with spear and shield against men with swords, you're an idiot if you don't lock shields with your squad or section, even if you are only one rank deep.Soldiers aren't Knights, soldiering is work.  It's hard and dangerous work.   When you risk your own life unduly you weaken your own forces.  Knights fight to win glory and honours while soldiers fight for the men beside them and because it's their job.You know the saw about there being old soldiers and bold soldiers?  You wouldn't get to be an old soldier by not fighting in formation.From both the show and the books, these are supposed to be Unsullied, who's lives are about discipline and obedience. They've lived lives that sound like they should be able to give Spartans a run for their money.  I can't imagine why they wouldn't fight in a formation even if their groups were only 3 men strong.  It would be unnatural not to lock shields.
1606	Peptalk	2013-04-23	It was great, but the extras that posed as the slave masters were plain crap. They kept walking as if nothing happened when she had already started to shout in Valyrian and when everybody else were completely focused on her. Anyone would have noticed something was up and they acted as if nothing happened. As minor a detail as it is, it ruins the scene somewhat for me.
That aside I thought it was very well done.

It would be unnatural not to lock shields.To me, it looked like they chose not to hold formation, since they were THAT numerically superior. And it looked like they were actually surrounding their opponents, thus using a different tactic. I don't think it would have been so hard to tell them "hey lads, in this scene you will kill everyone, while locking shields", so i think it was a deliberate choice.
1608	Its Not So Littlefinger	2013-04-23	To everyone:Sure, sorry but no.  I refuse to believe that any slaver could be so willfully blind to the idea that a buyer, particularly one from outside the regular paradigm, would ever try to cross them.  It defies my suspension of belief.Like I said, I'm totally willing to buy into the idea that they wouldn't understand a dragon can't be sold.  I'm also willing to buy the idea that they underestimate Dany (they clearly do).  And, sure, I'm willing to buy that Unsullied can't be trained to NOT obey whatever order their master gives me.  And of course I'm willing to buy that they would do just about anything for a dragon.What I'm not willing to buy is that would not always have enough other soldiers/slave soldiers on hand to properly defend the city.  As is, its like a gun store owner selling a gun and bullets to someone, and not having a shotgun behind the counter in case the customer gets any ideas.Gun salesmen usually aren't allowed to sell bullets to someone immediately after or while someone's purchasing a firearm, for that reason.Pretty sure its suspension of "disbelief" and you are definitely allowed to buy bullets when you buy a gun.......
1609	BlackTalon	2013-04-23	Pretty much. Scene was cringe worthy....Would've rather had something that didn't look so poorly executed than the 20 second cgi shot of the dragons and the army at the end.Maybe you should just stick with Harry Potter
1610	Lady Sansa Stark	2013-04-23	As much as I despise Daenerys Targaryen in the books and the show, the Dracarys-scene is still awesome. No one could deny that, right?
1611	Dragonstoned	2013-04-23	The actors playing the Unsullied clearly weren't very good at fighting that way.  Training a group (of extras?) to do well enough for one scene appears to have been beyond them, perhaps for budget or time constraints.  How could they do the rest of the city?I was thinking just a few shots of them running down alleyways and putting down slavers / freeing slaves from houses, in accordance with Dany's orders.  Don't think it had to be much.
1612	shiola	2013-04-23	Kraznys and Viserys are currently in an all-out brawl for the Most Violently, Suicidally Stupid Character Award. Who will win!?Joffrey.

Don't think it had to be much.The scene was great, if somewhat white-washed.  To be true to the book, the Unsullied would have been putting 12 year old boys to the sword, along with most of the adult males in the city.
1615	Versiroth	2013-04-23	Fixing  Crows and Dragons is the biggest mystery , if they get to season 5.George has the rest of this year and all of next to finish Winds and I am thinking S5 is going to be heavily dependent on Winds.If season 3 and 4 will primarily consist of the events in Storm of Swords (which has been confirmed), how in the world would season 5 depend on Winds of Winter?  More likely, Winds of Winters plot lines won't come into affect until season 7.    I fully expect Seasons 5 and 6 to portray Feast and Dance simultaneously.As long as people keep watching, this series will likely run for 10 seasons at least.   If I had to make a guess...1 = book 12 = book 23 = book 34 = book 35 = books 4 and 56 = books 4 and 57 = Books 5 and 68 = Book 69 = Book 6 and 710 = Book 7

I fully expect Seasons 5 and 6 to portray Feast and Dance simultaneously.I don't think anyone is suggesting Season 5 content will have significant TWOW material. Rather, D+D knowing what GRRM plans for some of the characters would presumably affect how the show either portrays and/or changes the storyline for certain characters. It's a bit of the butterfly effect. IE., you can't kill of character X in season 5 if it turns out that they will play a crucial role not easily substituted by another character by the time TWOW rolls around.

Plus,  I'm sure Martin won't want his ending spoiled by the show.   Stretching it out to 10 years will not only give the adaptation more time to squeeze in all of the good details, but it would also give GRRM plenty of time to release the next two books.  Well, as long as he releases each within the next 6 or 7 years.  He's already had a couple years to work on Wind, so here's hoping he can pull it off.Personally, I think 10 years for the whole of the series would be perfect.  Anything short of that will likely result in a lot of cut/rushed story lines.

1621	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-23	I'm really surprised people are actually complaining about THIS scene and I'm all for criticism!

1622	GoldenFleece	2013-04-23	The reaction from the public from this scene has been phenomenal.  People declaring there love and devotion to her.  I think Daenerys Targaryan has just tapped into pop culture legend.

really liked how danny pronounced dracarys!
1630	Broken Fox	2013-04-23	It was a badass scene. But in general this is how I feel about Daenerys http://d24w6bsrhbeh9...541774_700b.jpg

1632	Vovea	2013-04-23	The whole episode was brilliant but this scene... THIS SCENE. I was down on Dany's scenes this series but this has slapped me out of my stupidity. It's hit the top spot of my favorite moments list and I'm right back to being incredibly excited about the show. Emelia Clarke remembering those Valyrian lines gets some kudos and her deliverer of 'Dracarys' gets some more.

1634	Newstar	2013-04-23	Gah, so awesome! Loved the High Valyrian as well.
1635	PrincessOfDragonstone	2013-04-23	Rewatched that scene probably 10 times by now. Emilia Clarke speaking Valyrian was top notch. Props to her for the accent and memorization. The entire sequence was so well executed, music, dialogue, action, Jorah's face the entire time. And the last shot of the army marching out with the dragons flying overhead. (I know the cgi budget is tight but I would like to see more of Rhaegal and Viserion, not just Drogon). And I'm glad they inserted Kraznys actually hearing her speak Valyrian and realizing he screwed up, I felt we were denied that pleasure in the book before he got his face melted off.
1636	lil_z	2013-04-23	Emilia was great, the looks on everyone's faces when she spoke were great, the visuals were great, and the music was great.  It was great.Except...The underlying premise was really stupid.  It always felt to me like GRRM made the slavers unbelievably stupid so that Dany could get her army, and that translated right over to the show.  Why don't they train the Unsullied to never be able to kill an Astapor slaver.  And if that's not possible, why would they ever agree to sell their entire army?  I know they have "dragon envy" or whatever, but I can't believe they would be so shortsighted.  Them not understanding the nature of a dragon?  That makes sense.  Them not understanding that someone might try ordering bought Unsullied to attack them?  That doesn't.I didn't like the chapter, and I didn't much like the scene.  I was really hoping D&D would change the scene a bit, maybe show that the slavers do have quite a lot of soldiers (and not just a handful of guards) and have the Unsullied really have to fight it out a bit.So, as is, it was very pretty nonsense.  Sorry.Well in the books, it's been a few months since I read ADWD but I believe it's mentioned at Yunkai why the slavers bay free cities don't have large armies and felt safe. I believe it had to do with the dothraki. If their only enemy were the dothraki and they could easily paid off. The slavers bay free cities enjoyed profitable slave trade with one another and suffered no threats. Generations of oppulance and peace made them all complacent. But I can't recall were that explination came from. It was either Jorah to Dany, or Tyrion to the red priest.Also both the books and show played up how little the slavers thought of Dany. Up until this point Dany and her brother were considered beggars. It makes sense that a slaver would both underestimate Dany when he thought she'd never part with a Dragon and all of her possessions would only make a very minor purchase of the unsullied.I think it's very plausable their reaction. But I think you'd need the books to characterize why.I also thought the books showed the slavers to be  group of slave merchants who were all in attendance with one spokes person. I thought the book scene with the blood-bath of Astaporr started with several fat, rich, pompous slave merchants sitting under a cloth pavilion on cusions. They had to combine all their unsullied stock because Dany demands it. The show of oppulance of rich, cruel masters burned alive on their cushioned and shaded seats would have made a stronger scene. Just my thoughts though.
1637	shiola	2013-04-23	even the blackwater, by far the best of their efforts, looked like 30 guys storming a castle. And this is the part where I stop taking you seriously.  There were hundreds of people fighting Blackwater.
1638	Spring Snow	2013-04-23	That's okay. I've watched it 3 times already, plan to watch again in the next day or so. So awesome. Still getting goosebumps.Twice here, probably going to watch it again tonight. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> It was a very, very good scene.
1639	Bolton's Bastard	2013-04-23	Daenerys was on fire in that scene. Very powerful. I kind of wish she would speak in her native tongue all the time, she comes off as a better actress..or perhaps at least more interesting. Though just seeing her catches enough of my interest I suppose.
1640	lil_z	2013-04-23	that scene was epically bad ass.....as soon as she adressed the unsullied in Valaryian....the slavers knew they were in for a shit storm.....call me crazy but Valaryan sounds almost like a sort of Romanian .....Call me crazy, but when the slaver said "Kill her..." several times I was reminded of the scene in "The Mummy Returns" were the mummy orders the egyptian soldiers to attack. It does remind a bit of the language they use.I couldn't find that exact scene but the link shows kind of what I'm talking about.http://www.youtube.c...h?v=u3XXKF0oDtU
1641	Reposado	2013-04-23	And this is the part where I stop taking you seriously.  There were hundreds of people fighting Blackwater.Wellperhaps there was a bit of hyperbole but it did not look like a massive battle. Stannis was on the ramparts.
1642	Melonica Stormborn	2013-04-23	That was an epic scene. Watched it twice and it gave me goosebumps. Hands down it's currently the best scene of the season. D&D must really like Dany. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
If I remember correctly, there were some mention in the books about the bottleneck caused by that many Unsullied marching + camp followers, I just don't remember it very clearly. I'm not a Dany fan, although she has undeniably great moments. Oh, and Emilia Clarke rocked High Valyrian, her acting did look better when she was delivering lines in High Valyrian /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
1643	Nobody of the canals	2013-04-24	A majority of Dany's arc in season 1 had dialogues in Dothraki. Now that they've revealed that Dany can speak Valyrian (and it sounds awesome!), will that be the primary language of communication from here on out? 
Also, I'm not sure I remember correctly; do Mormont and Selmy speak/understand Valyrian? I think it was Jorah who advised Dany to pretend to not understand Valyrian in the books - but I don't remember if he spoke it himself.
Barristan Selmy at least communicates with the Shavepate in Meereen without anyone around to translate, was that in Valyrian or does the Shavepate speak the Common Tongue?
The looks on both their faces in the show when Dany could signal either way (I mean they could have just turned around to see what Dany was up to, not necessarily surprised that she spoke Valyrian) - I'd like to hear Iain Glen speak Valyrian very much though!

I think it was Jorah who advised Dany to pretend to not understand Valyrian in the books - but I don't remember if he spoke it himself.Barristan Selmy at least communicates with the Shavepate in Meereen without anyone around to translate, was that in Valyrian or does the Shavepate speak the Common Tongue?The looks on both their faces in the show when Dany could signal either way (I mean they could have just turned around to see what Dany was up to, not necessarily surprised that she spoke Valyrian) - I'd like to hear Iain Glen speak Valyrian very much though!In the books GRRM writes that Jorah does understand a lot of Low Valyrian , he has been on the run for a long time in the free cities.I can't remember about Selmy , he was at court a long time and could have learned some before the rebellion.I complained about D and D having Jorah not advising Dany about using Valyrian, but D and D were smarter than me!When in E4 it came down to it, Dany was playing dumb for strategic purposes with much more impact than George did in the novel. D and D trumped GRRM there!
1645	Asch	2013-04-24	I loved the look between Jorah and Barristan so much. It would have been so awesome if the two of them could have stayed with Dany /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />

1646	Tone	2013-04-24	Just want to also say how impressive Emilia speaking Valyrian was. Like many others this was one of my favorite moments in the books and one I was very much looking forward to in Season 3. They did an amazing job!
Kudos to whoever worked on inventing the Valyrian language and major kudos to Emilia for her conviction while speaking it!
1647	Toxspecific	2013-04-24	I despise Dany's storyline and character arc in the books, but I could end up liking it in the series and this is a good way to start. Nice intense scene.
Although, now that I think about it, didn't Dany say "Kill everybody holding a whip!" while she herself was holding one? /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
1648	Woel	2013-04-24	no, I mean Valyrian Text in English lettershttp://www.dothraki....n-keliton-issa/A link to the blog of David Peterson, who created Dothraki, High Valyrian and Astapori Valyrian for the show. This is the post for today's episode, where he reveals the first substanitial amount of written High Valyrian! He does posts for each episode where he delves deeper into the languages he has created for the show. Read it, it's very interesting!
1649	HopeForSpring	2013-04-24	They have done such a killer job with the languages. Thanks for that. This was absolutely my favorite part of maybe the whole TV series! It is going to hurt that much more to see her struggle with trying to "do the right thing" by be a "rabbit" later on.
1650	jugdesh258	2013-04-24	Scene was the Art of the novel brought to life on screen.....  they have done it a few times in the series like the Riot scene and the Blackwater bay battle. 
I lean towards the book purist's view mostly just in discussion threads .....but am greatly satisfied in the series when they hit the mark like they did here
1651	Queen Regent	2013-04-24	I thought it was great... just as I pictured it while reading the book.
1652	lounger	2013-04-24	That's okay. I've watched it 3 times already, plan to watch again in the next day or so. So awesome. Still getting goosebumps.Add me to the list.  Have a '5 minute rewind' button the DVR remote.  Worked out perfectly to go back right at the end of the scene and watch it again - then again - then one more time to be sure it was as great as I thought.

And it's actually not 'they' but just one guy (David Peterson) who has created the languages, which in my opinion is very impressive.

Similar to how she said all men must die, but we are not men in an earlier ep.  They are really playing up the girl power stuff.Anyone know the name or where I can get the composition of the song for this scene.  It was bloody epic, especially as the dragon spit fire, music synced perfectly.

1661	Rhaenys Sand	2013-04-25	It was really awesome, and Clarke's acting skills have improved. But is it me, or did she seem more "loopy" in the books during that scene? I mean in the show they put her out as this awesome barbie badass hero pretty much erasing any flaw she has which I think is a shame, though I don't like her character, I do enjoy reading about her, but in the show she seems kind of Mary Sueish. All in all the scene was well done, but I don't like where they're going with her character and how they're making her so "perfect".
1662	Daske	2013-04-25	but I don't like where they're going with her character and how they're making her so "perfect".Don't see this. Agreed this was a big moment for her and she scored. Buts she's made plenty of big mistakes on the show before this scene and there will be plenty after.

Especially in the case of Jon Snow and Daenerys. They've turned Jon into an idiot and Dany is pure girl power.That said, the Dracarys scene doesn't fall under that category. That scene was just as badass in the books as it was in the show.

RE: The closing credit music, I'd say very good. The cliche over the past few years has been to use a certain orchestration for "serious" badass scenes. This would include a chorus, lots of thumping bass tones, and cymbals crashing. Think many of the LOTR fight scenes, fight scenes during some of the XMen movies, and others. The original piece that uses this orchestration is the "Oh Fortuna" movement from "Carmina Burana" by Carl Orff. The E304 closing credits definitely fits along this theme, but I like it in that it definitely spins things differently.

There was a time , if an action film did not have a score finished yet, they would use 'Oh Fortuna' for the trailer.(John Boorman even used it his film EXCALIBUR excessively, even when it didn't fit!) Even tho Orff used a medieval Latin poem for the 'lyrics' , the composition and orchestration seems to have some origins in the music of the Catholic Church. Though , in classical music, I know of nothing like it, almost like the Rite of Spring, seems to come from some other universe.Anyway , to me, I thought I heard a twist of Ennio Morricone in the male chorus injections, I could not make out what they were saying. Anyway Ramin Djawadi has written some outstanding music for the show, that closing music run behind the credits was a home run!

I again will say that I thought the Djawadi take on it worked really well.
1670	Alys Karstark	2013-04-25	Just a random observation right after the burning of Astapor:
When Dany's shadow was shown, she was holding the Harpy whip in such a way that she looks like she has a cock. With all the talk from Olenna and Cersei earlier in the episode that it seems unfair that leadership in their society is dominated by men, I see that shadow shot as a symbol that Dany has gained leadership of her own people.
However, later in the scene, Dany drops the whip into the ground. I see this act as either:
1) Dany losing her cock and being "one with the Unsullied". Remember that she used to be a bargaining chip as well to acquire an army. She knows what they've been through and would be a good leader for them.
2) Dany rejecting the notion of a male dominated society and proving that you don't need that phallic symbol to rule a kingdom. As with the books, Maester Aemon has stated that dragons are neither male or female anyway.

Driven home by the fact that the slave soldiers were trampling it after it was dropped.I seriously doubt D & D were going for Dany dropping a symbolic penis...

Well not anyone, but a lot of people. It's a common phrase.

1681	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-26	I think it was more of an impact in the show for Missandei not to know until then.

This was actually the first time I felt absolutely pumped since seeing the opening credits a little before GoT started to air.

It was like a "Hah, fuck you I'm with this badass now!"
1686	boojam	2013-04-26	What'd she do in Season 1 to clue she spoke HV?The lines she speaks to Kraznys are, almost, almost, the same as she spoke in Common Tongue at the end of S1E10.I admit it's subtle , but if you put two and two together, even tho the show does not identify what Kraznys is speaking, one can puzzle out Valyrian (well Low Valyrian).Dany then tells him Valyrian (actually High Valyrian) is her mother tongue, which being of Valyrian blood, it should be.Tho it is subtle , and I think D and D trumped GRRM's narrative in the first four episodes , because it gave us a double surprise.Maybe D and D were trying make up for season 2?I loved Emilia's poker faced death stare during this whole sequence.(I have to say , as in the books, Astapor is solid full of greedy dummies, no one in the books ever noticed that Dany looked so different, and in the books she even has more Valyrian defined features.)

1689	BenBamBoo	2013-04-27	I think its my favourite scene of the entire programme, all the way back to season 1.
It has surpassed the Blackwater and Jaime's brilliant scene in his cage last season. Superb acting, reacting and very well shot and edited.
1690	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-04-28	Every time I watch this scene I have the same reaction: Perfection!
1691	Sam2Sexy	2013-04-28	Best scene of the show.  And that includes all three seasons.  Epic.  Alex Graves did a superb job directing this very important scene in the story.
1692	TigerA	2013-04-29	Indeed the best scene yet through 2 1/2 seasons. E. Clarke nailed her portion, yet the reaction shots of all the characters, but especially of Missandei were what really made the scene. Almost seemed as though she was getting to take a step back from her former master when Daenerys finishes with her "Valyerian is my mother tounge" line just because she knew he was about to get FUBAR'd and she wanted out of the line of fire.
1693	FaHaZe	2013-04-30	DEAR GOD!!
Ok, so I haven't read the books (yet - started reading AGoT a few days ago) and I haven't watched any episode of season 3 yet (I'll save it all for after I get rid of my finals). Also, I usually don't like being spoiled, but having developed an addiction to ASOIAF and accidentally reading about some of the events that take place in the books (classic case of curiosity killing the cat - or in my case, the excitement of not knowing what will happen, who will survive), with all the praise surrounding this "Dracarys" scene, I said to myself WTH and went on youtube to see it. Since I didn't want to completely ruin the whole thing, I watched only the 1st half of it (until Kraznys is in flames).
What I can say is that I can't remember the last time I was so blown away. WOW! Just brilliant! It's sort of lame, but every time I watch this scene I get tears in my eyes and goosebumps like I've never experienced before. Probably because everything is pretty much perfect and works together so well, who knows? /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />
Emilia/Dany is exceptional in this one. Maybe it's the High Valyrian (which sounds amazing) or maybe she really enjoyed playing the scene, don't know, but she truly shines. This marks the first time I didn't find the "I am Daenerys Stormborn..." speech annoying. "Nyke Daenerys Jelmazmo hen Targario Lentrot..." sounds light-years more badass. And it made her 3862 times hotter. Emilia should forget English and consider switching to HV for good, she sounds so natural, like she's been speaking HV all her life (even when she screams!!). Dothraki didn't work THAT good for her. She was decent though. And when the "Slay the masters..." bit begins... /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' /> You don't wanna mess with THAT Dany.
Now I have to mention the other actors as well (Dan, Nathalie, Iain) - all incredible, their expressions of shock, surprise, desperation, admiration etc are perfect.
I really hope the rest of the scene is as good (just the thought that it could be even more epic makes my hair stand up)  OMG  /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' />   
I haven't watched the whole episode, true, but this scene alone is worthy of praise and awards. So far the peak of GOT and one of my favorite moments. The very definition of "epic" if you ask me.
1694	Direwolfsigil	2013-05-01	Is there anywhere i can find exactly what she says, in valyrian?
1695	Direwolfsigil	2013-05-01	What'd she do in Season 1 to clue she spoke HV?Jorah gives her the Languages and Histories of the seven kingdoms as a  wedding present.She had  2+ years to study that book.

Now what I'd like to know is: is there a sketch of High Valyrian grammar anywhere online? I'm guessing not yet, but I have to ask, because the hints in this blog entry are so tantalizing. Four genders? Some of the endings are clear enough (-n for 1st person singular, -atas and itis, with long vowels, for 2nd person plural imperative), but we want more! In particular, I'll be horribly disappointed if High Valyrian doesn't at the very least have a subjunctive. I've never recovered from the trauma of finding out that neither of Tolkien's elvish languages had one.

1699	Count Balerion	2013-05-03	You're welcome!
And: I got my wish. Valyrian does have a subjunctive, and it's automatically used in negative statements, so that "a dragon is not a slave" literally means something like "it is not the case that a dragon is a slave," if I understand correctly.
It also has a very cool way of saying "and," by lengthening the final vowel, so that "blood" is Acnogar, but "fire and blood" is perzys AcnogAcr.
1700	Gendels Children	2013-05-11	OMG wow that whole scene gave me chills
1701	Mark Antony	2013-05-15	Just realized the Kraznys is the same actor who played Tim Driscoll in Deadwood.
1702	bigbadVuk	2013-07-20	The scene is awesome, it is known.
BUT, I think they ruined the awesomeness of the scene by introducing dracarys too early (in that magician tower). When I read the book and this chapter, she had not yet instructed by saying dracarys. So when she went bat shit crazy and yelled dracarys and shit got real, I got the biggest hard on. I was literally laughing excitedly to myself. It was beyond awesome. Though in the book you know that she understands HV, but that didn't really ruin anything. But it probably made it more awesome for people only watching the show finding out she knows HV. But if they had saved dracarys for now, it would have been epicerer ( /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> ).
1703	99thin	2013-07-23	very useful information. thanks a lot for this.thanks99thin
1704	The Dragon & The Wolf	2013-08-22	This comment goes back to the fact that someone said they don't show the other 2 dragons enough... As awesome as this scene was, by far my fave from the season & deff one of the top of the series, i remember saying to myself too bad Irri & Jhiqui aren't there to loose Rhaegal & Viserion on the city as well haha
1705	NorthRemembers10	2013-07-30	My big question here is basically what happens to Dolorous Edd and Grenn when the Night's Watch rises up and kills Craster in Crasters cabin? You see a small park of Grenn going on to attack some fo the other Night's Watch folks and a small image of someone attacking Dolorous Edd, but after that nothing. Are we to assume they are dead? 
For book readers we know that they are suppose to be alive and well at Castle Black when Jon Snow returns. They were actually suppose to even beat Sam back to Castle Black.
So my question is just, did the show kill of Dolorous Edd and Grenn?
1706	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-04-22	I have a problem with this plot line. Because how can it be that presumably in Season 4 and beyond, that nobody knows where Sansa Stark is, (including Varys), if Varys and QoT knows that LF plotted to absond with her now. Wouldn't the Vale be the FIRST PLACE they would look when she disappears knowing LF's intentions.
The reason nobody suspected LF is because he never contacted her directly and nobody had any clue that he was interested in her.
1707	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	Yes and yes.  I hate the argument that its never explicitly stated that Varys or the Tyrells didnt know.  It was heavily insinuated and not everything has to be explicity stated in the text.
1708	juanml82	2013-04-22	Well, Varys may have his own reasons to avoid looking for Sansa. As for the QoT, we shall see. Maybe they do make a fake Sansa, so nobody suspects she's at the Vale? Maybe they pass her for dead?
1709	shiola	2013-04-22	I just have to cross my fingers and hope the show explains it.
1710	Lord of Netcong	2013-04-22	This is the biggest plot issue the show has.  With all the things that have been chagned this makes the least sense to me and could have the largest implications so far. No one should even have a clue where Sansa is. If people even suspected LF then the Vale would have been searched and it wasn't.
Tormund Giantsbane climbing the Wall with Jon is the other. He is key to Jon's story in other ways after the initial attack. If Tormund is in the party south of the wall then he would most likely be killed during the battle. Unless he finds a way to sneak back north during the chaos. If they don't do that they will have to change his/Jon's story more. 
The more I think about it, the more I think there won't be 2 attacks on the Wall like the books. It sounds like they are combining the battles. "Send your eagle over the wall each night. I will light a fire like the North's never seen."  This sounds like one big battle but who knows...that's season 4 anyway.
1711	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	Well, Varys may have his own reasons to avoid looking for Sansa. As for the QoT, we shall see. Maybe they do make a fake Sansa, so nobody suspects she's at the Vale? Maybe they pass her for dead?Who's they?  A fake Sansa would have to go the Ned route immediately, that's mighty dangerous when there is a real Sansa out there.
1712	Fredwin	2013-04-22	We don't know how this is going to play out. Sansa still has to marry Tyrion, etc. For all we know, Varys will assume LF's plot has failed and then Sansa disappears later on. Politically, Sansa's life is not worth much once Arya shows up alive anyways.
1713	juanml82	2013-04-22	By they I mean the show screenwriters. A fake Sansa instead of a fake Arya and not accused of the murder of Joffrey provides an alibi for none going straight to the Vale to question LF.
Or LF could produce a fake Alayne Stone to show to whoever the Iron Throne sends? It would be a close call, though. Or he just gets whoever is sent to investigate into his payroll - but that's also dangerous.
In any case, this are the things which, IMHO, prevent us book readers from being too spoiled. We know the general direction the plot is going, but there are still things creating us intrigue.
1714	shiola	2013-04-22	I was honestly kind of surprised that he got away with it in the books, so I'm not monumentally concerned about this new development..
1715	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	I really hate how they've handled Sansa/LF storyline. They've made LF a full on imbecile and everyone knows his plans? Ugh.
1716	Reposado	2013-04-22	This seems like an area that xould blow up. 
As of now it seems like a plotline where they felt theycould get good scenes out of, but when you add it up it doesnt work
1717	Janicia	2013-04-22	Book Littlefinger steals Sansa away, consolidates his position, and then starts spreading the rumor that she's with him in the Vale.  His plan doesn't rely on her secret being kept perfectly or forever.  I would guess that Varys always had a pretty good of where she was anyway, but she wasn't a priority to the Kings Landing folks at that point.  
They've simplified the subtle plotting that the books are full of, but I think it is forgivable.  Complex, subtle plots require a lot of time, and we have a lot of people carrying out their plots.  I think is better to keep the plotting, though in a simplified version across a bunch of characters, than to devote that time to giving one or two characters amazing trickiness.
1718	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2013-04-22	I don't see why they would care that Sansa disappeared because Joffrey will be dead, and the Tyrells' will care more about making sure that they are not implicated.  Having Sansa as the fall guy will work to their advantage.
1719	Butterknife	2013-04-22	Sansa's escape is convenient for scapegoating. But the problem is that Littlefinger is going to disappear and suddenly reappear in the Vale with a daughter at some point after Sansa's escape. If all of the keyplayers already KNOW the link between Littlefinger and Sansa.. None of the later events in the book would be allowed to happen. How they're going to spin this, I have no idea.
Maybe they won't have to explain it really, because Varys will be gone by the time this takes place and Cersei might not ever find out about the LF/Sansa plot. We never find out if the Queen of Thorns knows anyways since she is absent as well.. But it isn't really conceivable that Littlefinger would be allowed to get away with that lie if they know his 'daughter' is Sansa already.. Bleh..

1720	ShigellaSand	2013-04-23	But even in the books, does anyone really believe that Varys didn't know Littlefinger had an interest in Sansa? That the possibility crossed his mind? Varys plays his own game, and bringing Sansa back to KL doesn't seem to have been high on his list of priorities. And then he himself left town not too long after - and we don't know where he went or what he's doing...QoT, okay, that's new. Presumably.But what would she stand to gain by bringing Sansa back? Blame has already been firmly placed on Tyrion, so there's no need for another scapegoat. Tyrion is still alive, which means Sansa is still married, so there's no chance of marrying her off to Willas Loras. Maybe she thinks it's better to leave things as they are, having a fairly good sense of where Sansa is, than to tell the Lannisters and risk LF hiding her away where she won't so easily be found if there's need of her.
1721	Joyful Union	2013-04-23	I really hate how they've handled Sansa/LF storyline. They've made LF a full on imbecile and everyone knows his plans? Ugh.To be fair, the only people that know are two of the greatest schemers in the realm, and someone who was a witness. He's still an imbecile ofc.
1722	Aripyanfar	2013-04-23	I always got the feeling that Varys and Littlefinger knew pretty much everything that was going on, but that both of them were very PICKY about what they actually interfered with.  Because if they started to act upon everything going on around them, other people would notice them and take them out.  I always felt that I was only ever getting the tips of the iceburgs with those two in the books.  And both of them recognise what each other is doing, and are keeping an especially close eye on each other as dangerous schemers.  So I don't mind that the Show has made it overt that Varys is particularly interested in Littlefinger and is making inroads into knowing what Littlefinger is up to.  I'm not bothered that the show is deviating so much.  Season 2 reassured me that all the show deviations would still get around to the book pivotal plot points, even if it's via a different route.
1723	TomBadgerlock	2013-04-23	Littlefinger will come to Sansa in an episode soon and tell her that they are ready to leave to go to the Vale. At which point Sansa will reject him because she is happy enough to marry Loras and go to Highgarden. At which point Littlefinger will (probably off screen) tell Tywin and Tywin will arrange the marriage to Tyrion. Littlefinger then arranges Joffrey's death (possibly by telling a lie to Joffrey about Margaery, getting him to abuse her) and either implicates Sansa in it or fakes her death. Maybe Littlefinger's "fake" solution will be a fake dead body for Sansa. Could be Ros, even.
There's no reason to worry. It'll all work out well enough as it did in the books.
1724	Robb_Starkers	2013-04-23	Doesn't Varys disappear at the same time as Sansa? Or roughly at least. 
Also, why would the QoT help the Lannisters find Sansa?
It's all good in my head just now. Who knows though?
1725	Walder Waters	2013-04-23	Also, why would the QoT help the Lannisters find Sansa?Agreed. The QoT has no reason to help the Lannisters and Varys has his own plans. He does not need to tell Cersei. When you play the game keep attention on when to play a card and when not, it may be better to wait for a better moment.
1726	Mulled Wino	2013-04-23	Doesn't Varys disappear at the same time as Sansa? Or roughly at least. Also, why would the QoT help the Lannisters find Sansa?It's all good in my head just now. Who knows though?Varys was offerring god dragons to anyone who would find Sansa, so no.  That's not correct.QoT wouldnt try and find Sansa for the Lannisters, OBVIOUSLY.  She would find her for herself.  She's already removed Joff by this point.

1728	Mulled Wino	2013-04-23	The QoT and Varys may know where Sansa is, but do not share the information with the Lannisters.Seems highly unlikely, why let LF hold such a valuable chess piece?  Why just let him have the key to the North?  Why go aroud offerring ransoms?  Why try and get Sansa even at the PW?  We have to be able to make some logical inferrences via the text, even if its not explicitly stated.  Baelish certainly has the skills to pull it off.

Even if he does not want LF to control Sansa, but knows that she is in the Vale, there is still no need to tell Cersei. Varys would plot to get Sansa in his control without Cersei's knowing. He could reveal her whenever it deems him an advantage for his own plans.

1730	Lady Sansa Stark	2013-04-23	Everyone knew Littlefinger was interested in Sansa. Cersei in one of her chapters thinks about how Littlefinger offered to marry Sansa right after Lord Eddard Stark was beheaded. So, Cersei knows. Besides, lots of people know the history of Littlefinger and how he was interested in Catelyn..
1731	insertname	2013-04-23	Be patient. Yes, it might potentially blow up, but we'll see. There were other plots where I wondered how they were going to write themselves out of it, sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't work that well. I don't think we quite have enough info from the show to properly speculate.
1732	Walder Waters	2013-04-23	The existence of Alayne Stone may be unkown outside the Vale. Y mention a bastard daughter  who seems of no importance? And the Eyrie was very isolated with only few servants. So it would be difficult to get a spy in there.
1733	Mulled Wino	2013-04-23	Yes, but they would want to have Sansa for their own game, so even if Varys tries to find Sansa in the books after the PW there would be no need to tell Cersei that his quest was successful.Similar for the show.

He could reveal her whenever it deems him an advantage for his own plans.Obviously. Shadrach said Varys was ifferring gold dragons for her, not gold dragons for bringing her to the lannisters.  Key point being they would want sansa for themselves, not just to know Baelish had her because he can do whatever with her.

1734	eyeheartsansa	2013-04-23	The way I imagine this playing out:
Tywin gets wind of the plot to marry Sansa to Loras and hastily arranges the marriage to Tyrion.
LF discovers that Ros has been going through his books; he is angry with her and she somehow ends up with Ramsay (Tywin and Mr. Bolton are clearly pen pals at this point, so it's possible, at least TV-possible!).  Then he goes away to the Vayle.  He has to take extra care in proceeding with Sansa since his cover has been blown; enter Ser Dontos, whom viewers will remember from the opening scene of season 2.
QoT and Varys know what's up, but don't have the motivation to do much, since Sansa is officially a Lannister problem now.  And with everyone all up in arms over Joffrey's murder and Tyrion's trial, Sansa is the least of their worries.
In other words, there's still plenty of room for events to play out more or less like the books, with some minor variations (Loras instead of Willas; Ros instead of Jeyne Poole.)

This puts them in a position to plan out the PW, and LF learns about Ros's double agentness through QoT.  The only thing I am not sure of is why Varys would do nothing with the information, maybe he'll give hints to Pod or may cryptically give him the motivation to follow Brienne?
1737	StarkBlack21	2013-04-23	Why would ROS being given to the Bolton's? Ros is 30 years plus. No one is buying she is Sansa Stark. That whole fake Arya subplot was foolish in the book and unbelievable anyways. They are better off with giving Talisa to Ramsay, ash she is the King of the North's wife.

1738	Areo Speedwagon	2013-04-23	My issue is that they haven't shown us how dangerous he is, they've only told us.  Varys this episode, Ros and Varys last season.  We saw him betray Ned, but that really only shows he values power over anything.  The amount of he-who-must-not-be-named-i-ness speak they throw around when Varys and others talks about Littlefinger doesn't seem warranted as we've seen quite a few people value power over anything.  Is the fact that he came from nothing supposed to be proof that he has brains as well? 
But then again, I just remembered he did arragned the Tyrell alliance last season.  And the betrayal of Ned was a shrewd political move once you get past what he actually did.  I don't know.  I think his story line will be more more enjoyable for book readers on a second watch, once we know (and have hopefully accepted) what's been changed.  And seeing how well they did Danaery's scene, I'm kind of hopeful they'll dissapoint us/make us happy/surprise us with Littlefinger's story line.
1739	MercyTheBlindUglyLittleCat	2013-04-23	I'm fine with them knowing if it's handled well, and makes sense.
1740	eyeheartsansa	2013-04-23	Why would ROS being given to the Bolton's? Ros is 30 years plus. No one is buying she is Sansa Stark. That whole fake Arya subplot was foolish in the book and unbelievable anyways. They are better off with giving Talisa to Ramsay, ash she is the King of the North's wife.The Boltons love to flay people and their bastard likes to hunt girls like dogs, so who's going to say anything?  "Arya" would rarely be seen in public until the wedding at which point it will be too late.  Roose is already backed by the Iron Throne, who could give two shits about whether they have the real Arya.I agree Ros is too old, however.  But considering her prior rolls in the hay with Theon she just seems like a good candidate.
1741	ArabellaVidal	2013-04-25	This is just what I think as well about Ros, particularly with the Theon scenes in the first season. Ros will end up the Bastard of Bolton and this makes much more sense than that she will always be a high-falutin' prostitute who will always be in KL. Otherwise, her involvement with Varys against LF makes no sense if, in the world of GoT she never gets caught and never gets 'punished' unduly for a good deed.
1742	xRobbStarkx	2013-04-26	I think the scenes from the newest episode if anything give me hope that the writers have finally heeded the fans and decided to get rid of Ros.  Think about it, she is now in a perfect position to play the role of Dontos.  I picture either Varys advises her to go with Sansa or she is invited by LF to join him on the trip to the Vale.  When they get to the ship, she's confronted by LF who knows she's been consulting with Varys, sticks her through, then pushes her off the boat.  I think the usefulness of Ros to the show is just about over.  I don't see there being any way LF does not find out she's working with Varys and I know he's not going to be pleased with that.  Also the fans will be able to see LF is  a significant threat and is not one to be double crossed.  It would be the first time the fans have seen him kill, foreshadowing Lysa Arryn, and how he won't let anyone get between him and Sansa.
That people are speculating Ros will go to Ramsay Bolton in Arya/Jeyne's place?  What?  She looks nothing like Sansa or Arya, she is not around their same age at all.  There is no chance she would fool a single northern lord into thinking Ramsay legitimately married into Winterfell which is the only purpose of that union.  I can see the show putting some suspense into that part, "We have Arya", fans get all worried wondering how that happened then it is revealed that it isn't her, just another girl in her place.  They had Jeyne cast in an episode in the first season.  I don't know, if they sent Ros to Ramsay Bolton it would make no sense in my opinion.  I'm just hoping she isn't destined to be on the show for much longer.
1743	eyeheartsansa	2013-04-26	See my previous post.
 (viewers) wouldn't think they have Arya, because Arya will have her own stuff going on, with the Brotherhood and later in Bravos.
Fake Arya doesn't need to actually fool anyone for the reasons I mentioned - mainly:
- very few people will see her.
- the Boltons are feared for their cruel reputation - who's going to stop them?
- the Boltons are backed by the Iron Throne - who's going to stop them?
ETA:
It might make sense for Talisa, not Ros, to be passed off as fake Arya.  Whatever happens between her and Theon would also have meaning since she would be his only link to Robb's memory.  However, there are strong clues from the show that she is tight with the Lannisters, so it's questionable whether they would put her through all that (unless they don't know about some of Ramsay's hobbies).

It'll all work out well enough as it did in the books.I really like this "faking Sansa's death" idea. Plus, it concludes Ros' arc. LF can have her killed after he finds out she's been spying on him. This could work. However, it muddles up Brienne's arc
1745	xRobbStarkx	2013-04-26	See my previous post.(viewers) wouldn't think they have Arya, because Arya will have her own stuff going on, with the Brotherhood and later in Bravos.Fake Arya doesn't need to actually fool anyone for the reasons I mentioned - mainly:- very few people will see her.- the Boltons are feared for their cruel reputation - who's going to stop them?- the Boltons are backed by the Iron Throne - who's going to stop them?ETA:It might make sense for Talisa, not Ros, to be passed off as fake Arya.

Hopefully I didn't come over as rude in my previous post, just the "Ros as Arya" thing wouldn't work in my mind, not saying the show might not decide to go that direction.  The Bolton's cruel reputation and ties to the iron throne are not what is keeping them alive right now, it is the fact that there are more Freys/Boltons at Winterfell in ADWD than there are loyal northmen.  Dustin will flip, Ryswell will flip, Manderly is barely hiding his support for the Starks, and Whoresbane is stuck in a position where he can' t retaliate without the Freys killing the Greatjon.  No southern kingdom is sending their men up north to help Roose in winter, they are pretty much on their own. While B&W have taken some liberties with the shows, I'm hoping they don't send Ros or Talisa in Jeyne Poole's place.  Not saying it couldn't happen just hoping it doesn't.
1746	Versiroth	2013-04-26	It will all still work the same.   The only difference is, you now know more details of the reasoning.   Varys tells the Tyrells about LFs plans so they can stop him.   Peter tells the Lannisters of Varys and the Tyrells plans in order to keep Sansa in Kings Landing.  He then goes to the Eyrie and uses Dontos to communicate an escape with Sansa.   Once she escapes, he will have been gone for months at the Eyrie.
The only part they really added was Varys knowledge of the original plan, but Varys has his own plans as well.   Causing a war between Kings Landing and the Eyrie may hinder his plans to back the Targaryens.
1747	'96Buck	2013-04-26	Doesn't Varys disappear at the same time as Sansa? Or roughly at least.Also, why would the QoT help the Lannisters find Sansa?It's all good in my head just now. Who knows though?No, Varys disappears after he frees Tyrion and facilitates Tywin's murder.  He's openly around during Tyrion's trial.
1748	'96Buck	2013-04-26	Keeping in mind that Varys' actual interest is instability on the Iron Throne to facilitate the return of the Targaryen claimants, he's much happier with a missing Sansa that could be recovered (or not) at a time of his choosing.  If that keeps Littlefinger's anti-Lannister schemes active as well, so much the better.
1749	'96Buck	2013-04-26	It will all still work the same.   The only difference is, you now know more details of the reasoning.   Varys tells the Tyrells about LFs plans so they can stop him.

1750	Logodnica	2013-04-26	There will be less suspicion that LF has Sansa if he is gone from the city long before the PW and her disappearance. In the book he'd been gone for a while and was waiting on a boat for her to be brought to him. 
Varys and QoT assume both their plan and LFs has been foiled when Sansa is married to Tyron. Makes sense that they wouldn't suspect LF still has her after he's been gone for so long from the city
1751	Broxalar	2013-04-26	So I've been lurking these forums a monthish now, so hopefully I don't sound too much the fool in my thoughts.
(Done on an iPad, apologies for grammar)
Regarding Littlefinger, for some reason I think he has a partial alliance with the Tyrells, as he helped bring them to KL early on. He seems, to me, be a man of patience almost as great as Varys. I think before he's left he's set up the PW with the QoT, considering she's the one that puts Joff's death into motion. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the QoT knows his later plan to remove Sansa the same night.
When it comes to Ros either she's being baited, or she will be a triple agent and take over Dontos role by the time of the PW. Now either way I think he wants to leak information to Varys to set Sansa in motion as a piece of the game, as her role somewhat downgraded with the entrance of Marg, and only has significance after the RW. With Sansa getting married off, people will then assume her claim, though later on the lannisters weasel their own way to manipulate a claim for the Boltons with fake Arya.
In essence, I think that LF's ultimate plan was always to get her out during the PW during the chaos, as it's enough chaos to put major pieces of the game into chaos as well as lowering their guard on say Sansa. This all boils down to my assumption that QoT&LF conspired to end Joff. This also means that Varys is out of the loop, but I don't think that it hurts his plans all too much considering his motions after and by the end of Tyrions trial.
Let me know of any issues there might be, as its my first time here and I don't tend to construct theories on stuff terribly often. (And hi btw, I've enjoyed reading thoughts of people since I started glancing across this forum)
1752	Flower ID	2013-07-17	I agree the QoT probably was unaware of Sansa's quick departure after the PW, her only agenda was Margerys safety. I am caught off guard by LF telling Sansa about the QoT and her involvement in the kingslaying. Wonder how much of what LF tells Sansa is true.
1753	Patchface Targaryen	2013-04-29	This may have been mentioned somewhere else, but assuming 'boy' is Ramsay, Theon mentioned that he did not really kill Bran and Rickon. Now wouldnt this be major news to Ramsay?
As far as I know in the books he doesnt know they are still alive. If he did I think it would be a top priority to get them out of the picture. His marriage to "Arya Stark" would be useless if either boy ever turned up alive as Winterfell would be theirs and the North would most likely support them over the Boltons.
Maybe this was intentional to add some spice to the Bran storyline that really does not get very far from now until the end of ADWD, hell it may actually lead to Osha and Rickon going their separate way.
1754	Maester Murks	2013-05-02	Ramsay is aware of that in the books. After all it was him (disguised as Reek) who proposed killing the miller's boys instead.
1755	Gendels Children	2013-05-11	it is known...
1756	Ser Dermett Corbray	2013-04-24	Anyone else enjoy his brief appearance as the Night's Watch revolt instigator?"You are a bastard. A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard."He may have played a traitorous dick but I loved the delivery of that line. Fuck you Craster!Seems like a great actor. I remember him being pretty creepy in The Dark Knight Rises too.Wouldn't have minded seeing him given a meatier role, to be honest. A Frey or an Ironborn character in a later season, perhaps.
1757	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-26	I had more sympathy for him than I did in the book, at least, until he grabbed that woman. And yeah, he deserves a shout-out, 'cos he was totally badass. Whooaaa Gorman!

1758	tito5601	2013-04-26	now that i think of it he would made a great frey hes one of those guys that ppl love to dislike and everyone ahtes freys couldve been the guy to kill lady stark oh well, hes really good in this role too even if its a minor one
1759	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-26	He's too hot for a Frey.
1760	FattyPeon	2013-04-26	Hes too cool to be a Frey. Unless.. how old is Black Walder meant to be?
1761	Dove	2013-04-26	He did a great job. I'd like it if he stuck around and didn't just get Coldhands'd, but with him billed as a minor character like Karl I doubt it's meant to be.
1762	Damar	2013-04-26	I found it rather amusing a lot of reviewers just referred to him as 'Burn Gorman' instead of his character's name, because who cares.
1763	Nezzer	2013-04-26	I found it rather amusing a lot of reviewers just referred to him as 'Burn Gorman' instead of his character's name, because who cares.I think it's just because his character wasn't named and Burn Gorman is a well known actor.
1764	Slingingstones	2013-04-26	He was great in "Bleak House" a few years back too.  Great Character actor.
1765	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-26	I found it rather amusing a lot of reviewers just referred to him as 'Burn Gorman' instead of his character's name, because who cares.Because when your first name is Burn you can be known as nothing else.
1766	Carne	2013-04-27	I have a feeling Gorman and Rast will run into Sam and Gilly later in the season.
1767	Ser Dermett Corbray	2013-04-28	I have a feeling Gorman and Rast will run into Sam and Gilly later in the season.Not a bad shout. Wouldn't be surprised if one of them helps Sam belatedly earn his "Slayer" nickname.

1769	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-22	... then what about Daenerys and her dragons, who are basically the reason magic is on the rise again? I know I'm kicking in an open door by saying Varys could simply be lying, but could this also imply his reasoning for rather supporting 'Aegon' than Daenerys later on has something to do with Daeny's dragons...?
1770	Delmas	2013-04-22	I do not think it is widly known that the dragons cause magic to be more powerful.
As far as we know only the warlocks figured it out when Dany showed up on their doorstep.
1771	Greywolf2375	2013-04-22	I think this is one of the places where we see Varys putting his personal desire aside for the, what he views as, betterment of 7 Kingdoms.  I don't think that his being cut is a fabrication (as we have seen discussed before) nor do I see him really being a supporter of Aegon versus Dany.  What we may in the end find out is that he dislikes the "sorcerers" more so than magic itself.
1772	Buckwheat	2013-04-22	I believe that he despises magic, but I disagree with the opinion that the dragons are the reason why the magic is back. Rather, the dragons are back because the magic is.
Also, I agree with Greywolf that Varys might have a bigger dislike for sorcerers than magic itself.
1773	oakenhelm	2013-04-22	I think this is one of the places where we see Varys putting his personal desire aside for the, what he views as, betterment of 7 Kingdoms.  I don't think that his being cut is a fabrication (as we have seen discussed before) nor do I see him really being a supporter of Aegon versus Dany.  What we may in the end find out is that he dislikes the "sorcerers" more so than magic itself.Then what to make of his conversation with Tyrion before Blackwater about there being nowhere to hide if she arrives with dragons? Is he lying?
1774	Milcov	2013-04-22	Well Illyrio claims that he didn't expect Dany to survive the Dothraki so I think Dany has surprised them quite a lot. Then again I'm not sure how much to trust any of Illyrio, Varys, Littlefinger etc.
1775	Effie	2013-04-22	I wouldn't actually make the connection dragons = magic
I mean, yes, them coming back into the world strengthens magic (or the other way around, as Buckwheat pointed out), but I think there is a huge difference between dragons and red priests, sorcerers, etc.
1776	ShigellaSand	2013-04-22	It's also possible that for all they've been scheming together, Varys and Illyrio actually have different goals in mind. It wasn't Varys who gave Dany the dragon eggs. Targaryens in and of themselves haven't made things magic for a long time - why would Varys assume that that would suddenly change?
1777	BorhPT	2013-04-22	I believe that he despises magic, but I disagree with the opinion that the dragons are the reason why the magic is back. Rather, the dragons are back because the magic is.Also, I agree with Greywolf that Varys might have a bigger dislike for sorcerers than magic itself.thats a good point. what came first, the magic or the dragons? by reading the books i believed that the dragons had come first and they revitalized the magic around the world, but now that you say it, i think that it was kinda the opposite...maybe something awakened the magic again and luckily Daenerys stepped to the pyre when it was finally possible to hatch the eggs, because for what we know Targs have been doing it for so long and they all die with the fire. Maybe it's something in her blood or some spell that protects her, maybe the Lord of Light does it or maybe it was because of the human sacrifice she made.Now answering the topic, I don't think Varys was truly working with the objective of she becoming queen, I think he wants Aegon Targarien to be King
1778	bent branch	2013-04-23	There are two major (I think) changes to the story Varys tells Tyrion in the novels and the story Varys tells Tyrion in the show. The story from the books:â<U+0080><U+009C>One day at Myr, a certain man came to our folly. After the performance, he made an offer for me that my master found too tempting to refuse. I was in terror. I feared the man meant to use me as I had heard men used small boys, but in truth the only part of me had need of was my manhood. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a long, hooked blade, he sliced me root and stem, chanting all the while. I watched him burn my manly parts on a brazier. The flames turned blue, and I heard a voice answer his call, though I did not understand the words they spoke. â<U+0080>¦ Yet I still dream of that night, my lord. Not of the sorcerer, nor his blade, nor even the way my manhood shriveled as it burned. I dream of the voice. The voice from the flames. Was it a god, a demon, some conjurer's trick? I could not tell you, and I know all the tricks. All I can say for a certainty is that he called it, and it answered, and since that day I have hated magic and all those who practice it. If Lord Stannis is one such, I mean to see him dead.â<U+0080><U+009D>The story from the show (this is as accurate as I can make from watching on my tv and using my remote):As a boy I traveled with a troop of actors through the free cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer to tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I heard some men used little boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer. Not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god, a demon, a conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. Well, you can see why I was eager to aid you in your fight against Stannis and his red priestess. As symbolic revenge, of sorts.I have bolded the two sections that I think are very different between the two. The first is where Varys makes the claim he did not understand the words they spoke. This was left out of the tv version. I think this leaves a stronger impression that Varys actually learned something in that ritual and that is what haunts and drives Varys now. The second change is where Varys claims to know all the conjurer's tricks. This is a strong indication that, although Varys claims to hate magic and magic users, he is very knowledgeable about magic. It doesn't mean he uses magic, but he knows far more about the subject than is generally understood.
1779	thegreatwhitebear	2013-04-23	Personally, I think the others awakening after so long is what may have reintroduced magic back into the world.  If you look at the series of events, their presence was what we first find out about.  However I know that dragons until recently have only been extinct for what 150 yrs or so,  and that may have been only bc of the maesters at the citadel.
1780	victim	2013-04-23	How do we even know that Varys is helping Dany? He's helping Aegon VI at the moment and it's currently unknown if he's a Targaryen.
Awesome Oberyn Martell mentioned that Illyrio didn't think her and Viserys would survive the Dothraki, this implies that they were just trying to get them out of the way. They were successful enough with Viserys but even those guys couldn't predict that Dany and Drogo would fall in love.
1781	Lord Varys	2013-04-23	Varys does know and use all the non-magical tricks of disguise, he does not practice magic himself.
As to the importance of his hatred of magic:
My interpretation is that he is opposed to those who practice magic, not so much to magic as an abstract concept. He suffered from the hands of a sorcerer, just as Daenerys has (repeatedly), so they actually have something in common. Varys should know about the connection between magic and House Targaryen. This is not some occult lore, but rather well known among the educated people in both Essos and Westeros. Especially to someone who worked for a Targaryen king quite some time, and who continues to work with members of House Targaryen (Viserys/Daenerys, and Aegon VI), or uses the Targaryen name to his advantage.
Illyrio indicates that Dany's dragons changed the game. But he was the one who enabled this 'game changer' by giving Dany the eggs in the first place. Illyrio, Connington and the Golden Company wanted to use Dany's dragons to conquer Westeros. It would be stupid to conclude that Varys did not approve of this decision, nor is it impossible that Varys and Illyrio actually wanted Dany to hatch the eggs. If you think about it, they would never have told the Golden Company or Connington if they had reason to believe that Dany could pull this off...
So I don't see Varys opposed to magic per se, the way certain factions at the Citadel seem to be fighting magic.
1782	kevin1989	2013-04-23	As far as I know Ilyrio and Varys never truly suported Danny. Everything they did was to put Eagon on the throne, at least for Ilyrio.
1783	Buckwheat	2013-04-23	thats a good point. what came first, the magic or the dragons? by reading the books i believed that the dragons had come first and they revitalized the magic around the world, but now that you say it, i think that it was kinda the opposite...maybe something awakened the magic again and luckily Daenerys stepped to the pyre when it was finally possible to hatch the eggs, because for what we know Targs have been doing it for so long and they all die with the fire.

1784	Mulled Wino	2013-04-23	As far as I know Ilyrio and Varys never truly suported Danny. Everything they did was to put Eagon on the throne, at least for Ilyrio.Like sending her Belwas, Whitebeard  and trying to send her Aegon, Jon Con, and Tyrion?

1785	boojam	2013-04-23	Then what to make of his conversation with Tyrion before Blackwater about there being nowhere to hide if she arrives with dragons? Is he lying?Yes , was that in the book (books)?Now in that case he Varys seems to be talking about the installation of the Red God as Westeros's religion , so was Varys's problem with the religion of R'hllor. Thoros of Myr and  Melisandre of Asshai have done magic , but I will be darned if see how it's connected with Danny and the dragons.Seems some of this was being done before the dragons were even born.Do the followers of R'hllor want to establish a theocracy?Even in Essos where the 'Red' religion seems more popular the books have given no indication a state of religious rulers.The Red God religion seems divided , Melisandre want's these nutball sacrifices while Thoros is not into that at all.Then we have The Great Other which , it seems is R'hllor is to be at war with. The Coming of Winter and the Others seems seem on the road to attacking Westeros , but we don't know why the hell they want to do that.Melisandre seems to want Stanis to be the agent who stops The Great Other.She keeps telling him he is Azor Ahai reborn, but Azor Ahai, even tho he defeated the Others did not seem himself to be a supernatural being. It's all very confusing. In ADwD Dany has a very short segment where she thinks about religions and war and decides she does not want to be part of it. She in fact does not seem to be religious.I can't figure the  Illyrio-Varys thing , Illyrio seems to actually be helping Dany , while being in cahoots with Varys whose stance on Dany we really don't know. He may have passed the info that Ser Jorah used to save Dany's life from the poisoned wine.The whole thing is confusing as hell in the books because I don't think George is really interested in religion and his 'magic lite' seem to be both connected and not connected with religion!
1786	Dragonmaster	2013-04-23	I see two views here that might be combined.
Illyrio was supporting Aegon from the start (after all, he should be first in line right?) and wanted to get rid of Viserys and Dany to avoid possible conflicts and Targ loyalty being scattered. 
Now when Dany hatched her dragons, the whole game changes; at first she was not important at all since she was a shy little girl. Now she showed some leadership qualities and had the most powerfull card in hand. Sending Aegon to join Dany could make them bond and prevent later rivalry and she now had so much to add to Aegon's claim and education to significantly improve the chance of success for Aegon.
1787	mafalda	2013-04-23	In the show last season, they conveniently put in Pyat Pree saying that the warlock's magic is stronger because dragons have surfaced once again. GRRM told DD a lot about books 6 and 7 so I do think they are foreshadowing and revealing some things. If Varys truly does hate magic, all the more reason for him to support Aegon, who I personally believe to be the mummer's dragon and is not a real Targaryen. I don't think they added Vary's little quip about hating magic for no reason.
I also can't figure out the Illyrio-Varys relationship. Illyrio was the one who gave Dany the dragons eggs, wether or not he actually expected fr them to hatch, I have no clue.

If Illyrio and Vary's are such good friends have this mysterious conspiracy the small evidence is they are out to help the Targaryens , if Aegon is the real thing.Trying to figure this out will drive you crazy!
1789	chris999	2013-04-23	... then what about Daenerys and her dragons, who are basically the reason magic is on the rise again?

I think that he supports Aegon because it is possible that he could be a Blackfyre.
1790	Table8	2013-04-23	It's quite possible the initial plan was to marry Dany to Drogo to simply start a war with king Robert, hoping to destabilize the realm.  It doesn't seem that Varys ever really tried to help Dany.  He planted Jorah as a spy and actually carried out King Robert's assassination attempt that was only foiled because of Jorah's change of heart.  Most significantly, Viserys and Dany are technically irrelevant since Aegon's claim to the throne is stronger.  who cares what they do, all Aegon has to do is show up and the Dany and Viserys would have to step down.
But then the dragons were born and that was a game changer.  There is no way that Illyrio would have given away dragon eggs if he thought they would hatch.  Now Dany has super weapons and that changed the plan.  Perhaps at this point Illyrio and Varys have a disagreement on how to proceed.  From Illyrios POV, dragons only make it easier to get Aegon on the throne.  He wants to send Aegon to Dany so they would marry and together they could conquer Westeros.  
Meanwhile, Varys is not a fan of the return of dragons, which would keep true to his stated position of hating magic.  Perhaps Varys sent Tyrion to Aegon hoping that he could prevent Aegon from joining forces with Dany.  Meanwhile Varys is secretly working with the citadel to find a way to kill the dragons.  Perhaps he is the one who sent Jaqan H'gar to Oldtown...

It reminds of when I watch the show with my wife (a non-book reader) and she will ask me a lot of questions that I just don't have an answer for lol. I don't recall what Varys says about the dragons in the books. But I will add that I am a book reader that gives credence to the show. I really don't think the major things will changeVarys' view may hinge on whether he knows the manner in which they were hatched. I don't know that he does and I would love a correction on thatThe way I see the magic/religion thing is that magic and the supernatural is very real, but the characters assign their own labels and meanings behind them, that may or may not be correct. There may not actually be a Red God. Characters have just been able to find a way to tap into a supernatural power.

Were they given as a test to see if she would sell them?And if he did think they were going to hatch, how the hell would he know that? Is Illyrio so rich that he can afford to part with 3 eggs and let the chips fall where they may?
1793	lil_z	2013-04-23	I remain unconvinced of the arguments about dragon egg gift. Even just a precious objects, they seem excessive to me. Were they given as a test to see if she would sell them?And if he did think they were going to hatch, how the hell would he know that?Is Illyrio so rich that he can afford to part with 3 eggs and let the chips fall where they may?I'm pretty sure that the eggs were given as a way to cement his position as a supporter of the Targarian line. I know the author uses a lot of mideval europe traditions in his story. It's not uncommon for a someone giving an excessive gift to someone they see as a future ruler. Dany's marriage to Drogo certainly would give Illyrio reason to believe that one of the two siblings would one day sit on the Iron throne.I'm pretty sure he gave the eggs as a further gift to the cause and make him a firm supporter. He never could have known they would hatch, the eggs were an investment to a future ruler. I doubt he would have given them if he felt it was possible to hatch them.On the tennis match about Varys and his views on magic effecting his views on Dany I don't think that's the case. I'd have to agree that I think he doesn't like magicians rather than magic. It's mentioned in the extra's on the Season 2 DvD's that the Varlyrians found a way to use magic to gain command of dragons. So there is a strong link between dragons and magic.Also, they didn't make much of a deal about it, but in the book the red comet is discussed in greater detail. It's not hard to see Varys making a connection with the red comet, sailor stories of dragons, and stories of magic coming back.I also wonder about the magic link to the white walkers. It's just speculation but it makes me wonder why the white walkers suddenly woke up as Osha mentions to Maester Luwin in the first season. Is there a link?White walkers awakeDragon's returnPower of the Red Sorceress=magics return?

Would Varys work with them if he really hates people who practice magic?Has anybody read the chapter in ADwD where Arya is given her first assignment?All the FM skills she learns are 90% non-magical, hard work , hard conditioning (going blind for a while!), absorption of a certain philosophy (actually it's hard to say the FM are actually religious , they are not monotheists*, and the many faced god is not a form of pantheism , their philosophy seems almost Zen like.So Arya is taken to the 'Face Room' and something happens, she gets a new face.Here the weird part, if you read closely, to other people (I don't know about the FM), she has a different face.Yet , and it's explicit , its on the page, Arya realizes , to her perception, she still has her birth day face!She even wonders what kind of trick this is.I mean really , it in a paragraph , right there on the page, anyone explain that to me?*I think George goofed in CoK when he had Jaqen mention the Red God, if Japen is a real FM , from what Arya learns later the FM have the Many Faced God as their 'icon' , I can't say they actually worship him. GRRM never went back and changed this.

1798	boojam	2013-04-24	I remain unconvinced of the arguments about dragon egg gift. Even just a precious objects, they seem excessive to me. Were they given as a test to see if she would sell them?And if he did think they were going to hatch, how the hell would he know that? Is Illyrio so rich that he can afford to part with 3 eggs and let the chips fall where they may?Yeah I would say Illyrio is so rich he could afford to part with the eggs.How did he get the eggs in the first place? From whom did Illyrio get the eggs, what did they know about their nature?For 5000 years (5000 years!) the Valyrians were hatching and mastering dragons , how the hell did they do that?GRRM does not tell us.... so there is a chance someone with Valyrian heritage (even some of the blood of old Valyria) might hatch them , what purpose would they then serve Illyrio... part of the Illyrio-Varys conspiracy?
1799	Mulled Wino	2013-04-24	Euron had a dragons egg as well, maybe they're not as rare as implied.
1800	boojam	2013-04-24	Euron had a dragons egg as well, maybe they're not as rare as implied.'Had', yeah, and he supposedly threw it in the sea, if he ever had it!So we really don't know if he had one.He has , gave the 'Dragon Horn' to  Victarion to take to Meereen.Euron says the horn will make him a 'dragon binder' but he does not say why he knows that.That screwball horn may do something different.Euron is nuttier than a five dollar fruit cake.

1801	Inquisitor Glokta	2013-04-24	I do not think it is widly known that the dragons cause magic to be more powerful.As far as we know only the warlocks figured it out when Dany showed up on their doorstep.Quaithee points it out to Dany mid-ACOK, when she encounters the grifter fire-mage in Qaarth, so it is known.And since Varys deals in information he should Â´know
1802	episodenone	2013-04-24	No idea how anyone could think you would give Dragon Egg's to someone that you expect to be killed.  They are far too valuable.
Why not give her any other kind of gift and keep the eggs for Aegon?
For people like Varys and Illyrio to plot so long hard and for so long to give up something like Dragon eggs...
I think many of you take the words too literally that "they were surprised Dany and Drogo worked out" -- of course they were surprised -- doesn't meant they wanted it any other way.

1804	Winterz	2013-04-24	I believe that he despises magic, but I disagree with the opinion that the dragons are the reason why the magic is back. Rather, the dragons are back because the magic is.Also, I agree with Greywolf that Varys might have a bigger dislike for sorcerers than magic itself.There's always been magic in the world indeed, so I don't think the Dragons are back because of its return at all.I think Dragons have in fact enhanced magic to some extent. Look at Thoros, likely also Melisandre. In my own crazy theory I think the dragons might've balanced the pool between "Ice magic" and "Fire magic" (the one they enhanced)
1805	episodenone	2013-04-24	I thought exactly the same.Why would Varyio give Dany, whose supposed to die with the Dothraki, 3 dragon eggs.Why would they not give such a valueable gift to the young Aegon who is supposed to reconcer Westeros.It's just a case of overthinking things [which these books obviously give us no choice but to do]
1806	episodenone	2013-04-24	'Had', yeah, and he supposedly threw it in the sea, if he ever had it!So we really don't know if he had one.He has , gave the 'Dragon Horn' to  Victarion to take to Meereen.Euron says the horn will make him a 'dragon binder' but he does not say why he knows that.That screwball horn may do something different.Euron is nuttier than a five dollar fruit cake.If you go back as fr as The Hedge Knight series -- Dragon Eggs were a lot easier to come by it would seem -- and clearly at least some additional eggs are probably squirreled away here and there.
1807	bent branch	2013-04-24	*I think George goofed in CoK when he had Jaqen mention the Red God, if Japen is a real FM , from what Arya learns later the FM have the Many Faced God as their 'icon' , I can't say they actually worship him. GRRM never went back and changed this.I don't have an answer for your question, but I think the reason Jaqen uses the red god in this instance is that Arya saves them from a death by fire. So maybe not a mistake.As far as giving the dragon eggs to Dany, I think they gave them to Dany hoping she would hatch them. They did not give her the eggs knowing she could hatch them, rather it was a gamble they were taking. I think this is reflected in Illyrio saying he thought Dany would die out there. He didn't want her to die, he just thought it was a really long shot that their plans would work out.
1808	aWildlingontheIronThrone	2013-05-09	I'd like to know how the followers of Rh'llor feel about a Targ with dragons. ie. Would Mel abandon Stannis for Dany? If 'dragons are fire made flesh' and their god is a fire-god: wouldn't they revere dragons in some huge way?

1811	TheBastardofBluegrass	2013-04-21	I couldn't really hear the dialogue clearly, but did Theon say something to the effect of, "The only father I knew was beheaded in King's Landing?"
1812	teratomatastic	2013-04-21	I couldn't really hear the dialogue clearly, but did Theon say something to the effect of, "The only father I knew was beheaded in King's Landing?"Yup, I was watching with subtitles, that's exactly what he said.
1813	ServantOnIce	2013-04-21	"My father died in King's Landing"   awesome Theon . . Awesome Alfie Allen is Theon Greyjoy.
and "Boy" is definitely Ramsay Snow . .
1814	rcazzy	2013-04-21	Yup, I was watching with subtitles, that's exactly what he said.And it broke my heart.
1815	Nezzer	2013-04-21	Poor Theon indeed, but I loved seeing Ramsay's face when he showed his true colors. He was like a boy getting his Christmas gift /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
1816	teratomatastic	2013-04-21	And it broke my heart.Mine too.  God, the whole time I was like 'Stop being so endearing! I know what's going to happen to you!'.  And then it happened.  That bastard.
1817	Lady White Wolf	2013-04-21	What did the "boy" say when he brought Theon back? I missed it....
1818	ChrisSnow	2013-04-21	I personally loved the scene between these two this episode. As a reader of the books as well ( and a big fan of Theon), I love how DnD added the touches to make Theon sympathetic to the viewers that may not have read (ie: "My real father died in King's Landing..." "I chose wrong..." etc.)
It even made you feel worse for Theon when it was revealed that 'Boy' had led him into a trap. Man, and that evil look in his face too.
What did everyone else think?
(P.S: This is my first post, but I have lurked for a long while now. Feels good to finally get myself involved /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> )
1819	Nymeria's pup	2013-04-21	Wow that was some scene. I actually feel bad for Theon. It took me much longer in the books to feel bad for him. He realized he royally effed up, but now he is going to pay for it and then some.
1820	TheBastardofBluegrass	2013-04-21	Yeah, Alfie Allen might be the best actor of the whole series, I'm not trying to exaggerate, or be cute. Every Theon scene this season is such a bonus because in Storm of Swords there are no Theon chapters.
1821	Mark Antony	2013-04-21	Alfie was so amazing.
1822	Darth Pipes	2013-04-21	Ramsay looks like Evil Peeta Mellark but I think that works here.  His con here paid off with information about the fate of Bran and Rickon.
I was saying last week that Rod Serling on the Twilight Zone would describe what Theon is going through as act one of a nightmare.  Seeing that cross really drove home the recurring nightmare Theon is going through.
Alfie is terrific...he should have gotten an Emmy nomination last season.

1824	Capt Banjo	2013-04-21	I'm really enjoying this storyline so far. Ramsay is pyscho and Theon is putty in his hands. The way he talked Theon up and then got him thinking of his shortcomings was so cunning.

1826	Oakenfist	2013-04-21	Ramsay is truly sick. Even after all that he still hasn't identified to Theon his true identity and I bet that he doesn't until near the end of the season.
Also Theon (and show only watchers) must be extremely confused right now, but that storyline is supposed to be confusing.

1833	Darth Pipes	2013-04-21	In ADWD's, doesn't Theon think something along the lines about the Starks being his real family?

Boo Hoo.He let himself be talked into condoning killing two children to save face in a horrible situation. Yes, that was terrible. Don't forget, though, that he was a child who would have been killed by Ned Stark had Balon Greyjoy rebelled. That doesn't make it right, but there is some cultural relativity at play here.He also didn't burn down Winterfell ... did he say he did in that monologue? If so, that's not accurate. Maybe he just blames himself for it, assuming that the Ironborn did it. How on earth did he burn down Winterfell if he was knocked unconscious before it was burned?Pretty much everything about Theon's life is pathetic and pitiful and he deserves sympathy. I just can't even with the haters.
1835	adamsputnik	2013-04-21	Ramsay is supposed to have kind of a pudgy, bloodless face. Roose also doesn't really look quite like I imagined - the bloke portraying him reminds of Vladimir Putin more than anyone else!
I suppose it is probably difficult to turn up slightly chubby blokes with colourless eyes so they just went with whoever impressed for the Ramsay role. And you can't say he's not playing it well. That look in his eyes when he returned Theon to the dungeon was chilling.
1836	BananaSpice	2013-04-21	In ADWD's, doesn't Theon think something along the lines about the Starks being his real family?Yes, and Lady Dustin calls him out on it, too (that he wanted to be a Stark)

I just can't even with the haters.did I ever say he burned down winterfell?  His actions LEAD to that happening, but he also beheaded the men he once served with, and had two chidlren, killed.  Theon doesn't deserve sympathy.  He was taken away from a father, who is a diguisting peron.  He was given a good life, in Winterfell.  He was raised as a lord, right along side every Stark child, and was treated better then Jon Snow.  I don't see Jon, killing children, and betraying his family.  Theon is a pathetic person, who is desperatly seeking approval because of his own shortcomings.  He deserves everything that is coming to him, plain and simple.  Go watch the Stark children SCREAMING and CRYING as he beheaded Ser Rodrick, as he whacks and slices, and kicks his head off.  Go watch that and tell me he deserves any form of sympathy.  He was given everything... and threw it all away because he was jealouse of his sister.

Furthermore, to be raised knowing that if your father messes up that your only friend's father will in return take off your head.Furthermore, Theon wasn't better treated then Jon instead he remembers it being the other way or at least similar.Moreover, I am sure there are numerous children who are distressed by Robb's armies killing their fathers, brothers, and friends but we don't consider Robb deserving of brutal torture.
1841	Jslay427	2013-04-21	As The Theon Fanboi President I approved of this episode. Amazing scenes between Theon and "the boy". I never thought that the show could ever make Theon more sympathetic than the books. I was wrong.
1842	Randyll Tarly	2013-04-21	Poor Theon indeed, but I loved seeing Ramsay's face when he showed his true colors. He was like a boy getting his Christmas gift /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />That scene was worth the wait! Now time to see how the "boy" has his fun with Theon and every other idiot he comes around with.
1843	go joff go	2013-04-21	Alfie has to have the most expressive face ever. Loved my real father died and the way they mixed that up with his inferiority complex in comparison for Robb.
1844	LyannaStargaryen	2013-04-21	"My real father lost his head in King's Landing. I made a choice, and I chose wrong."-Theon GreyjoyI thought this was a really interesting turn for the show to take.  Theon just barely gets there in ADWD, and even then, its only when he thinks about Robb and how he should have been with him and died with him at the RW.But I didn't mind it.  They're making Theon repentant and sympathetic earlier, probably because he's going to be tortured into Reek all season and they want viewers to come to support him.  And Allen does a pretty good job of selling it: he's between two things, all his plans have gone awry, and he's finally realized that he made a terrible choice that's put him in his present predicament but was also wrong on its own merits (ie ordering the deaths of the miller's kids).Although with Theon thinking of Ned as a father and Catelyn knitting whatever-the-hell-those-were for little Jon Snow, the tv series is really playing up notions of family and blood and parents, even more than the books do.
1845	ebevan91	2013-04-21	In ADWD's, doesn't Theon think something along the lines about the Starks being his real family?I believe so, and he thought "I should've died beside Robb" or something like that. I really hope they include that line somehow when they get to it. Have him tell it to himself, someone else, a horse, a white walker, somebody.
1846	Frumpus	2013-04-21	This guy KILLED CHILDREN.  Burned down his home, and needlessly killed people who he onced help serve.  Fantastic human being?

That was Dagmar's doing (and Ramsay's in the books).
1847	BananaSpice	2013-04-21	Yeah, Theon was treated "well" as in he was comfortable, but he was also treated with distance and mistrust by everyone except Robb (and Ned kept his distance b/c he may have to kill him). The effect on the psychology of someone who is taken away from his family at 10 (8 in the show) and knows that he WILL be killed if his rebellious father rebells, well ... I mean, that would have a huge effect on you, right?
I just love how people glorify the Starks to the point of thinking they "saved" Theon from his "awful family" by taking him hostage.

Theon's one of the best characters in the book, and to write him off as "he deserves torture" (as if anyone deserves torture) is so asinine that it's not worth responding to.

It's sickening to watch how he's being brought to life and i'm impressed by Iwan's interpretation. I cannot express how much I feel for Theon it's heartbreaking. And I doubt many people will actually be sympathetic towards Ramsay as the show progresses he's waaaay to monstrous
1866	iheartseverus	2013-04-21	What I don't understand is why the writers would want the Boltons to know that Bran and Rickon aren't dead.To search for them?  Torture more people for info about them?  Who knows...
1867	Ampris	2013-04-21	LOL.  too little, too late.  He's only crying because his plan didn't work out.  Easy to regret when your past decissions didn't work out as you planned.  He's going to get, what he deserves.Sorry. No human being, real or fictional, should have to endure the kind of torture that Theon undergoes. It isn't just physical, it's mental too. I'm not a huge Theon fan but come on. The guy was an outcast in his "family" and then all he wanted was to impress his real father. I may not like what he did but I understand it, and saying he deserves torture is fucked up.
1868	Dove	2013-04-21	For some reason people seem to equate "it's kind of fucked up to wish that fate on anyone, even Ramsay himself" with "FUCK YEAH KILLING KIDS ROCKS you're totally absolved of your crimes now duder"
that's not what people think at all dude, it's just a matter of having an ounce of perspective + sympathy for someone who came from a very conflicted mindset in the first place suffering an extremely terrible fate

I hope Alfie Allen gets a nomination 'coz he did some really great thumbs-up scenes this season. And oh, he and Iwan Rheon have a good twisted chemistry (for bringing their book characters on screen, I mean).
1870	Ramsay Gimp	2013-04-21	The whole "your sister sent me to rescue you" thing is pissing me off. I like Iwan as Ramsay, but right now people think Yara is having men torture Theon, in the middle of the North. It's gotten to the point where I just spoil them on who "boy" is, and why he has Theon. It shouldn't be something that has to be "spoiled", anyway.In short, I just don't see why Ramsay's identity has to be a "surprise." The fake friendship thing was cool (though I thought it would be more twisted if Ramsay pretended to be another prisoner) but at this point the audience should know who exactly has Theon

The whole 'keep Ramsay a secret and Theon's torture incomprehensible' has just become... incomprehensible.  A mess rather than a mystery.  Viewers aren't asking 'who's doing this to Theon?'  Rather, they're asking WTF is any of this supposed to mean.'  Its not working, my 2 cents.
1874	Bolton's Bastard	2013-04-21	Love this storyline, but I'm hating it at the same time because Theon is one of my favorite characters.
Anyone catch Ramsay's accent change when he says "Put him back where he belongs" can't wait to hear him talk more in the Ramsay voice.
"fans of Ramsay have existed prior to the show, I've always "liked" or appreciated the villain that Ramsay is from a literary perspective, I have an odd interest with House Bolton even though they've done terrible things. Now, the tumblr crowd that romanticizes Ramsay and Theon is weird, but whatever. That's always bound to happen.
edit: also, Theon says to Ramsay that those men said his father knew of his being tortured. Was this during any of the scenes, or just something we're supposed to infer Theon heard off-screen?

The rest just assumed it was the ironborn.

1876	Dr. Pepper	2013-04-21	What I don't understand is why the writers would want the Boltons to know that Bran and Rickon aren't dead.In the books, Ramsay is the one who kills the miller's boys so he already knows Bran and Rickon escaped.  Later, in Dance, when Roose comes North, it's revealed that he knows as well.  Since they didn't have Ramsay last season, I assume this is there way of working that bit into the show....that the Boltons know the Stark boys are alive.
1877	Ramsay Gimp	2013-04-21	I thought the audience was led to believe that Balon had Theon tortured?Well, "Yara's man" is the one who led him back to the dungeon, so my friend and the people on TWOP think she is behind it (perhaps with Balon too). My parents are just confused. And I just don't see the purpose of all the obfuscation - they should have spent this time building up the aura of the Dreadfort and the Bastard (perhaps having "Boy" telling Theon all about Ramsay's evil exploits...hehehe)

1878	Darth Pipes	2013-04-21	I watched Season 1 before I read the books.  I liked Theon in Season 1 and they made him a little more sympathetic with scenes like pledging his sword to Robb and his feeling angry/hurt about Robb criticizing him for the way he saved Theon.  When I read the books, I couldn't get over how unlikeable he was although his storyline was compelling.  By ADWD's, I had definitely become a Theon fan again as his storyline was one of the best in all five books.  It was right for him to be punished for his crimes but I do think he has been punished for them.
1879	Ramsay Gimp	2013-04-21	I think it's to keep the Boltons from appearing too suspicious before Roose's betrayal so it comes as more of a shock.

The rest just assumed it was the ironborn.The RW should be a shock, but there should also be warning signs - red flags like there were in the books. Ramsay's antics in ACOK, Roose sending men to Duskendale and then claiming he didn't order it to Robb's face, Roose's convo with Jaime, Roose "hunting wolves" at the end of ACOK. Besides, torturing Theon doesn't really out the Boltons as "traitors" to the North.There were clear signs of Bolton evil and treachery - doesn't mean the RW can't still be shocking, since no one will be expecting that big of a betrayal.
1880	Darth Pipes	2013-04-21	I understand wanting to keep some of the mystery surrounding the Boltons for the non-Sullied TV viewers but Roose himself was revealed as a pretty bad guy going back to A Clash of Kings.
1881	Dove	2013-04-21	I wonder if they'll tell his name in his next appearance, or if they'll drag it out until we're on the cusp of the Red Wedding. There was a clip of Asha in a few of the trailers, so we'll probably see something from the ironborn soon that makes it clear that they have no part in Theon's predicament - something tells me they won't reveal him until after that, but that's just guessin'.Love this storyline, but I'm hating it at the same time because Theon is one of my favorite characters.Anyone catch Ramsay's accent change when he says "Put him back where he belongs" can't wait to hear him talk more in the Ramsay voice.The voice/accent change was great. From meek dude to creepy fuck in no time flat. I'm really looking forward to more of his stuff now that we've caught a glimpse at who he really is.
1882	Team Renlys Peach	2013-04-21	And here comes Ramsay with the sick lit up face and crazy eyes. String him up boys! Wow what an episode!
Regardless of what side one may be on(as well as what is trending online), this was one hell of a show.
Last episode had me hanging to see the crazy in Ramsay and how/when it would play out. It was just as fulfilling as "Dracarys" was tonight.
1883	Montey14	2013-04-21	We finally see that "boy"  betrays  Theon...but we're not formally introduced to Ramsey as Theon's tormentor. It is kind of dragging out too long....but I guess they had to play out the attempted escape without kiera.....and put Ramsey in her place...just like he thought ramsey was Reek in the book...I guess they have to make him think he's on his side at first.
1884	Eric Xayavong	2013-04-21	Well a friend of mine has spoiled the entire series for himself since season 1 lol. Although, he doesn't know how all the events are connected. He knows that the Frey's betray the Starks, but not the other houses involved. He was confused as to who was held Theon. I tell him spoilers anyways because he will look for them himself afterwards anyways. So when I told him it was the Bolton's holding Theon he asked, "But Roose doesn't tell Robb?" *Sudden realization and mind blown* I believe this is the effect they want for the red wedding, and only rewatching the series will connect the dots. Throwing many hints such as the cross and the little bastard line.I did hold back telling him who Boy was /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Alfie's scenes are great. *standing ovation*

1886	ExileOnDaytonStreet	2013-04-22	I have to disagree with a few criticisms of the Theon/"Boy" scenes and how much information is revealed in them, although I can see others have hit my main points for me here:It's important to not give away too much about who "Boy" is, since doing too much there would take away from the impact that the RW can have.  It doesn't matter how it was set up in the books (as much as many people who post here consider such a thought to be sacrilege), it matters how this plays out as part of serialized television.  This season will have people talking in a way that will make Ned's execution look like child's play (and that was a moment that, if it hadn't been based off of a pre-existing book, would've been one of the most bold and daring moves we'd ever seen in scripted television).All that said, the "flayed man" sigil that Bolton's men carry (it's been most prominently displayed by the Bolton bannermen that captured Jaime and Brienne) is echoed in the torture room, so you know that there are some subtle throwaways that will reward non-bookreaders when they look back on this on DVD.I'm glad people are enjoying this storyline.  Sure, by it's nature you have to invent scenes that technically aren't in the books, but for how much of nothing Theon's going to be doing for a few seasons, it's nice to keep him fresh on the viewer's minds.  My only complaint about this is the "character takes a journey to end up in the same spot" trope, which I dislike in any TV show (Lost was the worst with that one).Okay, my other complaint is that I wish they would've waited a few more episodes before bringing Theon back into the series. Episode 5 or 6 maybe.  As much as I like giving Theon more to do when adapting books that he's largely absent from, I liked the idea that there would be some suspense in wondering what happened to him post-Winterfell even more.Alfie Allen is great on this show, one of it's secret stars, and this episode was no exception.  Excellently played, and I think the writers have done well by Theon's inner turmoil.That shit-eating smirk on Iwan Rheon's face when he lit the torch was beautifully played.  He was well-cast for Ramsay, IMO.

1887	theREALjonsnow	2013-04-22	Ramsay & Theon are not at the Dreadfort but are at Deepwood Motte right?
1888	ExileOnDaytonStreet	2013-04-22	Ramsay & Theon are not at the Dreadfort but are at Deepwood Motte right?Not necessarily.  Clearly, Ramsay as pulling Theon's leg this whole time.
1889	Daenerys Must Die	2013-04-22	Ramsay & Theon are not at the Dreadfort but are at Deepwood Motte right?My assumption was they were at Dreadfort.. don't the Ironmen still hold Deepwood Motte until Stannis takes it? It's nowhere near Dreadfort obviously but about the same distance from Winterfell as the former - Theon has no clue where he is though so it's clearly just a ploy on Ramsay's part.
1890	Bayard	2013-04-22	I wonder if they'll tell his name in his next appearance, or if they'll drag it out until we're on the cusp of the Red Wedding. There was a clip of Asha in a few of the trailers, so we'll probably see something from the ironborn soon that makes it clear that they have no part in Theon's predicament - something tells me they won't reveal him until after that, but that's just guessin'.What I'm expecting: only one more scene of torture and Boy laughing at Theon in the next 3 episodes. Then, in episode 8 we have the first flayed finger... and in episode 9, Theon begs Boy to cut it off, and he reveals to be Ramsay Bolton, the same episode as the RW.
1891	Bolton's Bastard	2013-04-22	I can't wait for more Ramsay voice! Hes already so much more entertaining than the sloppy greasy nasty book Ramsay.My point was that his voice in that scene sounded more similar to how book Ramsay might sound.
1892	Ordos	2013-04-22	I have an observation: why did they not give Iwan Rheon a fat suit? Book Ramsay is fleshy and big boned as well as having long hair. 
And yeah I also want to hear his voice more. When will he say things like "Do it now before I nail your tongue to the wall!"?
1893	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-22	GAH I loved Ramsay's hyena grin at the end, and his eyeroll when he was fiddling with the gate.I have an observation: why did they not give Iwan Rheon a fat suit?

1894	hedgeknight001	2013-04-22	My wife, a non-reader, is now thoroughly confused. I must say, she has a point -- nobody can definitively say where Theon is and with whom he is interacting.
To begin the season, Theon has been captured, presumably by Northmen. He is being tortured in the dungeon of an unnamed keep.
A "boy" servant-type is being ordered around by one of the guards. "Boy" later helps Theon escape on the pretense that his sister has arranged the escape.
The guards ride after Theon, knock him off his horse and are about to rape & possibly kill him.
Boy, who has apparently followed everyone (guards & Theon) savesTheon by killing all five guards.
Boy takes Theon, ostensibly to Deepwood Motte, but has seemingly ridden back to the same keep.
Some questions:
1. Who is initially torturing Theon? (He surely would have recognized their standard.)
2. Who is in charge, either of the keep itself or just the guards?
3. How does Boy know that Theon has a sister?
4. Theon would understand where Deepwood Motte is, but if Boy is really bringing him back to the initial keep, would he not understand that he has simply been brought back there?
5. If Boy is Ramsay, will he not have to explain to someone where the bodies are, and upon their finding, would he not have to explain the arrows in them?

Was this during any of the scenes, or just something we're supposed to infer Theon heard off-screen?It's something that we're suppose to believe happened off screen.I guess the torture has Theon not thinking clearly. He was surrounded by Northerners, knocked unconscious by his own men. Is he suppose to believe that Master Luwin showed them the "secret passageways" out of the castle and they escaped to a castle that the Ironborne held?My wife, a non-reader, is now thoroughly confused. I must say, she has a point -- nobody can definitively say where Theon is and with whom he is interacting.I'm pretty sure that is how it is suppose to be at this point. Theon can't make sense of it either, if this were a chapter in Storm of Swords, we'd have no clue, because Theon has no clue and we're following along with his thoughts.I'm not saying whether it's a good idea to have it be this confusing but I can see the angle they're going for.Some questions:1. Who is initially torturing Theon? (He surely would have recognized their standard.)2. Who is in charge, either of the keep itself or just the guards?3. How does Boy know that Theon has a sister?4. Theon would understand where Deepwood Motte is, but if Boy is really bringing him back to the initial keep, would he not understand that he has simply been brought back there?5. If Boy is Ramsay, will he not have to explain to someone where the bodies are, and upon their finding, would he not have to explain the arrows in them?1. They aren't telling him who they are and they're not wearing any colors or standards. This is to mess with him.2. What?3. Master Luwin quizzes Bran on house words, most educated people in Westeros know who the major Lords are and their children. Arya claims she's from Maidenpool, then Barrowton.  I mean Robb knew how old Martin Lannister was and that he was Tywin Lannister's father's brother's great grandson. Knowing Theon Greyjoy has a sister Yara is not that hard to figure out.Also Yara has taken over Deepwood Moat, this information would spread through the North pretty quickly.4. Theon does not know where he is to begin with. What is strange is Deepwood Moat is about as far west in the North gets I thought, so I don't see how Theon can get there going east....5. Theon is a pretty good bowman, this would be know in the North, if not before the War of Five Kings then afterwards since he did ride South and fight along side Robb for a few battles before being an envoy to his Balon.

There are details like the fact that the torturers were wearing Ironborn armour, but there's contradicting details like the giant X (Bolton symbol) where Theon is tortured on. Boy tells Theon they're far from Pyke yet doesn't say they're in the North. I think its supposed to be deliberately confusing for viewers.

They are just trying to recreate the enigma of him for non-book readers before he is revealed in all his heinous depravity. And the whining that Theon is not in Book 3 and 4 is ridiculous the show could not do it all as a flashback in season 5, that would be absurd, better to get it in real time. Poor Theon. Agree with everybody else who has commended Alfie Allen, he has been amazing.

1899	Rhasgul	2013-04-22	I read here that a lot of people have lots of respect for Theon and suddenly see him as the good guy. Loads of readers actually have him as one of their fav characters.
I have to say I always kinda disliked him. Don't get me wrong, I liked his chapters and enjoyed the internal monologue very much. I disliked him as a person though. I understand he went through loads and had a hard time growing up as a hostage for the family that killed his brothers and such.
Still, he WAS treated in a humane way and was given everything he needed to grow up and more.
He showed his complete lack of decency whatsoever from the very start, urging to kill the direwolves, always keen on seeing pain and ultimately killing off the whole garrison that once raised and fed him. When he killed ser Rodrik I lost the last bit of respect I had for him. 
I'm not saying he deserves to be tortured the way he was and deserves all the pain, misery and mindfuck, but you won't hear me crying for "poor sexy Theon" as I see loads of people here do.
1900	Jorah the Explorer	2013-04-22	They're going much too fast with this.  The Theon sympathetic turn was the only good part of book five.  And how much torture and fake-escapes can they show after this?  After the Storm of Swords timeline is done they won't have any great material left for later seasons.  I hope they prove me wrong.
I suppose they could be taking a "we'll cross the weak bridge that is Feast and Dance when we come to it" approach.

1902	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-22	To be fair didn't they know that already in the books?  Seeing how Ramsey was the one who convinced Theon to kill the Miller's Children instead.Yeah at first I wasn't sure about them knowing but then i remembered Ramsay in  the books comes up with the whole killing the miller boys.While I did think that theon deserved to be punished severely for what he did, I feel like he got what he deserved and then some. Killing the dude may have been a mercy compared to being ramsay's reek.
1903	Lady of Shalott	2013-04-22	What confuses me is, has Theon never seen Deepwood Motte and/or the Dreadfort? It seems to me that they have pretty different architecture. Wouldn't he realize that the place he's taken to is not where his sister is supposed to be?

1908	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-22	What confuses me is, has Theon never seen Deepwood Motte and/or the Dreadfort? It seems to me that they have pretty different architecture. Wouldn't he realize that the place he's taken to is not where his sister is supposed to be?I don't see why he would travel to any of those places.
1909	Rhoynar	2013-04-22	Boy's crazy look was very Ramsay-esque.[img]http://i38.tinypic.com/548xtc.png[/img]

1910	TheDarkOne	2013-04-22	Much of the story line involving Theon has been to sanitized for my liking. Theon needs to be tortured, gelded, and mentally abused to no end as we get to enjoy in the books. It's been far to gentle so far. Next week hopefully some fingers get clipped off.
1911	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-22	Much of the story line involving Theon has been to sanitized for my liking. Theon needs to be tortured, gelded, and mentally abused to no end as we get to enjoy in the books. It's been far to gentle so far. Next week hopefully some fingers get clipped off.we'll probably get the flaying first, i think theon says that the flaying hurts so bad he begged Ramsay to cut the finger off. I'm not sure if that was actually during the flaying or later on though.Besides we have  a season and a half for him to get mentally and physically broken down, plenty of time.
1912	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-22	Saw this picture and had to laugh.
1913	Lord_Ravenstone	2013-04-22	Ramsay has to send Bolton and Catelyn a piece of Theon's flayed skin before the RW.
1914	Joyful Union	2013-04-22	Much of the story line involving Theon has been to sanitized for my liking. Theon needs to be tortured, gelded, and mentally abused to no end as we get to enjoy in the books. It's been far to gentle so far. Next week hopefully some fingers get clipped off.It looks like he's being psychologically broken first. His physical breakdown will probably come soon.
1915	The Flaying Man	2013-04-22	Arguing with Theon haters is a waste of time.  If they don't understand the culture differences between modern countries today and Westeros, and if they can't look at it from Theon's perspective, then they'll never change.  It's like arguing with a wall.Theon's one of the best characters in the book, and to write him off as "he deserves torture" (as if anyone deserves torture) is so asinine that it's not worth responding to.Great post.
1916	a shadow	2013-04-22	I did not really like Theon sniffing again with how bad he has it, and to the first stranger who would listen /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
Maybe it was for the viewers, who forgot the first twelve times that happened.
1917	Bolton's Bastard	2013-04-22	Why? In the books he definitely knew where he was. Not saying that it's bad because it's different than the books, I just think it's badly handled on its own.Well, to be fair, in the book he was backhanded by Ramsay and later, I assume, woke up in the Dreadfort. Here he was knocked out by his men and handed over so he wouldn't have any idea. The torturers were also wearing Ironborn uniform. Ramsay just fed him bogus info ("Ride east!") so he probably just rode a bit east of the Dreadfort, lost his bearings in the chase and Ramsay lead him back to the Dreadfort via a different route.
1918	sifth	2013-04-22	dam it Theon, I hate you. stop making me cry, ha ha ha
jokes aside it was an amazing scene I will admit. I really do feel bad for Theon and Cat on the tv show. Something I never felt while reading the books

1919	gibbles545	2013-04-22	i was a bit worried when we first met 'boy' because he was not pulling off a crazy or sadistic look at all, an he is obviously more handsome than book ramsay. But the look he gave theon as he was put back on the rack was very sinister and him being handsome may make it more shocking for none book readers so im slightly hopeful now.
1920	Delmas	2013-04-22	Love Theon but I thought the Boltons were unaware of the Starks boys being alive.
The fact that Theon told Ramsay about them(so quickly) makes Theon looks moronic and Ramsay look like Einstein imo
1921	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-22	Poor Theon indeed, but I loved seeing Ramsay's face when he showed his true colors. He was like a boy getting his Christmas gift /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />Haha you even put it was your avatar /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> Well played.The fact that Theon told Ramsay about them(so quickly) makes Theon looks moronic and Ramsay look like Einstein imoThat's nothing new... Theon has been turned into a complete moron in the show so far, while in the books he at least has his moments /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />

1922	-Ghost-	2013-04-22	Alfie is amazing. 
I called Ramsay just leading him in a circle back to the Dreadfort.
Ramsay's crazy face was great at the end!
1923	Delmas	2013-04-22	Can sum1 confirm for me plz the boltons know about the stark children in the books?
I had been under the impression they had not.
1924	-Ghost-	2013-04-22	Can sum1 confirm for me plz the boltons know about the stark children in the books?I had been under the impression they had not.It was Ramsays idea in the book to use the millers boys. He was Reek.
1925	GeorgeIAF	2013-04-22	Given the fact that in the books it was Ramsay who suggested the killing of Miller's boys instead of the Sarks, it's pretty much obvious that he knows that they arent dead. Also in a DWD there are chapters, if i remember correctly, where it is implied that the Boltons know about Bran and Rickon.
1926	Delmas	2013-04-22	Given the fact that in the books it was Ramsay who suggested the killing of Miller's boys instead of the Sarks, it's pretty much obvious that he knows that they arent dead.

He was Reek.Thanks guys, time to re-read! Book 2 I guess?
1927	BaseBornBastard	2013-04-22	So how the hell did Ramsay lead Theon back the way he came to his captors without Theon knowing?
1928	Jamie Lannister	2013-04-22	Great reveal.
But where will it go from here? The people who saw the screeners have only spoiled up to this exact point. Is this the end of Theon's arc for the season?
1929	Sun	2013-04-22	"My real father lost his head in King's Landing. I made a choice, and I chose wrong."-Theon GreyjoyThat line actually brought tears to my eyes. I have never felt sorry for Theon, but this line did allow me to momentarily empathize with him, for the first time. It was a nice line, well timed, and beautifully said by Alfie.

1930	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	Great reveal.But where will it go from here? The people who saw the screeners have only spoiled up to this exact point. Is this the end of Theon's arc for the season?I don't think so. IIRC, Alfie Allen appears in 6 episodes this season.
1931	Greywolf2375	2013-04-22	Some changes I don't like, this one I do - the mystery of not seeing him in the books for a while was ok. Here, being able to see part of what he is dealing with - very cool.
I'm still out on the "Ned was my father" line.  I like it, but I don't like it at the same time.  Need to see it again I think.
1932	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	.  His con here paid off with information about the fate of Bran and Rickon.I couldnt believe he fessed up pre-flaying.  But Ramsey pulled a supreme mindfuck.
1933	mystikherb	2013-04-22	I've been watching this season with two friends who have either not read the books or not finished clash of kings.  As soon as that Janitor looked up at Theon in the episode he was introduced, it was everything I could do not to scream at them about who that bastard was and the shit he will cause.  It was very exciting to see him give his first crazy-eye-look-thing of the show and reveal himself as the bastard he is and watch my friends react.  I'm excited to see how Iwan Rheon takes the role from here.
1934	mystikherb	2013-04-22	I don't think so. IIRC, Alfie Allen appears in 6 episodes this season.But he's only been in 3 so far, so his story's only about half way through this season.  There's still plenty of scenes left between him and Ramsay.
1935	Volantis	2013-04-22	What was the point of his con?
1936	Tywin's bastard	2013-04-22	Great reveal.But where will it go from here? The people who saw the screeners have only spoiled up to this exact point. Is this the end of Theon's arc for the season?I think the big part of the second part of this arc is to establish who Ramsay is, as well as Theon really starting to break.
1937	Tywin's bastard	2013-04-22	What was the point of his con?Giving Theon a real taste of freedom and hope after all that torture, which will surely be a big step to breaking him completely when it's all taken away and things get even worse.
1938	GeorgeIAF	2013-04-22	@basebornbastard He took him on a different route. I dont think it's the end of Theon's storyline, not at all, we will get to see more from the Bastard. Sadly, i think, after watching epispde 5 promo and 4's recap, that Theon wont be in it.
1939	Is He Dead Yet?	2013-04-22	I've got more sympathy for TV Theon - largely as a result of the 'My REal Father...' scene - than I did for Book Theon, although of course no-one deserves to be brutalised by T'Bastard of Bolton etc etc etc.
I am now waiting for the transformation from Theon Greyjoy to The Hapless Boy Reek.
1940	WhiteGuts	2013-04-22	They are going through Theon's stroyline very fast. The only storyline he has in the last 3 books. At one point or another, it WILL be a problem.
My guess is, we don't see Theon during season 4.
1941	Nomad/	2013-04-22	They are going through Theon's stroyline very fast. The only storyline he has in the last 3 books. At one point or another, it WILL be a problem.My guess is, we don't see Theon during season 4.Yeah, I think u are right. But the scenes are important for those, who dont read the books.
1942	Roose Seal	2013-04-22	They are going through Theon's stroyline very fast. The only storyline he has in the last 3 books. At one point or another, it WILL be a problem.My guess is, we don't see Theon during season 4.Actually, the Reek chapters at the beginning of DwD take place roughly around the end of SoS.Ramsay captures Theon at the end of CoK, and tortures him all throughout SoS, we just never see it in the books. Chronologically, Theon's storyline makes sense so far.
1943	BananaSpice	2013-04-22	Yeah, AFFC and ADWD plotlines will surely start by the end of season 4 ... I have no idea why people think "Theon is going to be tortured for 3 seasons" and all that nonsense. NO. The show is not the books ... things are going to move chronologically.
1944	Jamie Lannister	2013-04-22	I think the big part of the second part of this arc is to establish who Ramsay is, as well as Theon really starting to break.Yeah, hopefully. It would be nice if we have a name (specifically, a surname) to pin on "Boy" before the RW.
1945	Kernest	2013-04-22	In the books I didn't forgive Theon for what he did until after a second reading of Dance.
But after:
"The only father I knew was beheaded in King's Landing"
I teared up and wanted to hug him and whisper into his ear "It's okay, I forgive you"
Damn you Alfie Allen, you made me forgive a murdering bastard ahead of schedule.
1946	Imp Riker	2013-04-22	I thought it was a little early for Theon to come to the realization that betraying the Starks was a mistake, but it was very well done. Also, the actor playing Ramsay nailed his facial expressions. Downright terrifying.
1947	StarkTagaryen	2013-04-22	am i wrong to think "wow that's really sad for theon?"
1948	BananaSpice	2013-04-22	I thought it was a little early for Theon to come to the realization that betraying the Starks was a mistake, but it was very well done. Also, the actor playing Ramsay nailed his facial expressions. Downright terrifying.I don't think it was too early ... tbh, I think a lot of ppl don't give him enough credit and think he only regrets it b/c of Ramsay / torture ... but he seems to regret betraying the Starks in ACOK but he can't just back out after having gone so far (this is made very clear in the show). He feels guilty about killing the miller's/farmer's boys (he has nightmares about it ... plus nightmares about Robb). He is definitely already regretting his actions in ACOK - he even seriously considers taking the black.
1949	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2013-04-22	In the books I didn't forgive Theon for what he did until after a second reading of Dance.But after:"The only father I knew was beheaded in King's Landing"I teared up and wanted to hug him and whisper into his ear "It's okay, I forgive you"Damn you Alfie Allen, you made me forgive a murdering bastard ahead of schedule.Yeah I feel the same.The thing with the books is you are kind of supposed to hate Theon then at some point during the reveal of what had happened to him, you are supposed to question everything you thought about him. With the way its done here, his admission, and therefore a kind of redemption has already occurred.It might be different for viewers though. They might not forgive him yet because they don't know what is coming.
1950	lojzelote	2013-04-22	Arguing with Theon haters is a waste of time.  If they don't understand the culture differences between modern countries today and Westeros, and if they can't look at it from Theon's perspective, then they'll never change.  It's like arguing with a wall.Theon's one of the best characters in the book, and to write him off as "he deserves torture" (as if anyone deserves torture) is so asinine that it's not worth responding to.Yeah, peasant children's lives are worthless. Everybody should understand that. It was not Bran and Rickon, only some random boys who had killed while their mother watched. But yeah, with one thing I have to agree: torture is not the answer. Even after the Ramsay treatment, he still thinks that the lives of the miller's sons don't really count.
1951	BananaSpice	2013-04-22	Yeah, peasant children's lives are worthless. Everybody should understand that. It was not Bran and Rickon, only some random boys who had killed while their mother watched.But yeah, with one thing I have to agree: torture is not the answer. Even after the Ramsay treatment, he still thinks that the lives of the miller's sons don't really count.I don't think that's exactly accurate. He has nightmares after Ramsay/Reek killed/flayed the boys. He definitely feels some guilt and remorse over it. I think he harps on it "not being the Starks" b/c he's thinking he's "not a kinslayer" (which is a HUGE deal in the ASOIAF world) ... it's interesting, b/c THEON thinks he isn't a kinslayer b/c he didn't kill the Starks, but other ppl think he says that b/c he's not a Stark .... so he actually IS thinking of himself as a Stark.
1952	Crown	2013-04-22	'The only father I knew was beheaded in King's Landing.'Give Alfie an Emmy for that line. Perfect. He almost made me shed a manly tear.
1953	Nudu	2013-04-22	did I ever say he burned down winterfell?  His actions LEAD to that happening, but he also beheaded the men he once served with, and had two chidlren, killed.  Theon doesn't deserve sympathy.  He was taken away from a father, who is a diguisting peron.  He was given a good life, in Winterfell.  He was raised as a lord, right along side every Stark child, and was treated better then Jon Snow.  I don't see Jon, killing children, and betraying his family.  Theon is a pathetic person, who is desperatly seeking approval because of his own shortcomings.  He deserves everything that is coming to him, plain and simple.  Go watch the Stark children SCREAMING and CRYING as he beheaded Ser Rodrick, as he whacks and slices, and kicks his head off.  Go watch that and tell me he deserves any form of sympathy.  He was given everything... and threw it all away because he was jealouse of his sister. Mr. rodrick should have known he should not spit on his captor's face.
1954	BananaSpice	2013-04-22	I also think it's an important distinction that the awful things Theon does are always at the prodding of other people. No, that's not an excuse ... he is still culpable, but it does show that he isn't inherently evil. I mean, Joffrey and Ramsay and Gregor Clegane just LIKE to be violent and cruel ... nobody needs to encourage them to do so. Theon absolutely does not want to be cruel or evil. He wants to be a good leader. He TRIES to be a good leader ... he TRIES to be like Ned Stark ... he thinks about how he's protecting the North from the likes of "him" (i.e. Ramsay disguised as Reek when he encourages flaying and Theon refuses to allow torture/flaying while he's in charge). Theon also wrestles with the guilt as early as his ACOK chapters.  I'm just really not sure which books the haters have been reading, lol.
1955	Lord Martin	2013-04-22	So badass.
My theory is that Theon will be tortured for the rest of the season about the whereabouts of Bran and Rickon.  Theon obviously doesn't know and his lack of answers won't make his captors happy.  Then Ramsay Snow will be revealed as Roose's son right around the time of the RW.  My guess is one episode before so its a hint but not a big one.
Part of my theory is that Bran's story line is not detailed enough compared to many others.  Its just his band walking, walking and walking some more.  Doesn't make great TV.  My theory is that next season will be Ramsay and co hunting down Bran and Rickon... that might be what causes them to split up.  By that time, I expect Theon to be Ramsay's maimed lap dog.  
As for this whole "deserving torture" business "deserve" is a loaded word, what do any of us deserve?  The point isn't what does Theon deserve.  IMO, Martin makes his torture so awful just to test the reader's limits.
The point is, Theon MUST be tortured so he can be redeemed.
1956	Toxspecific	2013-04-22	Theon... That convo was so sad. Pretty darn heartbreaking. 'The only father I had, lost his head in King's Landing.' And what makes it sadder is that Ned did not, could not for his own sake, consider Theon a son.
Damn. Absolutely magnificent scene. Top class acting, and legendary characterization at work. I feel honoured to have watched that scene.
1957	Versiroth	2013-04-22	Honestly, reading the books, I never got how and why everyone started loving Jaime, because he still felt like a douche even while learning a little honor from Brienne.   But, I never had an issue finding pity for Wreak # 2.
1958	HouseHarrison	2013-04-22	The show is handling these Theon scenes great, I'm not sure they can keep it up for 2 or more seasons though until they hit ADWD. I wish that father confession scene was in the books.
And the look in Ramsay's eyes. Oh boy. That actor has it down.
1959	TheDarkOne	2013-04-22	Let's hope next week we actually get some real torture. What have we really seen so far? A toe and finger poke?
I wouldn't be surprised if Theon being castrated is toward the end of the season.
1960	Son of Gendry	2013-04-22	To be fair didn't they know that already in the books?  Seeing how Ramsey was the one who convinced Theon to kill the Miller's Children instead.Thank you! I was wondering the same thing.
1961	Winterz	2013-04-22	I couldn't really hear the dialogue clearly, but did Theon say something to the effect of, "The only father I knew was beheaded in King's Landing?"This, heart breaking indeed. Unlike in the books this Theon is more easy for us to forgive. I mean in the show, Dagmer had quite the grip on him and influenced his every act. Hopefully they'll show us Dagmer flayed /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
1962	Versiroth	2013-04-22	I just rewatched the scene and honestly, I think that they're just setting up the fact that Ramsey is vile and cruel.     He got off on other people's pain in the books and this was just the first taste of what he's like to the non-book readers.    They'll get who he really is eventually and also that Theon's pain and suffering has only just begun.    The fact that Theon made some heart felt and apologetic revelations this episode will only deepen the sorrow the audience will feel as he's tortured and broken.
1963	Dove	2013-04-22	Theon... That convo was so sad. Pretty darn heartbreaking. 'The only father I had, lost his head in King's Landing.' And what makes it sadder is that Ned did not, could not for his own sake, consider Theon a son.Yeah, that's what hit me about that too. Ned is the closest thing Theon had to a father, and yet Ned was a very distant and cold figure to him, hardly fatherly. His feelings were most definitely not returned, but even so Theon still wanted to be a Stark more than anything else.
1964	Toxspecific	2013-04-22	Yeah, that's what hit me about that too. Ned is the closest thing Theon had to a father, and yet Ned was a very distant and cold figure to him, hardly fatherly. His feelings were most definitely not returned, but even so Theon still wanted to be a Stark more than anything else.This episode was amazing. Just simply outstanding. Theon is pure gold for readers.
1965	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	Man, that Theon can get a pass on anything.
He's a complete piece of crap imo, the number pf people he got killed or being an insecure boob is astounding.  But one day he thinks he had good intentions and everything's fine.
1966	Toxspecific	2013-04-22	Man, that Theon can get a pass on anything.He's a complete piece of crap imo, the number pf people he got killed or being an insecure boob is astounding.  But one day he thinks he had good intentions and everything's fine.Its about how much you can expect from a guy who's never received moral guidance or parenting of any sort, thrown into a pressure cooker situation of life and death.
1967	Minsc	2013-04-22	He's a complete piece of crap imo, the number pf people he got killed or being an insecure boob is astounding.  But one day he thinks he had good intentions and everything's fine.How many people got killed because Ned decided to warn Cersei thus setting in motion the killing of Robert and thus the Wot5K?  Or how about all the people that died because Robb was outraged that his father was arrested for treason?  Or how about because Jaime couldn't stop having sex with his sister thus meaning that Robert's "heirs" were all bastards and he later had to push Bran out a window to keep this secret?
1968	Dove	2013-04-22	There's a pretty big difference between saying "poor, poor Theon is totally justified in everything he did because HE MADE ME SAD /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />" and "I can see where he's coming from and what led up to his decisions, also whoa literally nobody deserves the horrific fate he went through", duder.
It's hard to not have sympathy for a character who goes through two(?) years of constant physical and mental torture, gets his teeth broken, his fingers flayed and mutilated, etc. That's not justice by any definition of the word, especially not when it's being done by someone like Ramsay Snow.
1969	BananaSpice	2013-04-22	Yeah, Theon wasn't justified in many things he did. It COULD be argued that he was justified in "betraying" the Starks, b/c it WAS for his own blood/family/house ... but he obviously realizes that was a stupid decision (or at least he went about it the wrong way by trying to take Winterfell and be a Stark AND a Greyjoy).
It's different to say that we understand why he did what he did due to his unfortunate background / situation. He's simply a ridiculously sympathetic character, even before ADWD. Yes, he has a bit of an attitude, but I feel like it comes across as a defense mechanism (he's terrified of looking bad / always trying to save face).
If you can't sympathize with him after ADWD, then ... I just don't know. I have no words. lol
EDIT: I feel like the Theon haters just want Mary Sue characters, tbh /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />

1970	King of the Road	2013-04-22	Is it possible that "Boy" is actually Reek? I know given his commanding presence it seems unlikely, but it's always possible that D+D are bluffing and "Boy" is actually just the servant. It'd be a nice twist for book readers by finishing Theon's arc with him meeting Ramsay. We wouldn't even have to see the face, maybe even just a figure.
But in all likelihood Iwan Rheon is Ramsay which is just fine. He looks and acts the part so he gets my vote.
1971	Caryn Stark	2013-04-22	Theon's life may be pathetic, but as far as I'm concerned he earned it. Love Alfie Allen in this - can't wait to watch him turn into a.... rhymes with meek.

He looks and acts the part so he gets my vote.That would be a pretty big twist, but you know that between the lost opportunity of having Iwan Rheon in a throwaway role and it being impossible to keep a secret that big it just won't happen.Incidentally, I'm curious if they'll work in the "Reek" name angle at all. Theon's "Reek, reek, it rhymes with..." mantra was pretty powerful in the books but that's one of those things that could come across as really silly spoken out loud unless they really sell it.
1973	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	How many people got killed because Ned decided to warn Cersei thus setting in motion the killing of Robert and thus the Wot5K?

He's a doofus.  Ned is pretty much universally considered a fool,Rob did what he had to do.Jamie was a psychopath, but he has a ton of apologists too and was never as insecure and indecisive as theon.Not sure of your point.....
1974	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	EDIT: I feel like the Theon haters just want Mary Sue characters, tbh /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />Riiight.  Getting a bit defensive perhaps?  Who are the Mary Sue's in ASoIaF,
1975	BorhPT	2013-04-22	I loved their scene in this episode! we have a lovely moment and then (for the non-readers) *SLAP IN THE FACE*
Ramsay's mind games are so good, he got Theon thinking his own family doesn't care for him... now he feels truly abandoned... and it has just begun /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
he was so satisfied after Theon got arrested again
1976	King of Winters	2013-04-22	When Theon said his real father died in KL my eyes literally swelled up with tears. Makes me like Theon even more and shows again how much he'd regrets not choosing the Starks over his father.
1977	AliKat	2013-04-22	I'm sorry but I think Alfie is doing a brilliant job but at the same time, I feel like so much critical time is being spent on his storyline considering he's not even in the next two books and the time is being taken away from storylines that belong in ASOS. Jon and the Wildling storyline is practically non-existant. Bran/Jojen/Meera's storyline is barely there either. They haven't shown any of their traveling to the Wall - just a little bit of Bran's dreams. Not much of Jojen explaining them plus I'd like Meera to start telling stories like the Knight of the Laughing Tree. 
	Spoiler We know Robb/Cat's storyline's are ending soon
 so why spend sooooo much time on Theon/boy when they could push most of that to Season 4.I'd much rather they focused on storylines from the first half of ASOS than just giving Alfie a chance to act. Plus I'm not all that thrilled watching him be tortured for the next 2-3 seasons.
1978	BananaSpice	2013-04-22	Riiight.  Getting a bit defensive perhaps?  Who are the Mary Sue's in ASoIaF,There really aren't any, which is why I'm always so confused about the Theon hate ... if you like ASOIAF, then what's the deal? I guess Dany might be the closest to a Mary Sue, but she's my other favorite character and has flaws, so idk.Theon's life may be pathetic, but as far as I'm concerned he earned it. Love Alfie Allen in this - can't wait to watch him turn into a.... rhymes with meek.It's not fair to say he earned it, tbh.Also, haters, please tell me more about how the Starks "saved" him from his awful family by taking him hostage as a child under threat of death. /rolleyes.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' />  He certainly didn't "earn" that, and it's that event that molded him into the pitiful and confused person he is.
1979	Tadco26	2013-04-22	I get the need to show what happened to Theon since the show doesn't do flashbacks and there is no internal monologue.  That being said, I'm not sure if I like WHAT they decided to show.  It's just not clear what the point of letting Theon go and then killing four Bolton men just to recapture him was.  Yes Ramsay ended up learning about Bran and Rickon, but that was completely voluntary confession which was more luck than planned, at the very door of the dungeon room.  As other's have commented we have no clue on where Theon started and where he ended up.  He headed east and that makes one presume the Dreadfort.  But leaves the question of where did he start?  And why wouldn't Theon know that Deepwood Motte is in the west on the coast, making it impossible for any castle to be west of it.  Did he really go in a big circle?  I would have preferred the escape scene Theon remembers from the book with Kyra letting him go and Ramsays dogs hunting them down.  Maybe we will still get it, but it seems a bit unlikely to have two escapes. 
The other thing I noticed is that Ramsay's explanation and personality when he said that he brought Theon back and that Theon had killed the other 4 came across as subordinate, like he was explaining himself to a higher authority figure.
1980	AliKat	2013-04-22	EDIT: I feel like the Theon haters just want Mary Sue characters, tbh /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />But Theon wasn't really a nice guy before he invaded Winterfell. It's not like that was his only misdeed. (just talking about show verse Theon) Think about how he treated people (especially women) like Old Nan (called her an the old bat to her face), roughing up Ros, and threatening Osha. He talked a lot of smack. He wasn't a good person. The only redeeming quality he had in my mind was rescuing Bran from the Wildlings.And think about it, Robb Stark was the one person that trusted Theon. None of the northererns or other starks did. HIs own father and sister didn't trust him. Robb trusted him and Theon stabbed him in the back.I do feel bad that he gets tortured but at the same time, he wasn't an innocent victim in all that.
1981	Mammothsbane	2013-04-22	That scene was the only time in my SoIaF life I've felt bad for Theon..
Alfie did a great job
1982	BananaSpice	2013-04-22	But Theon wasn't really a nice guy before he invaded Winterfell. It's not like that was his only misdeed.

Robb trusted him and Theon stabbed him in the back.I do feel bad that he gets tortured but at the same time, he wasn't an innocent victim in all that.Oh yeah, he comes across as a total prick, I agree. I feel that it's a defense mechanism that he developed over the years to deal with the threat of death looming over his head / being a hostage. I mean, not everyone would respond in that way, but it makes sense based on being raised as a Greyjoy to age 8 (in the show, 10 in the book). Trying to be strong and confident and coming off as an ass. It makes sense to me. *shrug*He's definitely not perfect, and has made bad decisions (he admits it), but he's not an evil or awful or horrible person. Deep down, I honestly think he's a good guy. In the show and the books, he is super remorseful and doubts himself all the time, and that's just not something you see from an evil character.
1983	AliKat	2013-04-22	Also, haters, please tell me more about how the Starks "saved" him from his awful family by taking him hostage as a child under threat of death. /rolleyes.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' />  He certainly didn't "earn" that, and it's that event that molded him into the pitiful and confused person he is.But let's be honest - he only complained about being a hostage after his father didn't welcome him with open arms. He was bragging about how Robb Stark trusted him and he was going to be able to make his father a king again. The Starks had no choice, Theon had no choice, but Theon was treated better than Jon in the book as far as status went. Theon was still son of a lord. Jon was the bastard son of a lord who sat in the back of the great hall rather than with the other high born kids.
1984	AliKat	2013-04-22	In the show and the books, he is super remorseful and doubts himself all the time, and that's just not something you see from an evil character.But was he remorseful because he lost and got tortured. If he was still in power at Winterfell and running the show, not being tortured and what not - he wouldn't be remorseful. Its easy to regret your actions when you end up getting punished for them. Its a different story to regret them and feel remorse while you're still benefitting from it.
1985	BananaSpice	2013-04-22	Ok, I just keep repeating myself over and over b/c ppl obviously aren't reading the entire thread. Theon regrets his actions during ACOK, NOT just b/c he was tortured / lost.
No one can convince me that he was treated better than Jon Snow. Jon Snow would never have been killed in Winterfell for any reason and only Catelyn was resentful towards him. EVERYONE resented or was distant from Theon except for Robb and on occasion Ned (who tried to "play the father" but also kept his distance bc he may have had to kill him).
In a lot of Theon's POV's (ACOK and ADWD) he REMEMBERS being afraid as a hostage (especially at first). He has an epiphany near the end of ACOK in which he realizes that he's always felt the noose around his neck. How could a child not be afraid in his situation? I refuse to believe that he was just "Oh yeah, whatever" about being a hostage. It's absurd.
1986	Minsc	2013-04-22	but Theon was treated better than Jon in the book as far as status went. Theon was still son of a lord. Jon was the bastard son of a lord who sat in the back of the great hall rather than with the other high born kids.Actually, besides the rare occurrence of him being able to sit at the High Table with the King it is remembered that Jon received better treatment.  Which is not surprising seeing how he was raised as almost an equal son of Lord Ned Stark whom the entire North loved.  While, Theon was the son of the traitor and despised Balon Greyjoy, whose people are a constant threat to the homelands of the North and Riverlands.  Moreover, Jon at least has the ability to bond with Ned and the Stark kids by his being related to them by blood.  In contrast, Ned kept his distance from Theon because someday he might have to execute Theon for his father's crimes.  Furthermore, there is the wide age gap between Theon and the various Stark kids with Robb and Jon being the only ones not almost a decade younger then Theon which hampers one's ability to really connect with someone when you are that young.
1987	Versiroth	2013-04-22	But was he remorseful because he lost and got tortured. If he was still in power at Winterfell and running the show, not being tortured and what not - he wouldn't be remorseful. Its easy to regret your actions when you end up getting punished for them. Its a different story to regret them and feel remorse while you're still benefitting from it.In the books, he showed remorse during some of his inter monologues at Winterfell for the deaths he caused there.   He also didn't harm Bran or Rickon.   Theon is a character that never truly belongs any where and always tries to over compensate.   He also is always making the wrong decisions, normally based on how he wants others to approve of him.   Theon makes horrible choices through out the series, but he was never a truly evil character deserving of the torture he received.   Heck, people love Jaime and all he ever truly was was a douche.   Heck, so far, he was captured and imprisoned.   Which he deserved.   He was crippled.  Which he also deserved (Bran).  And he was also cut off by Cersi.... which is his sister.   Other than saving Brienne, what has he done that makes him so endearing to everyone?
1988	purplehazee	2013-04-22	Poor theon man, in the show he is my favorite character and alfie allen portrays him amazingly. In the book jon snow is my favorite, kit harington does an alright job he's just not how I imagine jon snow in my head. He's too short and stocky. Oh well but ya poor theon I felt so bad for him.

Why would people who only like Mary Sue characters love ASoIaF?The majority of us just dont give Theon an auto-pass because simply because he's confused.  Personally, I think he's one of the best characters in the book as far a tragedies go, but I think he's a scumbag and not at all smart.   Nobody deserves a flaying, and I would loooove if he were somehow able to repay Ramsey personally, but I would like to see him dead as well.

It just seems like a lot of hate arguments against Theon are "he was mean to the Starks" or "he killed 2 boys" ... ok, well, it would be boring if he were just a super hero character who "became good" b/c he was "raised by the starks" and he "loved them" and was perfectly perfect in every way. Also, all the characters make mistakes and/or do some awful things, for the most part, and it seems like ppl are extra hard on Theon (compared to Jaime, The Hound, etc.)I can't imagine being fascinated with his character without my heart bleeding for him, but maybe that's just me.My biggest ASOIAF wish is for Theon and Dany to survive to the end. I will be furious if Theon dies in an anticlimatic way, though. If he's going to die, I want it to be amazing and tragic and sad and I will cry forever. I don't think his redemption arc is over yet.I also don't think
1991	Ramsay Gimp	2013-04-22	Remember, it's not going to be multiple seasons of just torture in a dungeon. Eventually, Theon is let out to become Ramsay's pet /devil.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':devil:' />  I'm guessing that will happen in the early or middle section of season 4

1994	Sidonie	2013-04-22	Also, all the characters make mistakes and/or do some awful things, for the most part, and it seems like ppl are extra hard on Theon (compared to Jaime, The Hound, etc.)Yeah, a lot of people hate Theon...but not because he did things that were so much more terrible than say, the Hound. People hate Theon because he was so arrogant initially. People, in general, enjoy seeing arrogance (especially if undeserved) punished.Anyhoo, I am really enjoying the Ramsay scenes so far.In the books there was a sexual element to the way Ramsay tortured Reek. I wonder if we're going to see any of that in the hbo show.

Personally, I think he's one of the best characters in the book as far a tragedies go, but I think he's a scumbag and not at all smart. I disagree with this repeated idea that Theon is some type of idiot, in how both his original plan with Robb was sound and smart strategic move so too was his idea regarding how to capture Winterfell with a handful of men. (Quite frankly, he performs no worse then Asha in this regard)The problem that he faces is a personality flaw of him equally wishing to be a "Stark" thus instead of just burning and pillaging Winterfell like an Ironborn he allows this desire to dictate the decision that he stay and try to rule Winterfell like Ned Stark.Is this foolish?  Yes, but I would say it is no more idiotic then either Ned's or Robb's fatal decisions when they allowed their actions be dictated their wishes to act in a honorable manner.

I wonder if we're going to see any of that in the hbo show.That really makes a lot of sense ... I just don't see arrogance as THAT bad of a personality flaw, especially considering the situation. I think he tried to build himself up / clung to his name/family/honor in an attempt to counter all the distrust and hatred he faced in Winterfell. I understand why ppl don't like an arrogant prick in general, though. His arrogance also decreased over the entire second season / ACOK, though. And is obviously gone at this point in the story (after ADWD).Davos didn't kill any kids and I love him, lolso after this week's episode I changed my opinion about Theon a bit. Book Theon is still a bag of dicks to me, while tv Theon is another story all together.

Book Theon is still a bag of dicks to me, while tv Theon is another story all together. I honestly like him and feel bad for the guywh- this is sillythey're literally the exact same character, show Theon is just laying out his motives sooner and not in an inner monologue. it just took him longer to get to this revelation in the bookIn the books there was a sexual element to the way Ramsay tortured Reek. I wonder if we're going to see any of that in the hbo show.Not really, imo. I mean, him forcing Theon to get Jeyne "ready" on their wedding night was rape but aside from that & Theon's possible-castration there wasn't a directly sexual element between them. What there was was just another way of breaking Theon down, since he was so proud of his prowess with the ladies and all. Everything done was 100% about fracturing Theon's identity and humbling him pretty much because Ramsay resented his confidence and his birth. (And also the perk of getting a new "Reek" because Ramsay has a pretty standard, compulsive serial killer M.O. going on, with his women hunts always following the same pattern and his need to have a Reek.)That makes Theon's comment about Robb even more meaningful, "He didn't have to lord it over me - he just had to be" or w/e he said. Ramsay's pretty much a twisted carnival funhouse mirror of Theon in his desire for acceptance and to be something he wasn't born to be.

1998	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	LOVED IT. "The only father I knew was beheaded in King's Landing'' broke my heart. Alfie is fantastic AND GOD DAMN YES, I SPY A RAMSAY.
1999	Sidonie	2013-04-22	I think the show shows more of Theon's inner conflict, compared to the books.
For instance, you see him at Winterfell being reminded it's "Not your house" (Robb said this to Theon).
Even Tyrion mocks Theon for his "loyalty to [his] captors." I think even ROS made some kind of snarky comment to Theon, as well.
Then, in the show you see that Theon is really being egged on by Dagmar, to "prove" himself.
In the book, it seems like Theon just betrayed Robb out of his own desire for power.
Comparing the two, I'd definitely say TV Theon is more likeable than Book Theon.

What there was was just another way of breakingI don't know. The relationship seemed very sexual in a sick, twisted way. What was the "Reek belongs to Ramsay, and Ramsay belongs to Reek" thing about? Also, in one of the book Reek chapters, he describes Ramsay speaking to him "like a lover" or something like that.
2001	Dove	2013-04-22	Yeah, the language exists to make you uncomfortable & reinforces a dark undercurrent, but it's just to emphasize the twisted co-dependence going on.edit: we all know that GRRM doesn't shy away from that kind of thing. It's in Ramsay's M.O. to see torture as sexual and take a sadistic thrill in inflicting pain, but that's as far as that sort of thing goes. All of Theon's strongest memories of his torture involve Ramsay's mindgames - as proud as Theon was, he would most definitely be far more pained by rape. Ramsay is just very, very co-dependent and has "taught" Theon to be the same, and the descriptions/text is meant to be evocative of an abusive relationshipWhat really intrigues me is what the hell was going on with the original Reek. He obviously had a lot to do with how Ramsay got to be the way he is, like Roose said: who corrupted who? Or did they just feed into each others' psychosis? I kind of assume that maybe Reek abused Ramsay in some way but I'm starting to think it probably wasn't that simple, and I doubt we'll ever get a definite example now.

Also, in one of the book Reek chapters, he describes Ramsay speaking to him "like a lover" or something like that.Theon will also only take his clothes off for Ramsay. Ramsay's sadistic games also often seem to have a sexual aspect (raping) ... I feel like it would make sense for there to be a weird, twisted sexual aspect ... but I could just as easily see it not being there. I dunno.

On a re-read, though, he does seem super loyal and close to Robb ... but then there's that line where Ned wants Theon extra guarded b/c shit is going down, and he's worried about Balon making a move - what does he want him guarded for? Hmm?Theon is egged on by Reek/Ramsay in the book in the same way as Dagmer.Also, the chapter in the book between Balon and Theon is pretty darn close to the show ... and Asha is even worse to him, it seems. And there are all these little details, like everyone is a stranger to him, and he feels ill eating the fish ... so many little things that make him feel depressed about how it isn't his home anymore, and Balon makes him feel like a fool and I believe he feels guilty about being loyal to the Starks, so it's no surprise he changes sides.

You contradicted yourself...  If Ramsay takes sexual pleasure in inflicting pain (which he does, I'm sure) then there is a directly sexual element between them.  Ramsay is a sexual sadist.  The two go hand-in-hand for him.
2005	Maester Ruin	2013-04-22	i always thought Ramsay was inspired by The Joker from the batman comics, and his warped sense of humor and his mindgames where he is always five steps ahead of his victims reminds me of Heath Ledgers version in the dark knight movie. the TDK quote "i just did what i do best, i took your little plan and i turned it on itself" very much applies to how Reek manipulated Theon in winterfell. i know the book came out before the movie but still...

2006	Dove	2013-04-22	You've got a point, I explained myself poorly. I mean a sexual interest in Theon himself specifically - I don't think anyone could argue that Ramsay doesn't take a perverse satisfaction in his "work". That's the only way he can get satisfaction, is through inflicting pain.
For him and women specifically it's all about the hunt and the fight (and he's used to the old Reek being there to take his turn), and that's probably why he needed "help" with Jeyne.

2010	Spring Snow	2013-04-22	He does... or Roose does, anyway. I'm not sure if Ramsay mentioned it, actually. I can't see it being anything but Ramsay doing it, though.
Apparently people suspect Roose becuase of the type of poison used being too expensive for a peasant like Ramsay to get a hold of, or something like that? I don't remember, but it seems unnecessarily complicated.

If book Theon ever says anything remotely like this please let me know, I'll reread ADwD right now, ha ha habest I can remember is him calling Robb his real brother

Either way, I agree. With Ramsay's traits so well established it would be rather silly to have the answer be anyone but him, and narratively speaking I don't think there would be anything to gain.
2014	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-22	In ADWD I thought Ramsay had raped Theon at some point. I can't recall a specific passage, but it was an impression. Ramsay rapes plenty of women, and there are only so many ways you can break someone. Also, within the events of ADWD, Theon makes a comment about "shameful things" he and Jeyne have had to do in Ramsay's bedroom. (coupled with Jeyne's later dog comment /stillsick.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':stillsick:' /> )
I like show!Theon a bit more than his book counterpart, even though they are very similar. Book Theon just seemed like more of a douche until ADWD. The visual element helps--even if Theon is saying/doing something terrible, you can see his face/hear his voice and see the cracks forming. Also, I was a lot older when I saw the show than when I read the book.
Heh, my favorite GoT podcast, Cast of Kings, has a book reader and non-book reader. The non-reader went "I think Theon's plot has jumped the shark because it seems like a pointless circle" and talked more. Then, he said "If this psycho turns out to be a major character, ok then, that was good set up" and something to the effect of how impressive a level of villainy it was. He then went back to the circles thing bugging him. His reader co-host was dead silent, then the non-reader goes "Did the Boy's story reek to you?" and I nearly lost it.

2015	lostinwesteros	2013-04-22	I couldn't really hear the dialogue clearly, but did Theon say something to the effect of, "The only father I knew was beheaded in King's Landing?"Yep, and that was one of the saddest parts.  Poor Theon, sitting there in remorse, owning all of his 'sins' and poor choices, and Ramsay being SO sympathetic.....right before the horrible turning around of it all.  And the look on Ramsay's face at the end....shudder.There was one thing that didn't fit for me, though, and that's how in the world was Theon supposed to have killed all those men, as Ramsay said he did?
2016	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	Alfie Allen is fantastic.
2017	Randyll Tarly	2013-04-22	What I don't understand is why the writers would want the Boltons to know that Bran and Rickon aren't dead.Unless you have read the books.... you don't want to know the answer to that question yet.
2018	Maester Ruin	2013-04-22	My non-book reader friends have pretty much figured out that "boy" is a major character by now, his amount of screentime and the commanding voice when he told the men to tie theon up gave it away. Their theories regarding who he is is very entertaining to listen to, one of my friends is dead sure that he is a Greyjoy, a younger brother that theon never knew about /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

The only person I can think off doing such a thing would be Euron Greyjoy sending someone to keep Theon tormented as he visits his dear brothers on the Iron Islands.
2020	Randyll Tarly	2013-04-22	There was one thing that didn't fit for me, though, and that's how in the world was Theon supposed to have killed all those men, as Ramsay said he did?Who do you think told Skinner and everybody else about Theon leaving his bed? It wouldn't be surprising he set everything up due to being underminded by his own men and decided to play a little game with them.
2021	Maester Ruin	2013-04-22	If that were the case... The only person I can think off doing such a thing would be Euron Greyjoy sending someone to keep Theon tormented as he visits his dear brothers on the Iron Islands.yeah, his comments almost made me giggle precisly because Euron is probably the character who has most in common with Ramsay in the saga.

2023	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	It just seems like a lot of hate arguments against Theon are "he was mean to the Starks" or "he killed 2 boys" ... ok, well, it would be boring if he were just a super hero character who "became good" b/c he was "raised by the starks" and he "loved them" and was perfectly perfect in every way. Also, all the characters make mistakes and/or do some awful things, for the most part, and it seems like ppl are extra hard on Theon (compared to Jaime, The Hound, etc.)I can't imagine being fascinated with his character without my heart bleeding for him, but maybe that's just me.My biggest ASOIAF wish is for Theon and Dany to survive to the end. I will be furious if Theon dies in an anticlimatic way, though. If he's going to die, I want it to be amazing and tragic and sad and I will cry forever. I don't think his redemption arc is over yet.He swore his sword to Robb and stabbed him in the back, took Winterfell and unleashed Ramsey on Winterfell.  Those are what he did wrong to the Starks.  It wasn't endearing that he killed the Miller's sons (one other way Theon can be more tragic is if one of them or both were his kids).  I dont think there's much to like personally, but its cool to see how many different ways these characters inspire and/or hook readers.  I hate him and love his chapters.
2024	redriver	2013-04-22	Alfie Allen is fantastic.He is.Which to my mind is quite satisfying,considering his sister wrote a bitch slap song about him,and his real father,Keith is often a complete arsehole in public, though a decent actor.I think D&D are playing the Bolton angle wonderfully,both Roose and Ramsay.The payoff comes in the RW episode,I think.
2025	shiola	2013-04-22	He swore his sword to Robb and stabbed him in the back, took Winterfell and unleashed Ramsey on Winterfell.  Those are what he did wrong to the Starks.  ...He unleashed Ramsay?  As I recall, Robb allowed Bolton to send his bastard to re-capture the castle.  And Theon was unconscious when Ramsay came in and killed everyone/burned everything down.
2026	Randyll Tarly	2013-04-22	...He unleashed Ramsay?  As I recall, Robb allowed Bolton to send his bastard to re-capture the castle.  And Theon was unconscious when Ramsay came in and killed everyone/burned everything down.If Theon had just stayed with raiding fishermen along the coast as he was ordered, I don't think Roose would have suggested sending Ramsay after him. So in a tactical way he did allowed Roose to unleash his bastard with the consent of his King.
2027	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	I disagree with this repeated idea that Theon is some type of idiot, in how both his original plan with Robb was sound and smart strategic move so too was his idea regarding how to capture Winterfell with a handful of men. (Quite frankly, he performs no worse then Asha in this regard)The problem that he faces is a personality flaw of him equally wishing to be a "Stark" thus instead of just burning and pillaging Winterfell like an Ironborn he allows this desire to dictate the decision that he stay and try to rule Winterfell like Ned Stark.Is this foolish?  Yes, but I would say it is no more idiotic then either Ned's or Robb's fatal decisions when they allowed their actions be dictated their wishes to act in a honorable manner.Trying to hold winterfell with 30 men was idiotic.   Asha could hold a castle close to the sea so you aren't entirely correct.   The noose around Beth's neck wasn't a great idea either.  Pretty scummy, and it couldn't ever work.  Rodrik HAD to try to take Winterfell back regardless of what Theon threatened.Him letting Reek do anything and everything he wanted wasnt all that smart either, nor was trying to boss Reek around when he entered (with theon's permission) winterfell with over 10x the men that theon had.  Robb and Ned made plenty of mistakes, I'm pretty sure no one's saying they didnt.Theon's ridiculous attitude when he returns to Pyke is pretty annoying.  Asha punks him over and over and he never humbles himself to give her any credit.  He's told that he is not his father's only heir by Ironborn custom, and he refuses to acknowledge that either.
2028	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	...He unleashed Ramsay?  As I recall, Robb allowed Bolton to send his bastard to re-capture the castle.  And Theon was unconscious when Ramsay came in and killed everyone/burned everything down.I was speaking about book theon.

I think they have had a bit of a discussion beforehand that lead to that exchange. The whole"Did the Boy's story reek to you?""Yeah it kind of reeked"- was some of the funniest stuff I have heard all week,
2030	Ordos	2013-04-22	I think one plot line they could put in to make Boys story more interesting is not only torturing Theon but also hunting Bran, Rickon, the Reeds and Hodor while they try to evade capture as they make their way to the wall. But this would mean revealing Boys identity a little sooner.
Picture it: Boy goes on a hunt, finds nothing, maybe even have a few of his guys injured or killed trying to capture Bran and Rickon and comes back to the Dreadfort to vent by torturing Theon.

2031	PetyrPunkinhead	2013-04-22	Does anyone know if Theon ever spoke that line about his real father being Ned in any of the books? I remember thinking that to myself, but I can't recall Theon ever saying/thinking those words exactly.this scene was one of the ones i liked the best of in the episode. The look in "boys" eyes when they were putting Theon back on the post was classic.Yeah, Ramsay/Perv Boy had this look on his face.
2032	Dove	2013-04-22	He doesn't that I know of, the closest he comes to that is realizing that Robb was pretty much his brother.
You could say it's out of character for him (or book Theon or w/e) to say something like that about cold, distant Ned but IDK, I thought it was sadly fitting. Just another person that Theon's latched on to that doesn't regard him in nearly the same way.
2033	Ramsay Gimp	2013-04-22	The show writers made the decision to make Theon closer to the Starks and therefore more sympathetic, and I think it was a good one. To be fair, I think Theon has the same feelings in the novels (toward Robb) but refuses to acknowledge them until ADWD. In the show, however, he named Robb "brother" and nearly warned him of Balon's plans. This gave his arc a lot more emotional impact and I think was a rare improvement over the source material. 
Naming Eddard his "true father" isn't that much of a stretch at this point, either. It's actually the logical result of Robb being his "brother." But it is more of a change from the book than his feelings toward Robb
2034	MannyAntony	2013-04-22	I have to agree about feeling bad for theon now rather than later, my throat kinda hurt when he said " my real father got beheaded in kings landing".... Alfie is a great Actor.! man great scenes.
2035	Randyll Tarly	2013-04-22	I think one plot line they could put in to make Boys story more interesting is not only torturing Theon but also hunting Bran, Rickon, the Reeds and Hodor while they try to evade capture as they make their way to the wall.

And just when he just finished flaying Theon he receives a notice of his father asking him to send proof that he holds the Greyjoy kid to Robb Stark before the RW takes place in this season. Although I would also like a second escape happening but with somebody else and he simply following on the tracks and slowly getting Theon paranoid enough to become the meek.
2036	MannyAntony	2013-04-22	quick question... so now does ramsay know that bran and rickon are alive? he seemed kinda shocked when he heard theon say so
2037	Ramsay Gimp	2013-04-22	I think one plot line they could put in to make Boys story more interesting is not only torturing Theon but also hunting Bran, Rickon, the Reeds and Hodor while they try to evade capture as they make their way to the wall.

It can be part of his "Reek" training, and Theon is the only one at the Dreadfort who could identify Bran and Rickon anyway
2038	Ramsay Gimp	2013-04-22	quick question... so now does ramsay know that bran and rickon are alive? he seemed kinda shocked when he heard theon say soYes. Unlike in the novels, where it is actually Ramsay's idea to "kill" the boys, Ramsay in the show really thought Theon had killed the two Princes when he captured him

2039	The Night's Prince	2013-04-22	Ramsay makes the Scarecrow look like a 2nd rate birthday party clown.
2040	MarieAntoinette	2013-04-22	Anyhoo, I am really enjoying the Ramsay scenes so far.In the books there was a sexual element to the way Ramsay tortured Reek. I wonder if we're going to see any of that in the hbo show.Personally I hope they don't go too much in this direction. There is already some fanart shipping Ramsay / Reek out there, and I dislike this approach because I think the story of Theon breaking down physically and mentally and becoming Reek is so horrible. I feel that if there are too many hints that point to a twisted sexual relationship the tragic story of Theon's transformation might not come across as it should. I really don't want this to turn into a "Let's watch how sexy half-naked Theon gets tortured on the cross" kind of thing.Anyhow, I think that the actor playing Ramsay was really creepy in some of his scenes in episode 4. He probably is a good choice to play Ramsay after all despite not looking like I imagined Ramsey from reading the books. TV Theon is more likeable than book Theon so far, in the book he seemed to be such an arrogant jerk. His comment on Eddard being his real father made him much more sympathetic to me.
2041	Bolton's Bastard	2013-04-23	Does anyone know if Theon ever spoke that line about his real father being Ned in any of the books? I remember thinking that to myself, but I can't recall Theon ever saying/thinking those words exactly.I don't think that he does, but he does have a moment with ultimately the same effect in ADwD, when he's climbing the steps to Winterfell's great hall (I think) and he thinks about how he should have died with Robb.
2042	Is He Dead Yet?	2013-04-23	Jon and the Wildling storyline is practically non-existant. Bran/Jojen/Meera's storyline is barely there either. I wouldn't be too surprised if they were the focus of season four. Just saying.
2043	Southron_Ambitions	2013-04-23	If I remember correctly, in the books Theon recalls how cold and distant Eddard was toward him. Theon did love Robb but I don't think he had any love for Eddard and he certainly didn't think of him as his father. Maybe he secretly wished. Eddard had treated him as a son.I actually think Theon's feeling that Eddard is his real father is an improvement over the source as well. Much more emotionally impactful knowing what Theon has coming.
2044	Toxspecific	2013-04-23	Eddard knew Theon was a hostage and that if his father did anything stupid again he might have to behead Theon with Ice. So that's why he never tried to grow too close to Theon.
2045	Jazzman	2013-04-23	I got really got goosebumps the moment when "Boy" did that satisfied face and said "Put him back where he belongs".I Really like where the Theon story is going even if it's quite changed!
2046	Caryn Stark	2013-04-23	I have had a few text and messages in my inbox from 'unsullied' types who want to know what is going on with Theon. They aren't sure if they missed something. I just told them to keep watching because I'm afraid I'll spoil it. It is interesting to see the take on things from those who haven't read the books. I do wonder when they are going to reveal Ramsay, and how far they will go with Theon's torture.
2047	Stargareyen	2013-04-23	The way the show is shaping up the characters, Ramsay and Joffrey would almost look like partners-in-crime ... Ramsay takes care of the torture in the North, Joffrey in the South /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
Alfie is doing way more justice to Theon's character than I could have imagined... respect!
2048	Cas Stark	2013-04-23	hey all, I'm new to these forums but love the discussion here. I have a question about the Theon/Ramsay scenes from Episode 2/3. Just a heads up don't worry if you spoil anything for me as I've already read through the entire GoT wiki pages.I understand from Season 2 Roose Bolton sent Ramsay to Winterfell to re-take the ciry from Theon. Roose mentioned to Robb that his "bastard" son was almost at Winterfell in Season 2. Now I'm assuming the army of North-men who surrounded Theon and eventually burned down Winterfel was lead by Ramsay under Roose's instructions.Here is where I get confused. Why did Ramsay free Theon from being tortured, save him from being captured again only to lead him to another location to be tortured? He was already being tortured by Ramsay's men wasn't he to begin with? Wasn't he in Winterfell when he was being tortured the first time? I'm really confused about all of this.Thanks in advanceNo, he was being tortured at the Dreadfort, he is back in exactly the same place he was taken from...X marks the spot.  Ramsey does it because he likes to play mind games and he wants to break Theon mentally so in future Theon will expect any escape plans are something that Ramsey is behind and will have no hope of success.
2049	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-23	The fact that Ramsey knows about Bran/Rickon and yet does nothing to try to find them and make sure they do not return to claim their birthright baffles me. Granted they're kids and therefore he probably doesn't consider them a threat. But they won't stay kids forever and everyone in the North knows - the North rallies to the Starks, whether its Eddard, Robb, Bran, Rickon, Sansa, etc. The Northmen marched in the snow for weeks to save 'Arya'. I don't remember in the books if Roose knows Bran/Rickon are alive but I feel like if he did, he'd have them hunted down. Well, it's kind of a dual edged sword because everyone in the North believes them to be dead.  As long as that is the case, then Robb's defeat leaves the North without a ruler, and it is easier for Roose to consolidate his power and position as Warden.    But if they start sending out search parties for Bran and Rickon, then word will leak out that they aren't dead, and that's going to make it harder for Roose.Plus, word of them hasn't popped up anywhere, so there's always the possibility that even though they escaped Winterfell, they really are dead.
2050	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-23	I totally spied a Ramsay.
2051	King of Hats	2013-04-23	I didn'y understand 'Ramsay's' line after returning with Theon. Something like 'look I found him and bought him back'. Didn;t sound like someone in charge
2052	Nezzer	2013-04-23	I didn'y understand 'Ramsay's' line after returning with Theon. Something like 'look I found him and bought him back'. Didn;t sound like someone in chargeHe says "I brought him back, he killed the others". Like I said in another thread, I think this was to hide from his men that they are completely expendable to him. I doubt they would be so loyal to Ramsay if they learned that he would kill his own men for his mind games.

2054	Toxspecific	2013-04-24	Well as it often happens my post was ignored so...Theon Greyjoy is who? A hostage treated well by his captors who was taken from his family (if you can call those nuts a family) at a young age and taken to Winterfell. He never grew close to any Stark but Robb and he had no parent figures; Ned could not grow close to him because he might have to chop his head off one day. Robb was younger than Theon and often looked up to him; Theon himself had nobody to look up to.More importantly, he had no parent figure. In a world like Westeros, so full of crimes and killing and fighting, you damn well need a guardian or parent figure to teach you how to go about doing good. Theon had none of that.And suddenly, Theon Greyjoy, who has never been in an important decision making situation, finds himself siding with his real family over Robb to his later regret and taking over Winterfell. With no hope of holding it.Suddenly his only choices are the Night's Watch and death. How fucked is he? Very fucked. Now my question, how could people expect him not to take rash decisions in a situation he was essentially a major noob in?

2060	BananaSpice	2013-04-24	Of course Ned taught him morals.  The maester too.You can't just have morals talked at you without also having close mentors that you fully trust. There could never be 100% trust between Theon and Ned. It makes a lot of sense that Theon is constantly DESPERATELY striving for approval. In the show, that's why he follows Dagmer even though to most, it doesn't seem a good idea. It's the reason he switched back to his father's side (when he realized his father was actually on a different side). It's the reason he lets himself be manipulated by the wrong people and makes stupid, rash decision in order to avoid embarrassment and ridicule. He'll basically cling to anyone who makes him feel decent about himself.Seriously, his life from young child to adult must have been exhausting, trying to prove himself ALL THE TIME. Like he refers to in his monologue this past episode, he could never just "be" ... it's really sad.
2061	Toxspecific	2013-04-24	Of course Ned taught him morals.  The maester too.Theon cleary says he never had such a relationship with Ned. And you have absolutely nothing to go by when you say Ned taught him morals as he would have his own children; my view (that Ned did not give him such counselling), however, does have the fact that Ned was said to not try to grow close to Theon because of what happens to hostages if their fathers rebel.And we are not given any details of Maester Luwin's interaction with Theon before he takes Winterfell. Other than that one time he disses Theon while he's showing off (season 1, and if it is not in the books well we still have nothing). Then, when Theon technically becomes Lord of Winterfell, Maester Luwin then gives him advice because he is now Theon's castle's maester, bound by oaths.I don't think Theon would have felt such a lack of belonging if Ned and Luwin had been as close to him as you seem to think they were.

2063	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-24	I completely agree with those saying that if Theon had been cared for more then this wouldn't have happened, however, I can't blame Ned because to him, Theon IS just a hostage. They take care of him well enough, but he's required in no way to show Theon any sort of affection; and he doesn't.

Everybody probably just assumed that when Balon died, Theon would go back to be lord of the Iron Islands and marry somebody highborn. I think somebody says or thinks something about Ned trying to "soften" Theon (does anyone remember this?) but ... it's not like he tried THAT hard since he was keeping his distance for understandable reasons.
2065	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-24	Yeah, Ned's coldness is definitely understandable, I mean; this is a hostage who could end up needing to be killed one day. Theon could never have been a child of Ned's. Theon was never going to be a Stark, nor an Ironborn. It's sad really.
2066	Caryn Stark	2013-04-24	Is it just me or does Boy remind anyone of Smeagol...Hahaha. That's great... But 'Boy' is a lot smarter and sharper than smeagol. They both give me the willies.
2067	Rhaegarsjoy	2013-04-24	Well as it often happens my post was ignored so...Theon Greyjoy is who? A hostage treated well by his captors who was taken from his family (if you can call those nuts a family) at a young age and taken to Winterfell. He never grew close to any Stark but Robb and he had no parent figures; Ned could not grow close to him because he might have to chop his head off one day. Robb was younger than Theon and often looked up to him; Theon himself had nobody to look up to.More importantly, he had no parent figure. In a world like Westeros, so full of crimes and killing and fighting, you damn well need a guardian or parent figure to teach you how to go about doing good. Theon had none of that.And suddenly, Theon Greyjoy, who has never been in an important decision making situation, finds himself siding with his real family over Robb to his later regret and taking over Winterfell. With no hope of holding it.Suddenly his only choices are the Night's Watch and death. How fucked is he? Very fucked. Now my question, how could people expect him not to take rash decisions in a situation he was essentially a major noob in?My love of the Starks kinda gave me blind hatred for theon in the books, I have to say Alfie as theon is great and changed my opinion. when you think about it you understand his choices and why he made the decisions he did because I think a lot of ppl would do the same no one is gonna choose the ppl who kept you prisoner no matter how well treated you were over your own blood no matter that you were called a "guest", a guest can leave at the end of the day unless you're with the Freys. Anyways I think theon is really one of the more realistic characters, he fucked up I think even he realised he made the wrong choice, but once its made you can't unmake it and everything you do after is a follow through and you just digging yourself deeper. On a bit of a side note what would have happened to theon if the Starks weren't defeated,he was already in his twenties IIRC, I mean they wouldnt  return him to the iron islands n I don't see anyman marrying his daughter to the son of a traitor and  hostage living on charity.
2068	Toxspecific	2013-04-24	Are you talking show only here?Nope. Books as well.You say Ned and Luwin mentored him. I say they didn't. You don't have any detail, minute or not, to indicate that Ned and Luwin had a close bond with Theon. I, however, already gave one such small detail which very much indicated Ned did not get close to Theon. So there goes the mentoring, there goes the emphasis of morality in the brutal society he lives in.Toss a guy like that into a fray of bloodshed and war and it cannot end well.Disclaimer: None of this, pins any blame for anything on Ned; by all means he was exceedingly kind to Theon considering his position. Ned for the win.
2069	Jamie Lannister	2013-04-24	There's a post-episode four Alfie interview up here: http://www.rollingst...reyjoy-20130423Confirms and teases a few things to come with Theon/Ramsay (yeah, he straight out says that book readers have the right idea with this "Boy") this season.The last little bit is of note. I wonder what scene that is...
2070	Winterz	2013-04-24	I'm not sure I like this Gollum-Ramsay comparison.Gollum was corrupted by Evil. Ramsay wasn't, he... is the personification of Evil /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
2071	BananaSpice	2013-04-24	My love of the Starks kinda gave me blind hatred for theon in the books, I have to say Alfie as theon is great and changed my opinion. when you think about it you understand his choices and why he made the decisions he did because I think a lot of ppl would do the same no one is gonna choose the ppl who kept you prisoner no matter how well treated you were over your own blood no matter that you were called a "guest", a guest can leave at the end of the day unless you're with the Freys.

Assuming he would be a good match for a lot of high born young women. Ned may have even married Arya to him, who knows? Maybe that would have been seen as joining their houses to prevent more Greyjoy delusions of rebelling again. *shrug*
2072	Winterz	2013-04-24	Theon is the heir to the Iron Islands ... he was only a hostage to prevent Balon from rebelling, so presumably, once Balon died, Theon would be returned to take his place as lord.

Maybe that would have been seen as joining their houses to prevent more Greyjoy delusions of rebelling again. *shrug*Unlikely, the Ironborn wouldn't go from a capable leader (a dumbass in my terms but I guess they considered Balon capable enough to follow him in 2 ridiculous wars) to a young boy that hasn't even shown his strength yet. Besides, Theon has no knowledge nor experience at leading hence I think that what Balon assigned to him when he returned wasn't that bad to begin learning.
2073	Inquisitor Glokta	2013-04-24	I'm just curious about one thing, how long do you think they will stretch out the whole becoming reek part?
I mean, Theon disappears at the end of ACOK and reappears as Reek in ADWD where he still is sort of being tortured.
With ASOS being slit into 2 seasons and AFFC & ADWD probably being run chronologically this would leave season 3 and 4 for the torturing Oo seems a bit long to me...
2074	Caesar Augustus	2013-04-24	This guy KILLED CHILDREN.  Burned down his home, and needlessly killed people who he onced help serve.  Fantastic human being?  Sorry I don't find compasson for a guy, who be all defenition, is a monster.  He deserves to be tortured again... and again... and again.Awwww, but he is regreting all the bad stuff he did, because it didn't work out. Boo Hoo.In the books it was 'Reek'(Ramsay) who killed the two boys and flayed them.
2075	Rhaegarsjoy	2013-04-24	Was it ned who said he wished to make theon less like his father? that wouldnt have worked anyways if he return to the ironislands. The first thing his father says is he's not one of them, he buys things and not with the iron price if that's his own father I don't see how the ironborn would follow him, they'll just see ned with the balon name trying to change their ways.
2076	Winterz	2013-04-24	In the books it was 'Reek'(Ramsay) who killed the two boys and flayed them.Hey, welcome to the forums /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />Yeah, Reek in the books and Dagmer in the show, not really Theon.

2077	Prince of Dragonstone	2013-04-24	The part about Ned being like a real father was a bit of a shocker....but I just can't picture Ramsey being handsome....I picture him looking a bit more sinister.....but  the scenes were great Theon actually admitting that he got wayyy in over his head....The casting choice to make Ramsay handsome is actually a stroke of genius, IMO, because it will create conflict within the viewer about such a handsome guy being capable of such ugly inhumanity. Think Patrick Bateman from "American Psycho".
2078	dttljs123	2013-04-24	I love that they are making these scenes because GRRM just let theon be taken and made to disappear while Ramsey tortured him. D&D are letting us meet Ramsey before he becomes a Bolton.
2079	Toxspecific	2013-04-24	Theon took Winterfell and couldn't hold it.
Theon was not afraid of getting in a fight, even if it meant his own death for close to no gain for his side.
Theon had a sense of entitlement; that he deserved something.
Come to think of it, he was pretty Ironborn in some ways /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
2080	Prince of Dragonstone	2013-04-24	I hope the show addresses the backstory to Ramsay and about how Roose raped his mother and wanted to kill the baby but was spared when he discovered that the child had the same icy grey eyes. I hope the audience learns about Domeric Bolton and how Ramsay murdered him out of jealousy and ambition. I can't wait to see the interactions between Roose and Ramsay as they are great insights into just how twisted both of these characters are.
2081	Mark Antony	2013-04-24	Hey, welcome to the forums /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />Yeah, Reek in the books and Dagmer in the show, not really Theon.Theon gave the order,Even if he didn't come up with the idea, He is just as much at fault as Ramsay or Dagmer imo (no i don't think he deserves what he gets, I think he deserves a quick, clean death.)
2082	Winterz	2013-04-24	Theon gave the order,Even if he didn't come up with the idea, He is just as much at fault as Ramsay or Dagmer imo (no i don't think he deserves what he gets, I think he deserves a quick, clean death.)Well still, the show cleary makes Dagmer a large influence in Theon's actions, not that I'm excusing him but Dagmer is more to blame for those hideous acts.But anyway sir, you've just gained yourself a fan with that avatar/name. James Purefoy as Mark Antony in Rome was just....Godly.
2083	Sweet-N-SourRobin	2013-04-24	Yeah, it's definitely not Ned's fault ... no one could have predicted how things went down in the story. Everybody probably just assumed that when Balon died, Theon would go back to be lord of the Iron Islands and marry somebody highborn. I think somebody says or thinks something about Ned trying to "soften" Theon (does anyone remember this?) but ... it's not like he tried THAT hard since he was keeping his distance for understandable reasons.Ned makes the same mistake that every other greenlander makes with regard to the Iron Islands.  They assume that inheritance law works the same way out there as it does on mainland Westeros.  Theon even voices this assumption when he returns, telling Asha that he is dad's heir By Law.And Asha immediately corrects him:  "by greenlander law, maybe, but we have our own laws out here, little brother.  Or have you forgotten?"Balon also does two things that greenlander lords typical would not think to do and thus they could not anticipate Balon doing.  He emotionally lets go of Theon, which completely undermines the purpose of making Theon a hostage.  The goal is to keep Balon in line by threatening his son with death, but in taking Theon hostage and raising him in mainland culture Balon considers Theon in many ways to already be dead.  Or to have been made into something worse than dead;  No Longer Ironborn.  Because sons and heirs are so prized in mainland Westeros, it works among themselves, especially if you were to sieze the first son in line, as Theon would normally be.  Balon either does not want his son back or does not believe he can truly have his son back, after "fostering" changes him so.  So it becomes pointless.  Or even counter-productive.So Balon moves on to the next in line, because that is done more easily and with more precedent behind it in the Iron Islands (and Theon is dead to him anyway).  He also embraces/allows his daughter to become the heir, to the point where Balon starts calling Asha "son" and during the scene where he is dispensing battle plans to the Ironborn Captains, he refers to the task "his sons" will tend to.  Mainland Lords would not go to that length.Because of the difference in Ironborn culture, and the different mentality of Balon in particular, taking Theon hostage completely fails to accomplish anything that taking a child hostage is supposed to do.  Greenlanders like Ned just didn't know any better.  He did soften Theon, somewhat, and we can see it in how Robb and Theon became friends (as Ned, remembering his own fostering, no doubt hoped would happen).But they unwittingly disinherited Theon when they took him away and thus eliminated the political value in doing so.[edit:] Which underscores the tragedy of Theon's character/life.  He's got all this identity confusion and it ruins him and he goes on to do horrible horrible things that screw things up for so many because of it, and then to suffer even more horrible things himself, and it was all for nothing, from the start.

2084	Calidad	2013-04-24	So just to clarify...Theon is currenty in Deepwood Motte, or is it Moat Caitlin?
I wonder if we will see The Dreadfort this season
2085	Winterz	2013-04-24	So just to clarify...Theon is currenty in Deepwood Motte, or is it Moat Caitlin?I wonder if we will see The Dreadfort this seasonThat was the Dreadfort on both accounts, from two different angles.
2086	I'll pay the iron price	2013-04-24	I think Jaime summed it up best when speaking to Jory Cassel about the Greyjoys in Kings Landing (season 1).
Jaime said something like "I saw the youngest one Theon at Winterfell.............it was like seeing a Shark on a hilltop"
Theon wasnt a Stark and didnt belong there.
Trouble is, he had been away from Pyke so long, the other sharks wouldnt accept him anymore.
It was a powerful scene moments before Ramsay betrayed him when Theon said "My real father lost his head at Kings Landing"
It shows how messed up Theon is, he doesnt know where he belongs.
I like TV Theon MUCH better than book Theon
2087	aedalia	2013-04-24	Finally got to watch the episode last night and Theon broke my heart. He was trying to be all tough and stuff, but then, when it came right down to it, he realized he made a mistake and owned up to it, almost in an "If I get out of here, I'm going to make it right" kind of way, which makes what happened even more gut wrenching.
My father lost his head at King's Landing... oh... cries...
2088	Toxspecific	2013-04-24	Am I the only one who finds calling Northmen "green" rather stupid? /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

Ned for the win.Wrong.  I asked first if we're talking books or show.  Doesnt Luwin say that the starks cared for him and he taught theon himself.  Ill get my cok and got's for reference if I ever get some time today.Its also inferred that he was brought up along with Robb quite a few times.  So you are claiming that All if Ned's lessons to Rob and Jon excluded thein?  All of the lessons tey had with Luwin as well?You gave a show detail.  Totally different.
2091	Mulled Wino	2013-04-24	Ned makes the same mistake that every other greenlander makes with regard to the Iron Islands.

Taking wf and torching it was the thing to do.  Plunder, burn, leave.  How many times do Aeron, Balon, and Asha tell him whats up?  His arrogance and foolishness continually blind him.  He lets Ramsey in Wf with 500 men,  then proceeds to threaten him wen he has 20 men.
2092	crazibouncer	2013-04-24	What did the "boy" say when he brought Theon back? I missed it....He said something along the lines of, "I brought him back, he killed the others" referring to the men that 'Boy' killed.  I thought the scene was great and I felt so bad for Theon
2093	Randyll Tarly	2013-04-24	I'm not sure I like this Gollum-Ramsay comparison.Gollum was corrupted by Evil. Ramsay wasn't, he... is the personification of Evil /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />I must pledge my sword in agreement with your comment. Gollum was in deed corrupted, while my dear "Boy" is evil in flesh. It is true they are both kinslayers, but one of them did it for being tempted by the One Ring.... the other did it only because he wanted to. If you ask me, my dear boy Ramsay is more like the Joker in action.
2094	Toxspecific	2013-04-25	The what?Ironborn call everyone who isn't Ironborn 'green', which I find stupid seeing as Northmen, wildlings etc will never count as green. They're too tough for it.
2095	Randyll Tarly	2013-04-25	Ironborn call everyone who isn't Ironborn 'green', which I find stupid seeing as Northmen, wildlings etc will never count as green. They're too tough for it.Agreed, although the greenlander term refers more to the mainland. Unlike them who live in small islands. But that statement contradict itself since there are plenty of small islands or islands such as the shields and skaagos and they would be considered greenlanders. Secondly, I must agree with previous post about how Theon was dead for his family. He was morally dead and if I am not mistaken Balon himself said so in the TV Show and hoy Asha was a capable person and would be his top commander if he had went along the plan that Theon brought from Robb Stark.
2096	Randyll Tarly	2013-04-25	He said something along the lines of, "I brought him back, he killed the others" referring to the men that 'Boy' killed.  I thought the scene was great and I felt so bad for TheonTheon's face in that scene was epic! and boy saying that only called in more hatred from his men to grab and torture him more. It is obvious that Theon will be, if not already, psychologically broken. All that now comes is the pain he has to endure for his missteps and his stupidity in trusting the very first idiot he comes across with.
2097	Ordos	2013-04-25	I have a feeling that Theon and Boy will be absent from at least the next two episodes unless there is that hunt for Bran and Rickon or the second escape as was mentioned earlier in this thread. And even then, what will Episode 7 bring us but Ramsay torturing Theon?
And If boy reveals his identity in Episode 9 just before the red wedding, how will they go about doing it. Will he just bluntly say it: "You know who I am? Am am the heir to the Dreadfort!" or maybe a soldier walks in bringing a letter and says "Lord Bolton, there is a message from your father..."
2098	Mulled Wino	2013-04-25	@Toxspecific
Quotes from CoK:
Ser Rodrik: "then perhaps Lord Eddard should have kept you chained to a dungeon wall.  Instead he raised you among his own sons, the sweet boys you have butchered, and to my undying shame I trained you in the arts of war."
Luwin: "Theon, once I taught you sums and letters, history and warcraft.  And might have taught you more, had you wished to learn."
That's in 5 minutes of searching through a book. There's just no way he wasnt brought up te same way as Robb morally.  Its crystal clear in the text.
2099	Catherine Storm	2013-04-25	Theon, i believe was definitely brought up as a 'Stark' as @MulledWino quoted above.  He lost his real father at King's Landing and from that point on,  it's kind of where he spiralled out of control.
With Ned dead, who would he look to for guidance? As a Greyjoy, I guess people wouldn't think that Theon would grieve as a 'real' Stark of Winterfell would. But with that father figure gone, he seek Balon, gets nothing, and f*cks up everything to try win some patriarchal love back.
Poor Theon. I pitied him in the books for sure, but when he made his tearful confessions in that scene, he won my heart (he stole it actually so there you go Theon, the iron price).
Still, my fascination with Ramsay lies strong and can't wait for more scenes with these two.
2100	Toxspecific	2013-04-25	@ToxspecificQuotes from CoK:Ser Rodrik: "then perhaps Lord Eddard should have kept you chained to a dungeon wall.

Its crystal clear in the text.So Luwin saying he would have taught more definitely means he was saying he'd have been a parent to him? I don't think so. Maybe he did, but we can never know. I still believe Theon received below par guidance considering his requirement.And I remember Ser Rodrik's words well. He was exaggerating, and not exaggerating at the same time; it was more of an angry "you ungrateful bastard" speech. Rodrik was telling Theon he was well treated for a hostage.

I don't have the book in front of me, but that quote from Theon just touched me a lot.Yeah. Theon exaggerated by saying that too though, he was getting emotional. Just like Rodrik was.It's like a situation where I have an advantage over a guy as his captor but I treat him way better than people in his position are treated and one day he betrays me and I feel enraged and say 'I treated you like fucking gold' even though I didn't.

I mean, it isn't really an exaggeration that he could never forget that he could be killed at any time. Also, Stockholm Syndrome is ridiculously prevelant in the ASOIAF world, it seems, lol.
2104	Mulled Wino	2013-04-25	So Luwin saying he would have taught more definitely means he was saying he'd have been a parent to him? I don't think so. Maybe he did, but we can never know.

No, he was saying he was treated the same as the Stark boys.  Remember, I contend that Thein was taught morals and raised well enough to be fairly well adjusted.  Im not contendig he had a loving father figure.  He had enough parenting/education that I'm not going him a pass for having it sooooo hard.  It wasnt that hard for him.  He ran with the Lord of Winterfell's oldest son, appeared to have every luxury that Robb had except an especially warm mother and father (which he didnt have at Pyke anyway).  He was out banging girls in the town and all around WF.  He went on all the big hunts and was present for everything Robb was for the most part.  This notion that life was a struggle for Theon because he didnt have a loving father doesnt hold weight as an excuse or reason to justify his actions. He was an arrogant self-entitled prick to everyone.  There waa that line with Esgred where she says something along the lines of "Balon Greyjoy is a grest man". And he responds with, "No, he gave birth to a great man."

Play some maniacal music in the background and he can cackle too.  I guess it has to be right efore the RW, otherwise it's super easy to put together that Roose is a traitor.  My only issue with this last scene is that the beginning of his "redemption arc" (or whatever you want to call it) is too soon, too forced.  Alfie Allen's acting made me almost tear up hearing him talk about Ned being his father, but I don't think this dialogue is really necessary yet.  D&D and writers have no sense of subtlety...we have what - seasons to drag this out?  Theon doesn't need to spew a bunch of stuff to try to generate sympathy quite yet.

D&D and writers have no sense of subtlety...we have what - seasons to drag this out?  Theon doesn't need to spew a bunch of stuff to try to generate sympathy quite yet.I think they're just trying REALLY hard to make sure that most of the audience, at least, doesn't *enjoy* Theon's torture ... like, you aren't supposed to be thinking "Yes, he is totally getting what he deserves" ... ppl were supposed to go "Awww" and feel a bit bad for him in that scene ... and now everything that follows will be more sympathetic and horrible. I know it's DIFFERENT from the way it worked in the books, but the same motivation is there.
2108	Toxspecific	2013-04-25	Id say Beth in the noose ratcheted things up a good bit.  OuchDepends. Wasn't Ser Rodrik's quoted words before Theon told him he'd kill Beth?
2109	teemo	2013-04-25	Iwan Rheon is ridiculously hot.
2110	Mulled Wino	2013-04-25	Depends. Wasn't Ser Rodrik's quoted words before Theon told him he'd kill Beth?Rodrik's were but the quote Jen brought up about the rope around theons neck weren't.  I'll always remember Rodrik's reaction: "Viper!"
2111	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-25	Maybe they reveal Ramsay's identity when someone makes the mistake of calling him Snow. Up until now show!Ramsay acts like a gleeful but controlled sadist.  Even killing his men looked ice cold. I think at some point D&D are going to show just how volatile he is, in comparison to Roose and the like.

2113	Lady Arwen	2013-04-25	No, he was saying he was treated the same as the Stark boys.  Remember, I contend that Thein was taught morals and raised well enough to be fairly well adjusted.  Im not contendig he had a loving father figure.  He had enough parenting/education that I'm not going him a pass for having it sooooo hard.  It wasnt that hard for him.  He ran with the Lord of Winterfell's oldest son, appeared to have every luxury that Robb had except an especially warm mother and father (which he didnt have at Pyke anyway).  He was out banging girls in the town and all around WF.  He went on all the big hunts and was present for everything Robb was for the most part.  This notion that life was a struggle for Theon because he didnt have a loving father doesnt hold weight as an excuse or reason to justify his actions.I humbly agree with every word in this quote! Well said!

Just like when he executed Skinner, he was already on his knees dying slowly until he said "Bastard" the Boy simply stood up in from and slammed an arrow onto his head at point blank.
2115	Lord Kyle	2013-04-26	This whole storyline is mad dumb. What's wrong with just having Ramsay introduce himself and torture Theon? If they wanna have that escape-plot twist event why not use the one from the book? 
This whole plotline was created just to keep Allen in the show, and its being needlessly dragged out as well.
2116	buttface	2013-04-26	I wasn't a fan. It didn't seemed a little premature to me. I didn't start to have sympathy for Theon until he reappeared as Reek all eating rats and stuff but at this point in the show I still kind of hate him.
2117	Toxspecific	2013-04-26	Still, even if Theon had gotten good parenting (no, permission to run around WF whoring and partying as much as he wants is not grooming or anything), him effing up in a situation of war, which he's never experienced before, is still understandable.
2118	Joyful Union	2013-04-26	This whole storyline is mad dumb. What's wrong with just having Ramsay introduce himself and torture Theon? If they wanna have that escape-plot twist event why not use the one from the book?This whole plotline was created just to keep Allen in the show, and its being needlessly dragged out as well.Because Ramsay hadn't already been introduced, and they want him to be shown as sneeky as he is in the books. Also, you cant just have the same repetitive torture scenes for a whole seasons, they made it more interesting. They also couldnt just make Allen disappear for several seasons.
2119	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-26	This whole storyline is mad dumb. What's wrong with just having Ramsay introduce himself and torture Theon? If they wanna have that escape-plot twist event why not use the one from the book?This whole plotline was created just to keep Allen in the show, and its being needlessly dragged out as well.Because in the show, Ramsay is said to be acting on Roose and Robb's orders. You can't portray him as being a psycho and revealing that he burnt Winterfell without casting a great deal of suspicion on the Boltons. And I think showing Theon's torture will be as effective, if not more, than telling the viewers about it.
2120	Toxspecific	2013-04-26	This storyline isn't dumb, its amazing. Its giving us extra Theon time.
2121	'96Buck	2013-04-26	Love Theon but I thought the Boltons were unaware of the Starks boys being alive.The fact that Theon told Ramsay about them(so quickly) makes Theon looks moronic and Ramsay look like Einstein imoBoltons most certainly have always known, in the book, that the Starks escaped.
2122	'96Buck	2013-04-26	This whole storyline is mad dumb. What's wrong with just having Ramsay introduce himself and torture Theon? If they wanna have that escape-plot twist event why not use the one from the book?This whole plotline was created just to keep Allen in the show, and its being needlessly dragged out as well.It's establishing how sadistic and psycho Ramsay is.  He ACTUALLY did a fake escape to teach Theon...we're just seeing it (a little different) instead of it being a memory of Theon's.  What will Theon's reaction be, next time, if someone is rescuing him?
2123	Pure Guava	2013-04-26	The storyline is wicked fun. Why do some of you hate fun?
2124	Nezzer	2013-04-26	The storyline is wicked fun. Why do some of you hate fun?This. It's the storyline I have been enjoying the most this season so far and I am very glad they didn't cut Theon from season 3.

2126	Toxspecific	2013-04-26	The show's take on Theon's arc is overflowing with quality.
2127	Voshed	2013-04-26	Awesome story line....definatly agree with opinion regarding the nature of his upbringing with his surrogate family/geolers...he certainly wasn't slumming it. i can see however his need to re-connect with isproper family and try and prove himself to his birth father. The reality must have been devastating when he realized his mistake. Escape and intro to Ramsey....Awesome....lest see just what a sadistic basterd he is...mmmm...somehow don't think HBO will get away with a little skinning and toe snipping
2128	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-26	I love fun, it's definitely way up there with one of my favorite storylines so far this season /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />Thirding.Plus, it combines two storylines that would be missing otherwise. Ramsay being deceptive (a la ACOK) and Ramsay letting Theon think he escaped as a sick joke (since D&D don't show flashbacks).

2129	Tyrion4President	2013-04-26	did I ever say he burned down winterfell?  His actions LEAD to that happening, but he also beheaded the men he once served with, and had two chidlren, killed.  Theon doesn't deserve sympathy.  He was taken away from a father, who is a diguisting peron.  He was given a good life, in Winterfell.  He was raised as a lord, right along side every Stark child, and was treated better then Jon Snow.  I don't see Jon, killing children, and betraying his family.  Theon is a pathetic person, who is desperatly seeking approval because of his own shortcomings.  He deserves everything that is coming to him, plain and simple.  Go watch the Stark children SCREAMING and CRYING as he beheaded Ser Rodrick, as he whacks and slices, and kicks his head off.  Go watch that and tell me he deserves any form of sympathy.  He was given everything... and threw it all away because he was jealouse of his sister.Theon is really a weak minded person who has listened to too many other people. He hasnt exactly made any important decisions on his own without being influenced by an outside source. Yes it was wrong the way he handled things but put yourself in his shoes. Your whole life your raised by another family with different values of his real family. All his life he thought about why his father gave him up so easily. When he returned to pyke he was emotionally vulnerable. His father was ashamed of him. He had lost the family that had raised him aswell. He wanted to be apart of something and his fathers words swayed him into proving his heritage. Think about it in that perspective and then maybe you will be a little more compasionate for him.
2130	bobbybuilderton	2013-04-27	I liked the "my real father" line because I didn't hear it as this "aww I loved that guy" line, it was more an objective fact that he was coming to--which is that Ned treated him more like a father than his father ever did. Even if he was kept at a distance and felt out of place, it was better than his biological father received him. Robb at least let him fight with him, which is a big deal if you're there due to your father's possible rebellion (remember, these people believe treason runs in your blood). Which is more than his father did. He was right there next to Robb when he captured an important prisoner. His father looks at him, scoffs, and tells him to go bully a bunch of fishermen.Also, I think the point of leading him in a circle is so that when Kyra/random prisoner escapes and tries to take him along, at that point he will already be slipping into the Reek persona because he won't want to leave Ramsay because it's safe. And he will start to look at any sign of hope as a trick (often the case in the books).Wouldn't it be sick if they added a scene of Ramsay watching someone flay Theon while ejaculating on him? That's another smell mixed in for Reek. Seems like the sort of pointless sex thing that would be added to the show, and verifies that Ramsay is a sick bastard. Though they don't really show many male sexual things, just women. Also, was it ever stated that Ramsay actually told Roose that Bran and Rickon were alive? I don't see why he wouldn't, but Manderly seemed to be under the impression that he was clueless when he sent Davos. Or maybe I just thought he was under that impression since he didn't want them to know he was on to their secret.The fact that Theon talked makes sense with his character to me. A person who's spent their entire life looking for some place they feel accepted will open up pretty easily once they believe they have that. Alfie even mentioned it in that interviewIt's indicative of how badly Theon needed to be understood by anyone that he pours his heart out to this total stranger, even if he did save his life.He wants to be everyone's friend. [Laughs] He just wants to be accepted, by anyone, at this point especially. He just sort of spills his guts to this guy â<U+0080><U+0093> I guess he's doing it to himself more than anything, you know what I mean?

It'd be really awkward...

2134	Toxspecific	2013-04-27	I just hated it so much, no matter how beneficial it was for his character arc, that Theon left the Northern cause. He was a freaking Greyjoy fighting for the North - that was pretty epic in itself.

I think either Kyra or someone else will "escape" (more like the guard purposely let her steal the key under Ramsay's orders), they try to grab Theon and bring him along, but Theon is now super paranoid about any sign of hope. She convinces him she's not working for Ramsay, and Theon goes. They get captured, Ramsay makes Theon watch as he flays her and makes it clear that it's what will happen to him next. After that, Theon doesn't trust anyone and his real descent into Reek starts due to his view that compliance with Ramsay will get him less harm. And then we forget about him for a few episodes, when we come back he's lost fingers and his hair is gone white.Or that's all terrible shite. I won't quit my day job...

But yeah I know it's gross and horrible, I wasn't using sick in the colloquial sense.
ETA: OH and not to mention beheading horses out of blind fury, cutting off the tops of heads, closeup of breast feeding by boy that's far too old for it. All of these things would have been "what the hell?" to show on tv 40 years ago, I believe. Scandalous 30 years ago even, perhaps. Someone had to be the first. It started somewhere.

But fortunately for us we live in a conservative enough society that a man ejaculating on another man's face as he's being tortured is crossing the line way too far for a TV series on a prestigious cable network. And for that I'm actually thankful!
2150	bobbybuilderton	2013-04-27	I didn't mean "hey let's get a closeup of the actor's cock and fake semen coming out," by the way. If they are willing to imply oral sex being performed, why would they be above showing Ramsay masturbate or something while someone tortures Theon?
2151	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-27	I didn't mean "hey let's get a closeup of the actor's cock and fake semen coming out," by the way. If they are willing to imply oral sex being performed, why would they be above showing Ramsay masturbate or something while someone tortures Theon?Actually, no. Showing Ramsay's face as he's quite obviously pleasuring himself (He could undo his breeches and then the camera cuts to his head) would be a bit subjective. "Is he really doing that? Am I perverted for even thinking it?" That could possibly pass on HBO, but for sure it will be mega disturbing and I think they would draw too much negativity toward the show to try to execute that. I do have to say that his maniacal taste for torture could be sexually arousing for him, but I think if they even had the gaul to attempt that it would be from a distance and not, you know, a money shot.You have to ask what they would gain from that, though. Yes, it would make Ramsay clearly more disturbing and despicable, but would it be in the right way? Would it be overboard, for the sake of shock value, just to say "We're HBO and we can do anything." Would it make viewers sympathize with Theon more, or make them reluctant to even view his character arc? I think it's drawing the line too close. Would HBO be breaking the mold by conceiving something so graphic? Too many people would be offended to thus justify breaking a barrier, in my opinion.

2156	SerMudz	2013-04-28	Theon is not one of the best characters in ASOIAF, he's THE BEST. I've been arguing this since I joined the forum. The show is only strengthening my view.Each to their own I suppose....I've never seen the appeal in Theon, and I struggle to find any sympathy for him. Jaime Lannister will always bA© the best character in the series for me. Now theres a character who I have the utmost sympathy for, despite having done a truly horrible act.Theon doesnt get any, because the reasons for the horrible things he's done arent good enough. He decapitated Ser Rodrik simply so his men would respect him more. He ok'd the murder of two innocent children just so he wouldnt look stupid for losing the stark kids.I wouldnt say he deserves torture but he certainly deserves to die.
2157	Valonqar_	2013-04-28	It's curious but I was just realizing how they had made show Joffrey almost as creepy as book Ramsay linking (in a relative subtle way) his sadism with his sexual-drive and I was wondering if that meant they could make show Ramsay also more psychotic (not necessarily in the same way)

2159	Toxspecific	2013-04-28	Theon is not one of the best characters in ASOIAF, he's THE BEST. I've been arguing this since I joined the forum. The show is only strengthening my view.This.Theon is the best written character in the series. Now I'll explain something weird. When I think of a character, my mind produces a mental image. This seems to vary for each character. Most of these images are colours or shapes... When I think of Theon I get a whole mix of images, varying and changing, as I read his chapters. Okay I'll stop with the senseless blabbering lol what I'm trying to say, is that he is so freaking enigmatic, so conflicted, so deep.Jaime Lannister's redemption arc is great but doesn't compare to Theon's, considering Jaime had justification for the crimes he was accused of. Theon didn't think he could justify his, and is rotting with regret for it.Theon also lost more than Jaime did. In fact, Theon never had as much happiness as Jaime did.
2160	BananaSpice	2013-04-28	Has GRRM ever talked about Theon's character? I think I remember reading somewhere that he considers him one of the most misunderstood characters, but it would be fascinating to pick his brain about Theon. I was just wondering if this had been done in any interviews or videos before. Maybe we'll get more of that in the future with season 3 ...

We all have our favourite characters and for me Theon just wasnt that memorable I guess. Diff'rent strokes.Agreed, although they do have valid points of views as to why Theon deserves better treatment. Then, again if you think the actions he did with the mind of a 12th century medieval knight.... I am pretty sure they would recruit him for the crusades and made sure he died on them.

I am pretty sure they would recruit him for the crusades and made sure he died on them.I think you hit the nail on the head.Here in England everyone reveres Richard the Lionheart.He was King of England for a decade and he spent all but 6 months of his reign abroad slaughtering god knows how many in the name of Christianity!By todays standards that would be genocide. By 12 th century standards he was simply doing his Kingly dutyTheon wasnt too bad by Medieval standards really.
2164	Jason Ironborn.	2013-04-28	Yeah, Theon is the best character IMO. I became a fan in ACOK as his chapters were great (even though he was pretty hateful), but the Reek/Prince/Ghost of Winterfell chapters are the highlight of ADWD for me.
Alfie Allen is killing it too. The people I watch the shows with are already feeling bad for him.
2165	Pure Guava	2013-04-28	Alfie Allen is killing it too.Yep. Shame what Theon did and what he's about to go through but damn if AA isn't going to pull it off like a boss. In fact, IW + AA is going to = something pretty magical if they stick with it and flesh it out well.

2166	Ordos	2013-04-29	Since Theon is absent from episode 5, does anyone have any thoughts on the preview for episode 6 where Boy says 'If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention'?
Wonder if episode 6 will be the reveal of Boy's identity. I had thought that Boy and Theon would sit out several episodes until at least epidode 8. Unless of course there is anything more interesting other than just Theon being tortured.
2167	DemonKing	2013-04-29	The whole torture thing seems a bit daft to me...Ramsey releases Theon and then kills four guys just so it makes Theon's return to prison that much worse? Maybe he had a bow and is a crack shot but still taking on four guys singlehandedly is a pretty big risk...and also pretty wasteful unless they were mercenaries or otherwise expendable. Then, when they get back to the torture chamber, he bleats out "He killed the others!" which makes it seem like he might be in big trouble if the deaths of the other four become apparent - which Theon will no doubt tell them about under torture. It's just messy, over-complicated the clumsy to me. Far better to have him either release Theon and then hunt him down en masse with the other guys and drag him back or simply lead him on a circuitous route back to the torture chamber if you really want to make him suffer.

He is probably one of the few cut and dry evil characters in the story. He knows it's a risk. He enjoys the chase. Upping the risk and doubling the number of parties he's hunting makes it that much more thrilling for him. He likes to hunt the most dangerous game. So hunting the most dangerous game while the most dangerous game is hunting the most dangerous game is probably like heaven to him. And as far as Theon cracking under pressure, I assume it could easily be fixed by having him flay Theon a bit in private, tell him that if he tells the others that it was actually him that killed the guards he'll get it worse. The guy tells Reek in the books that he's going to take another finger just because daddy is taking him away. Theon didn't do anything but be necessary for Arya's wedding. The guy is seriously just messed up.
2169	DemonKing	2013-04-29	The guy is seriously just messed up.Maybe so but you would not expect such a character to last very long. Sooner or later he'll be found out and killed unless of course Daddy has left him in charge and he has some level of authoritas that makes his men fear and/or respect him - or his father - enough to let him get away with the crazy stuff. Even then, "mad" monarchs throughout history almost inevitably had pretty short reigns that ended badly. In any case, that doesn't seem to be the situation in the TV show.As I said - it's just clumsy to me.

2170	caliquenor	2013-05-08	Alfie Allen does a great job with Theon, but I can't wait to see how iwan Rheon develops Ramsey. He is a great actor, and can be really creepy (as needed here). For those who don't know him, he was part of British show Misfits, really great role...
2171	WinterKing	2013-04-21	I am curious about it.
2172	Lany Cassandra	2013-04-21	My husband knew that Dany would likely kille the slaver and he suspected that it was the Lord Commander's watch that was ending.
He LOVED the episode.  A lot going on.
2173	LordStoneheart	2013-04-21	Same here. My brother predicted exactly what Daenerys would do. Down to turning the army against the masters.
2174	Nuncle Kraken	2013-04-21	I was so into the final scene. I look over and my nephew was standing with his fists balled up. Lol. He looks at me and says "I HAVE to read the books!". 
Hell yes.
2175	The Ghost of Winter	2013-04-21	They all knew what Dany was going to do. 
And they were also surprised when poor Theon was led back to the torture chamber.

I do kind of hope they wrap this point up or give a clue soon, because as intriguing as the answer to Winterfell's fate and the implications of what it means is, I could see the mystery wearing old after too long when you have no idea what the fuck.There's a lot of love for Margaery and the Queen of Thorns, and an eagerness to see Sansa being rescued by someone other than LF. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />

Oh, and he also said that Sansa seems to be getting hotter every episode, something which I totally agree with /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
2197	KoishNoish	2013-04-22	A friend of mine is convinced that Dany and Robb are going to ally with one another to defeat Tywin and as he said, "I want one of the dragons to eat Joffrey right now!". Another of mine predicted the Dany scene but didn't predict the use of the dragon on the slave master and he is pretty convinced Dany isn't going to win. i asked him why and he just shrugged.
2198	brAnthelAstgreenseer	2013-04-22	Most of my friends were shocked by Ramsay bringing Theon back.That was a real twist for them.Also they did not think the bear would die like that.They had predicted Dany will not give him the dragon but again liked it when she spoke in Valyrian.

2203	Sun	2013-04-22	My non-readers loved it. Their hearts broke for Jaime. They thought he was badass for fighting with one hand (I think it was a suicide by Bolton attempt), and Brienne badass for trying to help him.
They're confused by Catelyn showing up in Bran's dream, I'm not quite sure what to make of it either, actually.
They think Marg will have Joff throughly broken in before the end of the season.
They loved Dany's finale. The only problem is, they now all think she'll be in Westeros by the end of the season. I didn't have the heart to disabuse them of that notion... let them dream while they can.

2205	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-04-22	They all loved Dany scenes, of course.
My Dad is wondering how she is going to feed all those people though and thinks she should have stayed in Astapor and took over the city to feed her army. lol
My parents think Brienne will save Jaime. My hubby thinks Jaime deserves all of it because he is evil to his core b/c he threw Bran out of the window.
My mom can't stand Tywin and she and my Dad think he should call Cersei out on her twincest. lol
My Dad is really worried about Sansa and thinks she'll be leaving with Littlefinger the next episode and he hates Littlefinger. He also is majorly worried about the Hound because that's one of his favorite characters. He doesn't think that guy can beat him but I think he can sense that something is up. For some reason, my Dad still thinks Arya is going to get her own army or something. I'm like "Dude! She's 9!"
My hubby was completely thrown off and confused about Theon and boy. That one hasn't completely registered yet and he doesn't understand why Theon didn't recognize where he was being led. He did say that "So, he did that whole thing to get him to confess that the Stark boys are still alive?"
Also, my Dad thinks that the Nights Watch is ended and what will they do w/o a leader.

To be honest, though, that last scene was really powerful and did seem to suggest that she's coming.... Do you think that the writers are heading in that direction?? It would be a huge deviation from the books, one that I'd hate (because non-readers need to see how irritating and whiny she is) but I think I can see it happening. Dany is a powerful card for the show, and I think D&D would want to make better use of her, rather than having her sit in Meereen

Another is pretty sure Jaime will be killed by Robb and Sansa will be forced to flee with Littlefinger as the Lannisters will want to repay in kind.

Everyone agrees that Varys is one scary dude

2215	cybobbie	2013-04-22	Everyone here loved the episode, specially because of the Dracary's scene, but they had lots of questions too. The main issue here at home is about Theon, they still don't get who is keeping him captive from start and why the boy took him back and specially why the boy is such a good fighter with arrows and sill submit to this gang that has Theon, so this part is kind of a mess for them. I try to avoid saying things to them and this time was almost impossible!
Another hot topic of discussion here was Marg, I mean some of my friends believe that she can't be trusted regarding all her friendship attempts with Sansa. However they are not going against the Tyrell's family as a whole because they love the Queen of Thorns.
One funny thing was that after the end my mom simply said to herself - "I wonder how Dany will be able to keep all this army"!
2216	Dove	2013-04-22	Yeah, one of my favorite comments was someone saying, "Wait, so how is she (Daenerys) going to keep all those men fed?"
welp, welcome to the next 3+ years of Dany's story
I have to wonder if they set up all the Craster "WE WANT FOOD" mutiny stuff with Dany's liberation of her new army so that would be on people's minds.

2217	Young Nan	2013-04-22	My husband is  Dany fanboy now and thinks she is just such an awesome badass. 
I tried to explain how she left the city worse off than before, that astapor is "eroeh" all over again, but he just thinks its cool how she freed the slaves.  
little does he know she spends the next three books drooling over Daario's sexy blue mustache and eating lots of figs and olives while trying on new sandals and tokars.

Even though it might seem to us viewers  that Theon has now lost his trust in 'Boy', I think he is very confused, and that Ramsay may well use this previously gained trust to mess with his head further.
2219	Ser Loudmouth	2013-04-22	My brother had expected that Drogon would burn Astapor all by himself and then fly back to Dany in the next episode.
2220	Rapsie	2013-04-22	Excellent and bizarre comments by the other half.
"We'll that's dark" about Varys keeping a man in a box. 
"She's a blatant lesbian" in reference to Dany.
After the the sack of Astapor. "F****, three dragons and an army of hard bastards, my money's on her now." 
"She's going to be evil isn't she" in reference to the Marg / Sansa scene.
"Poor girl. She's so stupid." In reference to Sansa in the Marg / Sansa scene.  (This did cause a little "discussion")
"Oh mate" in reference to Theon. Me: yeah it's not going to get better for him until about Season 6.

2222	shiola	2013-04-22	Someone thinks Dany will fall in love with Jon and that Barristan is actually her real father, NOT the King.Oh my god.  That's so soap opera.  And he was in the Kingsguard and takes vows very seriously, so I doubt he'd sleep with a woman.  And I can't imagine he could have gotten close enough to her mother in order to father her.  Interesting theory though.
2223	jons nissa	2013-04-22	one of my non-readers said she was very nervous about the tyrells being nice to sansa because everyone who is nice to her winds up screwing her over. she then went on to say that sansa's best bet was with the pimp. i thought she meant tyrion but no, she meant littlefinger. when i asked my friend if she thought littlefinger was trustworthy after double crossing ned and lying to cat, she said no, but that it was the only way sansa could get out of king's landing. she said, she's not too bright getting all excited about marrying loras because she knows nothing about him but she deserves a break. she kept saying she deserves a break.
she also loved dracarys and said her boyfriend predicted the whole scene perfectly.
2224	Kellyline	2013-04-22	Almost everyone I talked to suspected Dany wouldn't give away her dragons, so I think last week's episode made it pretty clear.
People are confused about the Night's Watch rebellion and the whole Theon/Ramsey "escape"
For some unknown reason my Dad believes Sansa wants to get back with Joffery and is jealous of Margery for getting to marry him. Which I find really absurd and hilarious. I've tried to explain to him that Sansa loaths him and does not want to marry him.
People are also starting to sympathize with Theon and Jaime.
2225	WinterKing	2013-04-22	I just looked at TWoP forums and the unspoiled are still confused about Theon and Boy, hope that now Dany will conquer Westeros,are,for some reason, thinking that Margeary is as evil as Joffrey and that as TBWoB follow the R'hllor they will burn Gendry and they are servants of melisandre.Strange ideas...
2226	shiola	2013-04-22	My friend knows Sansa's about to get screwed...  But I think anyone can see that.
2227	PatrickStormborn	2013-04-22	My friends are sure that Dany is on her way to Westeros, and get mad at me for my condescending "yeah, sure" /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />.  To be honest, though, that last scene was really powerful and did seem to suggest that she's coming.... Do you think that the writers are heading in that direction?? It would be a huge deviation from the books, one that I'd hate (because non-readers need to see how irritating and whiny she is) but I think I can see it happening. Dany is a powerful card for the show, and I think D&D would want to make better use of her, rather than having her sit in Meereen The reason the scene suggested she was coming is because, at this point, Dany still intends to march West through Slaver's Bay and Essos, liberating cities and plundering resources to fund her eventual campaign for the throne. She doesn't even think of remaining in Slaver's Bay until she hears that Astapor has fallen again.
2228	Lady Lea	2013-04-22	My dad, about Dany: "that's a dangerous woman"
2229	ohpooratlas	2013-04-22	My boyfriend only had two comments.1.) He's pretty sure Beric Donderian is going to kill the Hound. 2.) He does not think Dany is coming to Westeros any time soon.  He's pretty certain she's going to "stay on that continent and take over more cities" (that continent being Essos.)So ... he's half right.
2230	Spring Snow	2013-04-22	My friend knows Sansa's about to get screwed...  But I think anyone can see that.In a way, it's a double-edged sword to show Margaery being so clever and scheming already. We know that the Tyrells wanting to marry Sansa into the family is ultimately self-serving, but a lot of people are assuming that Margaery is actively out to harm her for some reason.
2231	Jasta11	2013-04-22	A non-reader friend of mine almost got tears of joy at Dracarys and declared Dany's story can finally get better. Yeah, sadly it's only downhill from there...
Also, my mum (who watches the show almost only for the Starks and Night's Watch) is getting tired of the lack of Robb and co, and said that after Mormont, not more ''good'' characters need to die this season. I think the show will lose a watcher come RW.
2232	shiola	2013-04-22	My friend doesn't understand what happened to the Dothraki that Dany proposed to trade for the Unsullied.

2234	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	Assuming your friend has read the books, I think a fair interpretation is that Ramsay does what he does for his own very personal enjoyment, and also as a stage in the process of reekifying Theon. Even though it might seem to us viewers  that Theon has now lost his trust in 'Boy', I think he is very confused, and that Ramsay may well use this previously gained trust to mess with his head further.He hasn't read the books, so he remains thoroughly confused. I explained that it will make more sense down the road. He was still confused about who burned Winterfell, and correctly guessed that it was the Bastard of Bolton, but I wouldn't confirm it for the sake of spoiling events for him. He started reading ASOS, but I convinced him to start from the beginning, as the changes in the show would only confuse him further.Oh, and everyone loves Daenerys now. It's hard not to tell them that her arc goes downhill from here.

2236	lostinwesteros	2013-04-22	They don't understand the Ramsay/Theon scenes at all, totally confused by it.
2237	Maester Ruin	2013-04-22	i know a lot of unsullied who were confused by Berics introduction scene. the build up for his reveal and the way he stepped in made it look like he was an already established character making a dramatic reappearance, like it was ned stark suddenly walking in with his head intact or something.
lots of friends went like "wait, who is this guy? am i supposed to recognize him?"
2238	YourMomsBox	2013-04-22	I think Daenerys's storyline will deviate. I highly doubt they'd go from something as epic as that to just chilling as ruler of Mereen. I think this season her Unsullied with battle with a Dothraki army. Seems possible that Drogo's previous followers might war with her.

I think this season her Unsullied with battle with a Dothraki army. Seems possible that Drogo's previous followers might war with her.I think there will be deviations, but not too great. GRRM seems to have put a lot of effort into developing things in Meereen to a climax we just haven't seen yet.If anything they might move Meereen closer to Volantis so it least appears that she is headed in the right direction instead of cooling her heels. This might also explain the non presence of Meereen on the map in the opening credits.

2240	victim	2013-04-23	It shall lose more than one; it is known. /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />For every viewer it loses, it'll gain two. People will be upset, they'll talk about it in turn exposing the show to new viewers, but not all will quit the series. How many people do you know that quit the books after the Red Wedding? If anything, I wanted to read it more after that chapter.
2241	Archana The Brown Walker	2013-04-23	"Wow, this Daenerys is so awesome! She always makes the right decisions! I can't wait to see her invade Westeros and unite with Robb to fight the Lannisters by the end of this season!"Not that anybody I know said this, but I wouldn't be surprised if they didOne can only hope. It seems that Dany will invade westeros in the last episode this year. She will probably meet Cat in the first episode next season to discuss the terms of alliance. An alliance of ice and fire, so to speak. Next season will feature the onset of battle between this alliance and lannisters + their allies. In the mean time, Jon will unite wildlings with NW to lead a defence against the white walkers.Non-readers are so innocent, aren't they? Sort of like sheltered 5 year olds who don't know how harsh this world truely is.
2242	Dove	2013-04-23	What makes me smile is how many people still think her name is "Khaleesi" after three years.

This might also explain the non presence of Meereen on the map in the opening credits.There is no Mereen in the opening credits because we haven't visited it yet. For example, they showed Qarth in credits last season. Now that she moved to Astapor, Astapor has replaced Qarth in the credits. Once she moves to Mereen, it will replace Astapor.
2245	Maester Ruin	2013-04-23	the locations shown in the opening credits vary from episode to episode dont they?
2246	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2013-04-23	What makes me smile is how many people still think her name is "Khaleesi" after three years.Yeah, it doesn't seem to matter how many times she says "I am Daenerys Stormborn, of House Targaryen"To those who think she will be in Westeros 'soon' I have just been saying "She is still half a planet away"
2247	GeorgeIAF	2013-04-23	My friends now believe that Theon is tortured by the Ironmen, they have no clue of who Iwan is, but they think that he'll play a major role in the end. Also they expected that Drogon will return to Dany, and they rallied for her in the end. What upset me the most was the fact that at the start of the episode they were all laughing at Jamie and happy to what happened to him, calling him daddy's boy and so on. I think when they will see his true colors, their view of his character will change. I told them that he saved Brienne, when he was not obliged to do it, that shows a glimpse of his changing.
2248	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2013-04-23	the locations shown in the opening credits vary from episode to episode dont they?Yes - where ever the story is taking place. Only deviation I suspect maybe different is with Theon. He could be at the Dreadfort?.
2249	GeorgeIAF	2013-04-23	Exactly and i think that's they arent showing the location, to not giveaway who Iwan really is.
2250	Roose Seal	2013-04-23	Hearing non-readers say that Dany is finally going to Westeros is quickly becoming my favorite thing about this show.
2251	liefde	2013-04-23	Mormont: 'He (GRRM) really does kill everyone...'
Ramsay: 'Whaaat? No, don't tell me.'
2252	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-23	My friend is still convinced that Theon "deserves everything he gets and more". I don't know what's stopping me from grabbing a copy of ADWD and rubbing his face in Reek's chapters, screaming "SEE! YOU STILL THINK HE DESERVES IT? DO YOU! DO YOU!"
....okay, not really. But it is becoming increasingly difficult not to blurt out the details of Theon's torture.
2253	The Ghost of Winter	2013-04-23	My poor mother has no clue what is going on, who the characters are and so on. I need to make her a picture book or something.
2254	Peptalk	2013-04-23	My friend is absolutely certain that Robb will win the Iron throne and that Daenerys will invade Westeros. She also thinks the Starks will be reunited soon and is looking forward to that. Poor creature.

Generally though, everyone thinks Daenerys is so awesome, sadly this is the high point of her story for the next 3 seasons at least.
2258	Eric Xayavong	2013-04-23	Ah. All these Robb/Daenerys hopes remind me of my own reading into aSoS. Daenerys proving herself and Robb forgiven of his slight.
Any my friends general thoughts are:
Daenerys is bad ass.
LF is a big player. 
What is going on with Theon. 
So many questions like,
When is Joffrey going to die?
And I replied he's too powerful, the world is not fair. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />

2259	Nymeria's pup	2013-04-23	I love this thread! I wish I had some non-book people to regularly watch the show with. I would just love to see their reactions. I will be spending time with a non-book reading show watcher this week. I cannot wait to ask her what she thinks! Hopefully I will have something to add to the thread. Keep the info coming.
2260	Don Roberto	2013-04-23	My wife's thoughts:
1. "Good thing for Jaime that he can fight with his left hand". I understand where that comes from, and agree that it was poorly done in the show. Coster-Waldau displays too much skill with his left as he unsheathes the blade, and the scene makes it look like he succumbed for being tired.
2. "Omg, that's the most evil thing anyone has ever done on TV", to Boy's psychological torture of Theon by bringing him back. Though I did explain to her prior to this season that Theon had been captured by the bastard of Bolton, so she's not entirely clueless as to where he is and who's torturing him (though I don't know if she has identified Boy as Ramsay yet, or just one of his cronies).
3. "Wait, Arya was taken captive?". Arya did say so last episode, but I agree it could have been done more emphatically.
4. "Are Jaime and Brienne going to fall in love now?"
5. "Hell yeah, finally things are getting real", to Mormont's death. Not that she disliked the character, but I get where that came from, season 3 had so far been quite eventless, especially the bold and shocking ones that change everything. She also cheered on Craster's death as quite well deserved.
6. "Wow, the Tyrells will completely take over the Lannisters", to Margaery's blatant manipulation of Joffrey and the marriage proposal to Sansa. She also thinks this marriage to Loras is a scheme, since he's so obviously gay.
7. "That's so unfair to the other houses", do Dany's army acquisition. She thinks Dany got a huge army too easily (I disagree, it was a genius and bold plan), and that now she'd easily crush the other houses. This comes partly from her not paying too much attention, since it is said that it's 8,000 Unsullied and in season 1 there's talk of 20,000 Stark men alone (after I corrected her on the numbers, she was more accepting of the situation), but it's also true that, visually, this is the first time the show paints a good picture on the scale of the war, and can be quite intimidating compared to the scant soldier lines shown marching through Westeros.
She also found the Olenna character much more amusing this time, having found her annoying in episode 2. I agree, Diana Rigg's acting was much more in character now, as was the script.
2261	GoldenFleece	2013-04-23	And my sister didn't buy into Daenerys selling her dragons and was thrilled at the ending. She is convinced she will invade Westeros. She also liked what Brienne did for Jaime and felt for him this episode. My mother is also starting to reluctantly sympathize with him now. "Now that he's lost his hand he perhaps isn't as bad anymore..." I am so looking forward to the scene where Jaime and Cersei hump over Joffrey's dead body.  I'm I a sadist :-)  ?
2262	GoldenFleece	2013-04-23	"So excited for Daenerys to invade the Seven Kingdoms and team up with Robb to destroy Joffrey!!"Ha. haha haaAAAA.*sobs*Generally though, everyone thinks Daenerys is so awesome, sadly this is the high point of her story for the next 3 seasons at least.  Nah I thought the battle of Yunkai was even more awesome that the Plaza of Punishment.  She strummed her enemies, even though they knew how ruthless she could be.  Dany has a knack of getting people to underestimate her.
2263	Pvish	2013-04-23	My friend thinks Arya will lead the Brotherhood, team up with her brother and Danny, crush Joffrey, and help Sansa.
Such a sweet summer child, I try to not telling him winter is coming.
PS. This episode really build hope up for many non-reader, they're really optimistic about the show, now.

2264	The_Gallows_Knight	2013-04-23	As a Librarian, I've had people come in asking for the Coles Notes for Game of Thrones. Like a "for Dummies"  *giggle*They want to be spoon fed and just can't keep up with all the characters, dialogue, etc.I can understand them. I didn't read the books until after I had seen season 1 and I had quite a though time keeping track of all the elements in the show and I am not that much of an inattentive watcher.I particularly had a hard time keeping track of the differences between the Kingsguard, the Lannister soliders and the City Watch in Kings Landing. So I can see how non-book readers could be confused by all the characters, places and other elements they are intrduced too.
2265	Myrddin	2013-04-23	I remember reading SoS 13 years ago and having similar thoughts. I was certain that Dany would be at least leaving fro Westeros by the end of the book and that Arya would be reunited with Robb and/or Catelyn (and when that fell through, then she'd be reunited with Jon).
2266	staten8808	2013-04-23	What makes me smile is how many people still think her name is "Khaleesi" after three years.I get that all the time
2267	Stannis' shadow babies	2013-04-23	My mom is also very suspicious of Littlefinger, even before Varys called him one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. She's also quite certain that Robb is toast. In fact, she thinks all Starks are toast and that only Jon will survive (.....)
2268	Ross2013	2013-04-23	When Beric sentenced the Hound to trial by combat, my son said (referring to Beric), "well he'll die..."  (I resisted the urge to say "yeah, he does that alot" and so didn't spoil that aspect anyway).
The TV show just hasn't had the time to build up Beric at all, so not sure if anyone thinks Sandor is in trouble.  I think I remember being more uncertain about the outcome of that fight when I first read ASOS.
2269	The Monkey	2013-04-23	Yeah, people have been talking about Dany and Robb teaming up since S1. I think the show needs a Dany rant about the "Usurper's dogs" to make the Unsullied understand that's never going to happen.
2270	Maester Ruin	2013-04-23	Im so tired of arguing with unsullied who STILL think theon is deserving all the torture he can get. i mean seriously, if you have only watched the series, you should be able to feel some sympathy for him after his abuse from balon and his confessions about Ned right before being recaptured. I mean when i read ASOS i thought theon was dead for sure and that he deserved it, book theon was always less likeable but in the show he really feels three dimensional and sympathetic (to a degree) but the show watchers seem to hate him even more than the book readers.
i fear D&D has made the series too much of a "Justice league, consisting of Robb and Dany, vs the evil Lannisters" story. every non book-reader i know is a Stark/Dany fanboy who laughed at Jamies terrible abuse in this episode. Cant wait for episode 9

I think I remember being more uncertain about the outcome of that fight when I first read ASOS.I can't recall exactly, but I feel like Sandor sort of laughs or mocks Beric in the novels. In the episode he seemed to be somewhat pensive and almost cautious about it when Beric announces he will be fighting. That should give the viewer the idea that he's not a total puss and can actually fight. I don't know if we know for sure that Beric is always resurrected by Thoros until we meet them at Sandor's trial. Up until then it was purely speculation and word of mouth that he could not be "killed."

2279	Alys Karstark	2013-04-24	My friend noticed that Cersei's right hand is a bit twitchy and looks uncomfortable in her scenes for this episode.

She teicked.me into it she would say I don't care much for this show so you can tel me...Like, who else dies? But she is avid now and won't miss the show for nothing. She likes Jaime I think cause when Locke was abusing him last episode, she  went "Ooooooh no!!!" and later she said "It 's awful how they mistreat that poor boy". I thought she meant Theon but she when I said that  she said "No no I mean the Kingslayer!". She is still unspoiled about a lot of things to come. I learned my lesson (its more fun to watch her yell in shock).Mom's predictions:Arya will be very powerful and will have an army!

Sansa: Because the truth is either terrible, or boring. [Littlefinger approaches]
My brother: How fitting for someone who is both to enter the scene.
2289	Harrad	2013-04-24	The unsullied don't mind the twists and turns. Quite the opposite. Season 3 is accelerating like a buzz saw.
2290	boojam	2013-04-24	I was surprised nobody caught on that Dany understood what the slave on the Walk o' Punishment said to her.You are right , no I did not catch that.I did notice that when Kraznys said "The bitch has her army." That Missandei did not translate that.But Dany gave him the 'your ass is toast' look!Kraznys did not realize she understood what he had said.
2291	The Giver	2013-04-24	My sister thinks the hound will survive his fight, and that he will take Arya back home, since he likes her sister.
It was so hard keeping a straight face.
She also think Dany is heading to Westeros to fight Joffrey, and that she will side with Robb.

2292	lannistergold	2013-04-25	They thought the Boy was really on Theon's side. I can imagine how that would sting.
As for last episode, Jaime not being able to fight his way out of Locke's captivity (before losing his hand) seems to have come as a surprise.

2294	aedalia	2013-04-25	My work friend is completely shocked by everything. He wasn't expecting Dracarys at all.
Every week I warn him not to spoil himself because it ruins everything.
2295	hollowcrown	2013-04-25	Saw some post on Tumblr noting that boy Tallisa and Daenerys spoke Valyrian with a speculation of a connection between the two of them.
Oh non-book readers you're so clueless.
2296	Gheimhridh ag teacht	2013-04-25	They're so pumped about Dany's "inevitable invasion of Westeros now."Sweet summer children.This!I had to fake an excited smile as my friend went on and on about how awesome it's going to be when Dany hits Westeros, and King's Landing...yup! /blushing.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':blushing:' />Also, despite how Hollywood the dracarys was, it really was so exciting to watch - felt really close to how I'd pictured it reading it!  Wasn't COMPLETELY sold on Emilia Clarke until that moment - but I believe her now.Overall, I think this was the most exciting episode for my non-reader co-watcher...it had it all.And they gave Lord Mormont a great exit...I teared up! The stories felt well fleshed out this week, and there wasn't a major amount of hopping.  There's some excitement in my house about Sansa and Loras, so I had to hide my confused face on that one - and on the Spider and Queen of Thorns unlikely friendship, though it's pretty believable for the show.  Lot's of 'who's he' and 'what's he doing' about Boy, so excited to see where that's taking us.All in all, I thought this was the easiest episode of the third series to watch with a non-reader...not as many confused questions at the end, trying to get to grips with the story.  Solid!
2297	Alys Karstark	2013-04-25	From my non-reader brother: When the Unsullied ranks were presented, he commented that their shield look like a big nipple. When they marched out of Astapor, it looked like an army of nipples ready to avenge their fallen brother from episode 1.
2298	Belacel	2013-04-26	My (non-book-reader) husbandâ<U+0080><U+0099>s impressions after the fourth episode are mostly the same as everyone else :
What is the boyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s game with Theon? Is he a sadist or what?
Poor Sansa. Margery is playing with her.
The Hound will win his trial by combat.
How is Dany to feed all these soldiers? They will go all the way to Westeros on foot? (I showed him a map).
Where it gets more interesting :
He predicted Mormontâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death.
He also predicted, from the episodeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s title, that Jorah Mormontâ<U+0080><U+0099>s watch over Dany would be over and that he would have to leave her...

2300	Belacel	2013-04-26	Your husband is quite perceptive. You should be proud! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />And I haven't told him a thing. I look forward to another of his predictions: the death of Catelyn, Robb and Shae.He predicts Jon Snow will sit on the Iron Throne in the end.... but the jury is still out on this one! I believe it will end in a confederation of sorts.
2301	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-26	He predicts Jon Snow will sit on the Iron Throne in the end.... but the jury is still out on this one! I believe it will end in a confederation of sorts.I just hope he's not the "I told you so" kind of person!
2302	Belacel	2013-04-26	I just hope he's not the "I told you so" kind of person!He is.... And he also believes Brienne. Loras and Theon will die. /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' /> If I remember correctly Loras is near death, and Theon dies (figuratively speaking). As for Brienne, who knows?
2303	teemo	2013-04-26	Just finished re-watching with a friend who hasn't seen it yet.  She still can't get over Jaime's hand and thinks it will "humble him."  She thought the mutiny was really random and didn't understand why it happened.  She called it "cray." lol.  Can't believe the NW would do it to their own men. When I told her what happened in the books she said that made a lot more sense and wishes they did it that way (would have been difficult).  
Confused as hell by Theon story and begged me to tell her who "boy" is.  She begs for so many spoilers that we've come to an agreement that I'll give her one for every ten times she asks, lol.  She is really excited to see Jon Snow's dick this weekend.  She says Varys reminds her of LF, they're both people from nothing that are ambitious and want to be on the top.  She doesn't get them at all but says they're very smart.  Margaery and QoT are very cunning.
She thinks Theon has already redeemed himself basically.  Not so much for Jaime.  She thinks he deserved it.  When I mentioned the deaths Theon caused she said he was just "crazy in the head" at the time.  Funny how she holds Theon and Jaime to much different standards. 
She thinks Sansa is a complete idiot for trusting the Tyrells and that she's naive and "should have learned her listen."  When I said, "do you trust the Tyrells with Sansa?"  she screamed NOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lol.  Her feelings for Brienne are on the fence.  She really seems to like the BwB and says they seem like "heroes."  
As soon as Kraznys took Drogon she said, "that dragon is gonna burn him alive." lol.  She still screamed when it happened though.  Rewinded it about five times (ten times with Jaime's hand, lol, oh and Renly's death too).  Obviously, she thought Dany's scene was awesome and "showed her power."
2304	Valonqar_	2013-04-26	One of my friends is sure that Balon is the one holding Theon alive and that Boy is just one of his pieces. 
He thinks the BwB may be two-faced and up to something evil.
Oh and he said. One day Jon will face Robb and tell him: "I may be the bastard, but my girl(Ygritte) is hotter than yours" I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. I've already told him that he cannot stop watching the series after may 26th.
2305	wolverine	2013-04-26	They love Arya, confused by all the characters.
2306	King Kev.	2013-04-26	My mother is quite good at predicting events, despite the fact she's never even read a word of the books. Like for example, in last week's episode "Walk of Punishment", as soon as Jaime got laid down on the table, she called it. "He's going to lose his hand, and he's going to be worth nothing, thus begins character redemption arc." But for this episode, her predictions fell flat. She said Daenerys wasn't going to go through with selling her dragons, but she definitely couldn't have predicted Dany wrecking shop like that.
She also had a misfire prediction about the Night's Watch. She had told me that Jeor would eventually give into his other Night's Watchmen and take out Craster and they would free the women. Prolly not.
She's predicted that the Hound will win the fight and take Gendry and Arya along with him to Riverrun. She thinks the "Boy" is working for Balon and all this punishment is for his acts at Winterfell. Jon Snow will also apparently be sitting on the Iron Throne at the end, hahah.
2307	shiola	2013-04-26	My brother is all caught up now so I am excited to see his predictions week to week.Every time Jorah is on screen, he says "Pleaaaase say khaleesi this scene, Jorah."  He is as infatuated with Iain Glen's voice as I am with Iain Glen's everything.ETA, I found this on youtube and now he thinks I am a god. http://www.youtube.c...h?v=yca1HbizssY /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' /> He got chills for the first time since Ned's beheading during dracarys.He was sad Old Bear died because he really liked him.He believes Marg is going to screw Dany over very, very hard.He loved Varys' lines: "I choose my friends carefully, and my enemies even more carefully" and "He would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes" (paraphrasing on that first one)He thinks Pod the Stud is definitely some sort of plot point, not a running joke, because he doesn't understand why it's in to episodes otherwise.He loved that Arya spoke up in the cave even though he is afraid that if the Hound lives, Arya is in for it.

Can't forget though - the Night's Watch are comprised of a bunch of criminals. Under extreme stress is it really that surprising that they fall apart?She thinks Theon has already redeemed himself basically.  Not so much for Jaime.  She thinks he deserved it.  When I mentioned the deaths Theon caused she said he was just "crazy in the head" at the time.  Funny how she holds Theon and Jaime to much different standardsSo far in the show, it's only really Theon who has expressed regret for his actions. So I can understand that.

I explained the NW thing to her more carefully, but she still thought it was too random.  She looveeddd this episode though.  I think most people did.

When I told her what happened in the books she said that made a lot more sense and wishes they did it that way (would have been difficult). I've seen this complaint a couple of times with people saying that the mutiny should have been less spontaneous and I'm a tad confused. Unless I'm missing something it's just as spontaneous in the books. Chett's mutiny doesn't follow through and the one at Craster's is just a spare of the moment thing. The two are only linked in that the first shows the discontent within the NW to set up the second, but I think that this episode and last did a good enough job of setting that up.
2312	AdiTarg	2013-04-27	In the books we get that there's resentment in the ranks, the men aren't happy on the fist. So we are prepared more for it, plus there's a lot more details of death and wounded of the NW, and how hungry they are and depressed.
In the show it's really a scene of pig shit, and mutiny the next.

2315	teemo	2013-04-27	My boyfriend hates the show but really liked the mutiny scene...my girlfriends think it was "stupid" and "random." /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />  go figure.
2316	King Tommen	2013-04-27	I thought they set up Rast's actions earlier in the episode when he told Grenn and Edd that following Mormont had got them slaughtered at the Fist and that they should be going back to the Wall ASAP, not hanging around at Craster's.  He also specifically said that they need to worry about themselves now or else they'd all die.  Rast has been continually browbeaten by Mormont going back to S1 and more recently in getting dressed down in front of everyone on the march to Craster's and being made responsible for Sam.
So it shouldn't have been a shock that when given the opportunity, he'd backstab Mormont.  The book scene where Mormont got stabbed (by a NW character that had not even really been mentioned previously) was just as chaotic and random.  That's why the line in the book was "and then all Hell broke loose".
2317	Targaryen loyalist	2013-04-27	My GF is a non-reader. Well she is completely clueless on who "Boy" might be (she hasn't caught the Flayed Man analogy).
She is also very sympathetic towards Arya, Dany and Robb.
She considers Jon Snow a little dumb. Totally hates Joffrey and Jaimie. Loves Tyrion, Tywin and Brienne. Considers Stannis useless and without a purpose in the show. She doesn't dislike Cersei much because she says that Cersei is only protecting her children. She considers Cat also a bit stupid.
She is convinced that after "dracarys" Dany is almost on the road to Westeros ready to burn Joffrey... /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
And she is TOTALLY not expecting the Red Wedding... I'm eager to see her face when we will watch that episode. She is also convinced that Joffrey is one of the main villains... So she is also NOT expectin the Purlple Wedding.

That's why the line in the book was "and then all Hell broke loose".Not to mention Rast is introduced as a "Raper" and pretty much a huge dickhead with his comments toward Sam and Jon. There was also some subtle line by Rast of his discontent with the old bear leading them to a bloodbath to which Grenn says Mormont couldn't have known (Setting up the division of the NW over their feelings toward the LC).

2321	Martyz	2013-04-29	A non-reader friend of mine said that the good always dies, and the bad always wins. As well as that Joffrey will probably live till the end of the series.

2322	DemonKing	2013-04-29	One of the guys at work told me in complete seriousness that he fully expects John Snow to team up with the "Snow Zombies" and Robb and head south to kick Joffery's butt.

All those things going on, and that's what she wonders /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />Her other comments:- Really confused about Theon and Ramsey. It is really hard to understand in the books too, so no surprise. I cannot tell her anything, I would ruin the Bolton treason and the RW...- Rooting for Dany big time, she says is the only 'good' character in the show- Not feeling any sorry for Jamie, at least yet (interesting...)- Dying to see Joffrey dead (we are going to enjoy the PW)- Not really caring for Robb and Cat (I think the RW is a bigger shock in the books than in the show, Robb portrait on TV is not really so compelling...)- Laughing with Pod, Tyrion and Bronn- Loving Olenna Tyrell, suspicious about Marg, big pity for Sansa- Confused about the NW fight at Craster's Keep, but loving Sam- A little lost with Bran's arc (quick and strange dream scene)
2324	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-24	I think I've worked out Littlefinger's ploy. You see, it never made any sense him suggesting that he take Sansa to the Eyrie straight away because how would he get away with it? The second Sansa disappears, everyone will wonder who could have done it and Tywin most certainly would realise that it's Littlefinger.
Instead, I think Littlefinger suspects he has a spy in his midst (Ros) and is trying to rat her out. Consequently, he leaves a false trail of immediate plans to take Sansa with him to the Eyrie and uses this as bait for Ros. This would not only make Littlefinger appear like a dangerous player of the game but it also reconciles his unusually cavalier approach of late.
If my theory is right, this is bad news for poor old Ros - because Littlefinger is already many steps ahead of her.
2325	tito5601	2013-04-26	never really thought about it but yea littlefinger is smart and he would do that
2326	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-26	I think Ros is gonna end up dead soon enough, perhaps she'll even replace Dontos.
2327	Mulled Wino	2013-04-26	Its a stretch because its not an airtight trap.  Anyone could know about him ordering 2 featerbeds.
Whereas tyrion had 3 subjects with different variables.  When the traitor was revealed there could be no one else.
2328	Newstar	2013-04-27	Its a stretch because its not an airtight trap.  Anyone could know about him ordering 2 featerbeds.Not if he suspected Ros was the spy and provided her with a modified inventory list to see if anything came of it.I think that in addition to identifying the spy, Littlefinger's bigger endgame was in fact to engineer the Loras/Sansa match, and ultimately the Sansa/Tyrion match itself. He wanted to contrive a set of circumstances where the next time he approached Sansa to spirit her away, Sansa would be trapped in a horrible marriage and desperate for his help. By leaking news of the Loras/Sansa match to Tywin, he would also position himself as friendly, helpful, and not in any way personally interested in the girl himself. Heck, he could even drop subtle hints that Varys was the one who originally proposed the Loras/Sansa match o Olenna. It would play out a little like this:1. LF approaches Sansa in 3x01, says he has an assignment and that he "might" be able to take Sansa with him ("might" suggests he can beg off if Sansa actually expects him to follow through), having no intention of doing so.2. LF gives Ros an inventory list with two featherbeds, knowing full well that she's Varys' spy. Ros takes this information to Varys, who takes it to Olenna. Unsurprisingly, a Loras/Sansa match is arranged.3. Sansa is thrilled with the Loras/Sansa match...as Littlefinger would expect.4. LF, just about to leave, shows up supposedly to "fetch" Sansa. Sansa refuses and explains the reason. LF makes a great show of disappointment but is pleased at her refusal, as he never intended to take her with him at this stage.5. LF leaks this news to Tywin. Tywin is impressed by Littlefinger's show of loyalty/usefulness.6. Tywin orders Tyrion to marry Sansa.7. LF sails away, having cleared himself of suspicion as a possible "suitor" for Sansa, since he all but arranged her marriage to another man, and having gotten in good with Tywin. Varys is pissed.It would be pretty cool.My other thought that if he has identified Ros as a spy, he suspects that Tyrion has a secret prostitute love (but knows it's not Ros), and further wants to ingratiate himself, maybe he'll tell Tywin that Tyrion's lover is Ros, leading Tywin to make good on his threat.

2329	insertname	2013-04-27	That would be pretty cool, it would make Show LF a little less blunt than he already is.
2330	I'll pay the iron price	2013-04-27	In some ways Littlefinger is more dangerous than Gregor Clegane!
2331	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-27	As Newstar says, developing Littlefinger to be an actual mastermind would be a much better reflection of the actual books (and a lot more interesting too). 
Next episode we'll likely see Varys and Littlefinger in the throne room together, as shown in one of the critics spots. So this will hopefully be where Littlefinger informs Varys that he informed Tywin of Varys's little plot.
2332	Stannis' shadow babies	2013-04-27	I think OP may be right. LF knows that Ros is a spy and he may at least suspect Tyrion's lover is Shae (that's the reason Ros speaks to her as 'girl like us', LF may have already ordered Ros to find out about Shae).
2333	ShigellaSand	2013-04-28	Not if he suspected Ros was the spy and provided her with a modified inventory list to see if anything came of it.I think that in addition to identifying the spy, Littlefinger's bigger endgame was in fact to engineer the Loras/Sansa match, and ultimately the Sansa/Tyrion match itself.

Not just do "something" to prevent LF getting his hands on Sansa, but do this particular thing, rather than, say, arrange a little accident for Sansa (either killing her or just making her incapable of traveling), get her out of there through his secret tunnels the way he does with Tyrion later, have her married off to somebody else, etc etc. That's a pretty damn good prediction, since it seems the Varys-Olenna alliance came from nowhere.I'm skeptical. I'm sure LF had backup plans to his backup plans to his backup plans, but I don't think he reads minds.

I'm sure LF had backup plans to his backup plans to his backup plans, but I don't think he reads minds.Plans can grow organically. So we can say that initially, he wanted to investigate if Ros was a spy and also supply Varys with false information to see who he would go to with it. At this point he would have probably expected Varys to go to the Tyrells due to Varys becoming less and less close with the Lannisters and Tywin not being one for accusatory whispers. So naturally LF would have kept spies on people like Lady Olenna.As soon as one of his spies seeing Varys talk to Olenna, Littlefinger knows exactly what they're going to plan to do and the plan mentioned by Newstar can work perfectly. If things had played out differently, whilst it wouldn't give him an advantage, it wouldn't disadvantage him and so his actions are easily justified.*That said, I don't think D&D would have thought this carefully about Littlefinger. Maybe they have and they'll prove me wrong, but I imagine next episode Littlefinger might just go to Sansa and she'll blab everything, causing him to change his plans at the last minute and tell Tywin. But we'll see soon.*I just don't see Varys sending Sansa Stark to escape through the tunnels. Far too much personal risk for himself without any real reward. Varys is far too selfish a player for that. Likewise, he has no real reason to kill Sansa Stark. It's risky and unnecessary if he can just get her married off (and form a strong alliance in the process). I also don't think Varys is naturally cruel. So while it seems there were many options on the table for Varys - one option in particular was clearly the best.

2335	BorhPT	2013-04-28	I think that Ros is actually Litlefinger's spy on Varys. Why would a mastermind like LF get a girl like Ros to such an high position? Maybe it's because he's using her to feed information to Varys, so he can control the way he plays the game. Maybe, after the PW it will be Ros aiding Sansa on her escape and then, when she's no longer needed, LF kills her.
2336	ShigellaSand	2013-04-28	My point was not so much about whether Varys would do those things, as it was that LF can't be sure that he wouldn't. Given his obsession with Sansa, I just don't see him willingly jeopardizing his chances of getting his hands on her just to find out for sure if Roz was a spy. He'd be far more likely to simply "disappear" Roz, IMO. Better safe than sorry, nobody's going to pay attention to the fate of a whore, he can easily find another madam, and no risk of losing his grip on Cat's daughter who also happens to be the heiress of Winterfell and the North.

Better safe than sorry, nobody's going to pay attention to the fate of a whore, he can easily find another madam, and no risk of losing his grip on Cat's daughter who also happens to be the heiress of Winterfell and the North.I just think it would be more profitable for him to feed Ros misinformation, foil the likely plan that will stem from this information and then dispose of Ros. Littlefinger, after all, is a mastermind.And I see why he would be careful about jeopardizing his chances with Sansa, but Littlefinger is both devilishly smart and a risk taker. He likes chaotic, daring scheming - this sort of plan is right up his alleway.I think that Ros is actually Litlefinger's spy on Varys. Why would a mastermind like LF get a girl like Ros to such an high position? Maybe it's because he's using her to feed information to Varys, so he can control the way he plays the game. Maybe, after the PW it will be Ros aiding Sansa on her escape and then, when she's no longer needed, LF kills her.I might have thought that too but for the scene with Littlefinger and Ros where he threatens her extremely nastily. Don't think Ros would ever want to work as spy for a guy like that - although admittedly she could do it out of fear. That said, she did warn Shae in episode 1 about LF.

2338	Valonqar_	2013-04-28	The problem with Ros being Dontos'd is that that's what would give LF's plan away. There are some people by now who know LF wants to take Sansa with her. If he "fails" to do so now and Sansa simply disappears after the PW, it would be hard to associate both things. But, if LF's assistant, who has nothing to do with Sansa, also disappears, that would be too much of a giveaway.
2339	heathers	2013-04-28	Maybe he plans to ask ros along with him to the eeryie. It covers the tracks of 2 featherbeds. Then he makes ros bring sansa (possibly making out to ros that sansa is going elsewhere into hiding) then ros gets dontos'd and sansa poses as ros/his daughter. 
The main hole in my theory is getting sansa on the ship with ros and noone suspecting lf. Still i think ros is gonna die as she has been feeding info to varys.

Also I don't think Ros going missing is really going to tell anyone anything one way or another.
2341	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-29	So episode 5 didn't plan out exactly as I hoped (character motivations for Littlefinger still don't quite add up) but I did at least like how they made LF do something clever. And his manipulation of Sansa was also great to see (as well as his own insecurities). Not bad.
EDIT: Unfortunately LF's accent has been crap since season 2 began.

2342	Shadow on the Wall	2013-05-06	Called it! (near enough anyway)
Like what they did in the latest Littlefinger scene (E06). I've accepted now that they've turned him into an outright villain. And while I disagree with that decision, at least they made him a dangerous villain.

2343	FlipFantastic	2013-04-23	I think it is clear, the show will need to take a different approach than the books or it will lose its audience and succumb to some half hearted attempt to wrap things up once HBO pulls the plug after many viewers move on.  And i mean a drastic story changing deviation.  Would you be ok with this?
After this episode, the Dany fanclub is at an all time high in membership.  She now has dragons, a huge army, and two loyal knights after only 2.5 books/seasons (in a non reader's eyes).  She is only missing ships, and the producers should give her some in a completely different way than she attempts to acquire her own in the books.  I cant imagine the outrage that will come when by season 6 nothing has changed and she hasnt traversed over the sea.  Or the fact that by the end of book 3 we have Tyrion going to find her and by the end of book 5 he still hasnt.
We all know the first 3 books were the best, I wouldnt be shocked at all if HBO completely tore through some of the story lines and went their own direction after this season.  There is no shame in not following the source material to the letter, in my mind.  All movies and shows are their own adaptations and it is right about now that the show needs to make this decision.
I think the introduction of Dorne and the Iron Islands as major players would be a mistake.  I think introducing Aegon would be a mistake (wasnt his head 'dashed' against a wall?  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />.
TV viewers cant handle more characters and plotlines and they certainly wont stand for story lines that, literally, do not develop after books and books (seasons and seasons).  Can we really watch Ayra do her assassin training for two seasons?
It'll be a sad day if the show keeps following the books and then have it fizzle unceremoniously.
2344	Runaway Penguin	2013-04-28	It would be even more shame if the show was to abandon some pretty important plotlines (while Dorne chapters are tedious, their implications elsewhere aren't). Plus flying lizards need to grow.
2345	protar	2013-04-28	Absolutely not. The show up until S4 (the end of SOS) could easily have been made to the same degree of faithfulness as season 1. After that point the books could probably be adapted at the same degree of faithfulness as season 2 was actually adapted. The only huge hurdle is AFFC/ADWD but I think that 1 perhaps extended season would allow them to condense all of the interesting events of those books and speed into TWOW which will no doubt be very exciting.
2346	Nezzer	2013-04-28	I think what they need to do is keep the same overall storylines, but spice things up with new invented subplots. Keep Dany on Meereen, but make her struggle much harder against the slavers in their own game of thrones. Keep Quentyn Martell, but make him find more trouble on the way, some fighting maybe, just drop the whole Windblown thing and make him arrive at Meereen as an envoy. Keep Aegon, but show his interactions with the Golden Company. Keep the Iron Islands, but focus more on badassery with both Euron and Victarion kicking ass in battles. Keep Brienne's journey, but, like Quentyn, give her more obstacles on the way, with more trouble. Keep Arya's training, just focus more on the assassinations. The most boring parts would be Brienne's and Quentyn's, but those could be easily improved with some minor changes.
2347	Runaway Penguin	2013-04-28	Brienne's part... boring? Come on, wanton slaughter everywhere /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> Skirmish vs. Shagwell and co., hint at Sandor surviving (that would be a hard one to pull off...), then fighting Biter with Genrdy and being hanged in the end... Plenty of movie stuff there /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />

2349	Nezzer	2013-04-28	The only storyline I have absolutely no idea what they could do to improve it is Bran's. We can't have him appear in only two episodes in each season.
2350	Loras	2013-04-28	Absolutely not. The show up until S4 (the end of SOS) could easily have been made to the same degree of faithfulness as season 1. After that point the books could probably be adapted at the same degree of faithfulness as season 2 was actually adapted.

No thanks. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
2351	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-28	No, they have to keep with the same general plot arcs - and in that Dorne and the Iron Islands are key players. If they start deviating from the book massively come Season 5, the show will spiral rapidly out of control.
Instead, what I suggest, is that they vastly cut down on journey times. Because most of the journeys are boring. So Quentyn travelling to Dany is virtually cut, Tyrion's journeys shortened and made more interesting (but with the same result), Brienne's journey massively cut etc. Couple that with increasing character arc overlaps and the story will suddenly start to get more interesting.
But yes, D&D will have headaches galore come season 5 - the number of character arcs ramps up so much it is almost unworkable on tv. Almost.

2352	Kienn	2013-04-28	We all know the first 3 books were the bestI don't remember ever knowing that...Obviously the show WILL deviate, it already has a lot and thus is forced to deviate more over time. But, it will not go so far as to cut books 4 and 5, all that would do is skip to the ending of the series - they would be able to get 2-3 seasons more tops if Dany were to suddenly make it to Westeros. Otherwise they would have the same problem as you're saying they have now, immobile plot-lines that will push viewers away.Unless they want to just end the series at 5 seasons they will keep Dany in Meereen and the changes will be to keep her story relevant and interesting. There are already setups for several new plotlines that aren't in the books to fill time and extend the series in interesting ways (that still keep true to the spirit of the world of asoiaf).
2353	ShigellaSand	2013-04-28	I think it is clear, the show will need to take a different approach than the books or it will lose its audience and succumb to some half hearted attempt to wrap things up once HBO pulls the plug after many viewers move on.

Can we really watch Ayra do her assassin training for two seasons?It'll be a sad day if the show keeps following the books and then have it fizzle unceremoniously.I definitely think that the show will deviate from the books, and that some differences will be fairly important. I don't see this as necessarily a bad thing, since TV is a different medium than literature. However, I don't think it's going to happen the way you suggest.I believe the Iron Islands will be featured in Season 4. Not necessarily with all the characters - most likely Victarion and the Damphair would be merged into one, for example - but Balon's death will be followed by a fight for the throne, someone will be sent to find Dany, and there will be pillaging of the Reach. They already introduced Theon and Asha Yara, so there would be no sense in cutting out their future plotlines. Also, they are an easy way to "spice up" the slower pace of AFFC & ADWD.Likewise, I don't think Dorne will be left out. Some of the Sandsnakes disappearing would not surprise me - but they're probably going to leave in one or two to up the number of proactive women. And there must be some mention of what happened to Myrcella, since they based a lot of Cersei's hatred for Tyrion around that betrothal. This may or may not happen in Season 4, but Oberyn will offer the first introduction to Dorne.Aegon... too soon to tell. But yes, I'm pretty sure there will be some changes and/or additions to Dany's storyline in Meereen. They did it to Qarth, after all. They'll pack some more action scenes in there, I'm sure, perhaps centered around the whole issue of feeding the dragons. (Or maybe not, since CGI is so expensive... but I guess they could show the aftermath rather than the dragons themselves.)The traveling parts - Brienne, Tyrion, Quentyn (if he's even included) - may well be shortened down, or packed with more fighting or running into other characters. No idea what they'll do with Arya; I'd say that depends on what GRRM has told them about her future storyline.All that said, please be careful with phrases like "We all know that X is Y." That way lies board fighting. I'd suggest something more like "I think a lot of people will agree that..."

2354	Lady Sansa Stark	2013-04-28	And what would we do when Daenerys makes it to Westeros, far before she actually does in the books? They can't do that. I wouldn't mind if she wouldn't appear that much in the fifth season, so that we have time to explore the Dornish characters, and Oldtown for example. Then there's Samwell Tarly etc. Daenerys could show some meetings with her people and stuff, something with the Harpy etc, but they cannot simple make up a whole new plotline which deviates too much from the books. I mean, her new plotline in Season 2 when her dragons were gone and stuff, worked rather well, since it didn't change her overall story. Bringing her to Westeros earlier, would change her overall story, and that of everyone else. I'd rather have them focusing on other characters, than just Daenerys and her ''cool dragunz!''
Yes.
2355	I'll pay the iron price	2013-04-28	I hope they show Eurons sack of the Shield islands.
Its intresting because if GRRM doesnt get his finger out and finish the books then theres a real danger that HBO will catch up to the books and I cant imagine them sitting around waiting for the final books to be published.
2356	boojam	2013-04-28	Over at WIC see the interview - Q and A with Bryan Cogman , not long ago:http://winteriscomin...ach/#more-25821This the second time Dave and Dan have visited George in Santa Fe, Bryan was not along the last time.No , no spoilers or even hints of where GRRM is going with the story.But things are getting down to rail road-ing time. I have the feeling that with such an early greenlight from HBO about season 4, now Dave and Dan have to start blocking out season 5. As maybe known, as George has said, Dave and Dan (now I guess Bryan) know the 'rest of the story'. My guess is that the showrunners and Bryan talked about how to tackle Crows and Dragons. I also have the feeling that Dave and Dan have some ideas to structure season 5 (and 6 too!) to keep the visual narrative kicked up.As prose , I didn't find Crows and Dragons a drag, I love George's travelogues, I thought Tryion's was actually fun to read and Arya's story weird enough to keep me glued to the page. But HBO have probably pressed Dave and Dan about how many seasons? I mean you have to keep making a zillion dollars , which looks like HBO will do this year, and looks as if next year won't be shabby either. But the out years , there is story there, but it's TV and it going to take some imagination to make it click.

2357	Robb_Starkers	2013-04-28	They will draw out Dany's conquering of Slavers Bay for a good while yet I think. 
The battles at Yankai and Mereen are pretty much left to the imagination of readers with very little commentary(not a criticism). 
I can see the Series going more into the sieges and travels between cities and use this as an opportunity to develop certain characters. If this is what happens then I'm good with it.

I can see the Series going more into the sieges and travels between cities and use this as an opportunity to develop certain characters. If this is what happens then I'm good with it.Well George gives a pretty good summary of the battles of Yankai and Meereen , even if the action is 'off page'.From the looks of previews something about the battle of Yankai will show up this season, I can't figure how how elaborated it will be.My guess is , dead sure, the battle for the Wall will be big budget stuff season 4.That leaves the Battle for Meereen , HBO could pony up for putting that on screen but I am guessing not, I hope they surprise me.There is very interesting and engaging story in Crows and Dragons , some action, the fight Asha has at Deepwood Motte is not a big battle but could be fleshed out and would not be expensive.Victarion and god-knows-who else breaking the siege at Meereen could be bigger than Black Water and the Battle for the Wall put together , but we don't know what George is going to do about that.The battle for Westeros against the Others could trump everything that has happened, but lord! I will not try to out guess GRRM on that one!
2359	jmk51	2013-04-28	I've posted this before, but we still don't know how important the Iron Islands and Dorne are to the overall plot.   If the purpose of Victaron sailing to Dany is to shuttle her back that can be done many different ways. 
So far Dornes contribution has been a trial by combat and letting the other two Dragons loose. 
But....  We are about to lose several key characters over the next two seasons,  so there will be plenty of room to develop these new story lines.   
At this point,  Imo, the book story is more a soap opera than anything else.  Characters dying (some reanimated), random paths crossing,  new characters introduced,  but it doesn't seem the plot has moved forward greatly.
2360	Tyrion_the_Oneironaut	2013-04-28	When you break it down, they're going to need a lot of filler scenes involving Tyrion, Theon, Varys etc starting around episode 6 this season.
Daenerys in Mereen might also have a few surprises for book readers in season 4, and probably in season 5.
The reasons aren't really as you say, to keep the tv audience happy, but more so to keep the actors happy. Can't have an actor wait a year or two until they're written back into a tv series(ie Alphie Allen).
2361	Newstar	2013-04-28	But yes, D&D will have headaches galore come season 5 - the number of character arcs ramps up so much it is almost unworkable on tv. Almost.Yes. I have my doubts as to whether AFFC and ADWD are even filmable, either as is or "spliced" together as we expect they will be. Because if you splice them together, you have the following separate plotlines to sort through: Victarion/Dany/Quentyn/Tyrion/Sam/Sansa/Arya/Arianne/Jon/Jaime/Cersei/Brienne/Asha/Theon/Bran/everyone else. It was one thing when the characters were somewhat more centrally located, but a lot of these POVs are happening completely cut off from each other: Sansa, Arya, Bran, Arianne, etc. It seems way too hairy to boil down into a coherent narrative. Heck, critics are complaining about the fragmented storylines as it is.
2362	thenedstark	2013-04-28	I think it may depend on when Winds of Winter comes out. AFFC and ADWD are both not very telegenic, when it comes to battles and deaths. Both are more of epic fantasy soap operas which is great in its own way. If HBO is content to put out a soap opera for a couple of seasons (seasons 5 and 6), then that would work, I guess. However, if WOW comes out by then (around 2016, and we have been promised some battles in the beginning of the book), maybe those battles could help in retaining the viewership numbers for post season 5/6.
2363	JMJ	2013-04-28	A huge problem most of us readers had with Dany's storyline was Daario and to a lesser extent Hizdhar. I think if HBO simply writes them into better, more compelling characters, they will be fine. Viewers need to believe why Dany would be into these guys much more than readers were.
The show-Dany fans love Drogo. I don't see why this can't be the case with show Daario.
I'd start by losing the blue hair and gold teeth.
2364	Reposado	2013-04-28	Of course. Most obviously because the series will finish before the next book. But I've also long trumpeted the idea that danys invasion should have happened in season 2
2365	Zman1863	2013-04-28	Of course. Most obviously because the series will finish before the next book. But I've also long trumpeted the idea that danys invasion should have happened in season 2I don't think such a dramatic departure from the books was necessary that early. The show has only been increasing in popularity since it started and they had nothing to lose from a faithful adaptation. I think if they pace the rest of season three and four right, the show will be at its zenith of popularity by the time the show gets seriously into AFFC and ADWD. I  expect the series' ratings to start to decline in those next two seasons as the inevitable result of books 4 and 5 being the middle act in the series. If they can do it well the show's ratings and popularity will still be strong despite a decline.
2366	go joff go	2013-04-28	I would be surprised if the battle of mareen isn't in season 6.  George will almost certainly have written that scene even if the book isn't out.  I don't feel like they need to find A LO for Dany to do, rather that they need to figure out Quarth size subplot that is interesting that takes half a season.  I also agree with the poster that say making guys like Daario and others into better characters would go a long way.  I'm a little wary that they seemed to cast a guy who superficially seems doushey like Daario.  I would just make him a generic badass if I were the showrunners.
2367	Rashtibram	2013-04-29	I think the introduction of Dorne and the Iron Islands as major players would be a mistake.  I think introducing Aegon would be a mistake (wasnt his head 'dashed' against a wall?  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />.	 I agree that they'll need to think carefully about how they do it, but omitting big things might create bigger problems later on. We don't know how important Aegon, Dorne, and the iron islands are to the eventual conclusion. i think they should just try to liven certain things up. i mean, they could dramatize daenerys' flight on drogon a lot more. i think they have enough outlets to keep viewers faithful.
2368	Reposado	2013-04-29	I don't think such a dramatic departure from the books was necessary that early.

If they can do it well the show's ratings and popularity will still be strong despite a decline.necessary,no. but interesting and i think beneficial in a few ways. one. you delay the introduction of stannis/mel/davos until season 3. thismeans that all of their book 2 development happens in early season 3, whereas the book 3 had very little of this story line.two. you get another shocker moment when dany, who we have invested all this time in, goes down at the blackwater.three. you save an incredible amount of money by getting rid of a character who is all by herself and require her own sets, casts, etc which will now be kept up for the next three seasons.four. narrows the focus of the story.five. eliminates her awful season two plotline. eliminates the season 5 plotline we know is coming. (not there werent other ways around this. they tried and failed in s2. they could fix it in s5)six. blackwater would have been even better with someone that the majority was rooting for attacking kLbut in the end, danys early season 2 invasion, isnt something they needed to do. but its an example of the kind of plot deviations they need to think about. as opposed to the, "this is somewhat different but it gets them to the same place" type of changes that they have been doing
2369	Cruella	2013-04-29	If they did that, they might as well just pitch their own story and have an all original show. Because it would no longer resemble ASOIAF.
2370	Agamemnon	2013-04-29	I hope they dont cut Arya's storyline, in ADWD she started growing seriously badass. They are going to have to extend the series even more I think for books 4&5. Probably have to merge them and stretch it out to three seasons between them. Not sure how they would do that though....
2371	Rashtibram	2013-05-01	Absolutely not. The show up until S4 (the end of SOS) could easily have been made to the same degree of faithfulness as season 1. After that point the books could probably be adapted at the same degree of faithfulness as season 2 was actually adapted. The only huge hurdle is AFFC/ADWD but I think that 1 perhaps extended season would allow them to condense all of the interesting events of those books and speed into TWOW which will no doubt be very exciting.I think they're facing a huge dilemma right now. Seasons 3 and 4 being adapted from by far the best book in the series, I think it's highly possible that these two seasons will be the peak of the show's success. They must realize that, having just been confronted by a myriad of game-changing deaths and breathtaking moments (Red Wedding, Purple Wedding, Tyrion's trial and the anxiety that his show fanboys will be feeling, Tywin's death on the privy, the Battle of Castle Black and Stannis to the rescue), people, after enjoying a few episodes of relapse from the wildness of those two seasons, will expect the show to continue in the same degree of climactic occurrences, and will become increasingly frustrated if they are met with the kind of meandering, pointless story lines we book-readers had to endure in the fourth and fifth books. A decrease in popularity is pretty much inevitable if they are to retain any degree of faithfulness to GRRM's work. With that in mind, the logical solution would be, as you have pointed out, to condense all the meanderings of the fourth and fifth books into 1 or 2 seasons, emphasizing the more dramatic moments (Dany's flight on Drogon, Jon's assassination, Brienne killing the "Hound" at the inn with Gendry etc.) and glossing over the more pointless and tedious ones. Indeed, I think this is what they really should do. But the problem with this is that if they do that, they will finish the available books in two more seasons and will be left with two or three years before 'Winds of Winter' even comes out.

2372	siknes	2013-05-04	I would be surprised if the battle of mareen isn't in season 6.  George will almost certainly have written that scene even if the book isn't out.  I don't feel like they need to find A LO for Dany to do, rather that they need to figure out Quarth size subplot that is interesting that takes half a season.  I also agree with the poster that say making guys like Daario and others into better characters would go a long way.  I'm a little wary that they seemed to cast a guy who superficially seems doushey like Daario.  I would just make him a generic badass if I were the showrunners.I always picture Daario somewhat like the guy that played Jaqen.  It seems that he is not liked because he is so cocky and he really doesn't give a shit about Dany, he just wants to F her and be by her side.  The pedophile aspect of some of the storylines aside, Mormont at least does love her and she him(just not the lustful teenage love that she thinks she wants) and he would die to save her, where as Daario would be 2nd Sons were out of here.  I don't think his character matters, he was probably one of the bodies being thrown over the wall. His character has to die, paralleling Yggrite, they just get in the way as far as where Jon and Dany ultimately have to go. He knows she doesn't have a damn clue, which is why she needs Tyrion.
2373	siknes	2013-05-04	I think they're facing a huge dilemma right now. Seasons 3 and 4 being adapted from by far the best book in the series, I think it's highly possible that these two seasons will be the peak of the show's success. They must realize that, having just been confronted by a myriad of game-changing deaths and breathtaking moments (Red Wedding, Purple Wedding, Tyrion's trial and the anxiety that his show fanboys will be feeling, Tywin's death on the privy, the Battle of Castle Black and Stannis to the rescue), people, after enjoying a few episodes of relapse from the wildness of those two seasons, will expect the show to continue in the same degree of climactic occurrences, and will become increasingly frustrated if they are met with the kind of meandering, pointless story lines we book-readers had to endure in the fourth and fifth books. A decrease in popularity is pretty much inevitable if they are to retain any degree of faithfulness to GRRM's work. With that in mind, the logical solution would be, as you have pointed out, to condense all the meanderings of the fourth and fifth books into 1 or 2 seasons, emphasizing the more dramatic moments (Dany's flight on Drogon, Jon's assassination, Brienne killing the "Hound" at the inn with Gendry etc.) and glossing over the more pointless and tedious ones. Indeed, I think this is what they really should do. But the problem with this is that if they do that, they will finish the available books in two more seasons and will be left with two or three years before 'Winds of Winter' even comes out. With such a big gap, it's logical to assume that many viewers will grow impatient with waiting for a show which seems unlikely ever to return. So here they are (the producers) with very little material for exciting TV and way too much time to do it. Somebody should glue GRRM to his computer /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />.Brienne killing the Hound? Did you really read?
2374	siknes	2013-05-04	necessary,no. but interesting and i think beneficial in a few ways. one. you delay the introduction of stannis/mel/davos until season 3. thismeans that all of their book 2 development happens in early season 3, whereas the book 3 had very little of this story line.two. you get another shocker moment when dany, who we have invested all this time in, goes down at the blackwater.three. you save an incredible amount of money by getting rid of a character who is all by herself and require her own sets, casts, etc which will now be kept up for the next three seasons.four. narrows the focus of the story.five. eliminates her awful season two plotline. eliminates the season 5 plotline we know is coming. (not there werent other ways around this. they tried and failed in s2. they could fix it in s5)six. blackwater would have been even better with someone that the majority was rooting for attacking kLbut in the end, danys early season 2 invasion, isnt something they needed to do. but its an example of the kind of plot deviations they need to think about. as opposed to the, "this is somewhat different but it gets them to the same place" type of changes that they have been doingYou type things just trying to be ignorant, and get knee jerk reactions.
2375	Rashtibram	2013-05-05	Brienne killing the Hound? Did you really read?The 'Hound'. as in, Rorge, not Sandor. i don't remember if she's the one who actually kills him because that part of her story was very surreal, but it's pretty irrelevant. the point is, if they do the show chronologically (as opposed to geographically, as in the books) they still have some very dramatic, exciting moments to keep viewers hooked even if the actual story hardly advances significantly. For instance, the attack by the stone men on the river would make a good season finale for season 5, (could be called 'Rivers' which would also refer to jaime breaking riverrun), and dany's flight would make a good climax to a 4th or 5th episode of season 6; Jon's assassination could be a ninth episode to season 6 called something like 'For the Watch' or 'Daggers in the Dark'; Bran flashing through his childhood in the godswood with the Children would be an emotional moment for episode 7 or 8 of season 5, and so on. If they do it right and dramatize the right moments, it could have just as much popularity as the first 3 seasons. (my point then was that if they do that, they'll end up with a two year gap before they can start making season 7, so a popularity drop one way or the other is almost inevitable.)

Huge changes will make book readers mad and will lose the close association with GRRM's work which is really essential to this show.
2377	boojam	2013-05-05	The reasons aren't really as you say, to keep the tv audience happy, but more so to keep the actors happy. Can't have an actor wait a year or two until they're written back into a tv series(ie Alphie Allen).No, Dave and Dan have to keep the money people happy, HBO.

... of which I'm not a believer, but I still think it's interesting, I'm keeping an eye out for Talisa or anything related.
Anyway, Tywin was writing a word when the camera zoomed in on him and it just caught my eye. Did that word look like 'Talisa' to you? It kind of did to me.
2379	Flayed Starkman	2013-04-22	Roose change, eh. I like the pun.

2381	SerArthurHeath	2013-04-22	Talissa does remind me a little of Jules in One Tree Hill back in the old days. I wonder if there is a trope name for that thing where a girl is paid to make her employer's enemy fall for them but then part way through the process falls in love with them?
2382	Kasrith	2013-04-22	Agreed. I too pay attention when I see him writing letters, but there is no way he used her name
2383	SerArthurHeath	2013-04-22	I really hope she is a spy though, would be a nice twist and I'd never seriously considered it but that video makes a decent case

The writers are not so clueless as to leave that out, but it's not something most viewers would pick up on.I don't want her to be a spy.  I think that'd be stupid.  Roose is the only one in Robb's trust who needs to work against him.  Two would be too many.

2401	Ramsay Gimp	2013-04-22	If she's a spy or a plant, I would only like it if she really does fall in love with Robb and ends up choosing him over her original allegiance. Otherwise it's just an insane amount of betrayal
2402	mediterraneo	2013-04-22	I found it significant that Tywinn was using the present: "I'm doing everything in my power to free my son", paraphrase.
During the scene he is talking to Cersei of important State businness, all of which have to wait, not only because the show wants us to see how Tywinn is  not happpy with his sons and make them feel like children, but because he was actually doing something more important than talking with Cersei.
He started a war for freeing his little son, he was going to try to end the same war to free his bigger one.
So I feel it was no casual e-mail he was writing, but something very important for the status of Jaime AND the course of the war.
Or so I interpreted the scene.

2406	MarieAntoinette	2013-04-23	Spoiler  I don't want Talisa to be a spy. I disliked the Talisa character from the beginning on, but this would be so over the top. I think at this point it is far more believable that she is a woman who fell in love with Robb than some spy for Tywin. What would be her motiviation? I'm fine with Roose working against Robb they don't need a second person for that.
2407	Dove	2013-04-23	Spoilers, seriously don't look if you haven't finished the books:
	Spoiler The only reason I like the idea of Talisa being a spy is to give LS a more meaningful first kill than a couple of random less-than-background characters, because if she is then I'm fairly sure that's what her character would be ultimately used for. But yeah, it would seem really contrived that the ~field medic spy~ just happens to get Robb to fall in love with her and etc.
2408	Jon Sn0w	2013-04-23	here's a thought.  Maybe she was sent as a spy to get him to fall in love with her and or to just have him have sex with her to have his child!!  in turn if she got pregnant and he was killed she would have the next right full heir to the north and be in the hands of the lannisters...

	Spoiler But it is easier to marry a Lannister directly to Sansa or Arya. The child would be the future lord of Winterfell and would be a Lannister in blood as same as name!
2410	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-23	I sincerely hope she doesn't end up being a spy. That would be so over the top.While the video is put together really well, I don't think she is because:1.

Either way, she's a terrible character.

2423	Iotun	2013-04-23	I'm not buying it. For example the Talisa scene with the two Lannisters portraying Talisa as the cutesy nice nurse, doesn't strike me as something that would play exactly that way if this theory was true. Also, perhaps not the best justification, but I'm just not reading that in any of the Oona Chapliin interviews.
Also
	Spoiler  If she's a spy, why would she go to the Twins with Robb? If Lord Frey doesn't know that she's a spy, she would expect to get killed, and if Lord Frey DOES know that she's a spy it makes not sense for him to ally with Tywin knowing that Tywin deliberately send somebody to make the king break his vows to House Frey, thus insulting his house and family.

2434	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-23	Robb's in the middle of an army of nearly 20,000 men, with all sorts of retainers, a betrothal to a Frey, etc..  The odds on this one woman somehow managing to so wonderfully seduce him that he ends of breaking that vow is so incredibly unlikely that I can't imagine it was part of a plot.  She's decent looking, but she's not presented as especially attractive on the level you'd expect to induce the breaking of vows.

Her meeting the Lannister boys being held prisoner in ep 3 conforms that, they have no idea who she is.Yeah, but not really. She would be a terrible spy if any one carrying the Lannister name knew who she was.I really like this theory. It makes a lot of sense.It is hard to believe that writers would give such a subtle plot line in the show though.I'm an avid reader/watcher of GoT to include lore, this never occured to me.Why I love fans, catching all those details.
2443	Vifee	2013-04-24	This is a very interesting idea, since we're missing the whole Jeyne Westerling thing..Well she was reluctant to go to the Crag, which was Jeyne Westerling's home.  In fact, she was originally cast as Jeyne Westerling. Maybe the thing that's off about her is that she really is Jeyne, but in the show she decides to hide her identity.  Jeyne in the books was skilled enough as a healer to be permitted to attend to Robb, the two characters are quite similar.

2448	Rhasgul	2013-04-22	To start off I'd like to state that just like pretty much everyone else, I loved the scene.
I had chills running down my spine when she started speaking High Valyrian and I went crazy when the time for Dracarys came. I loved the way Emilia acted and how her Valyrian was close to perfection. 
I want to state though, that I really didn't like the fact that Kraznys just stood there after receiving the dragon.
Obviously, it's cool right? You get one of the first dragons hatched in ages? But he just stands there, watching the dragon, for such a long time... Dany has time for her whole "zen moment" and ordering the Unsullied to march and such while he just stands there.
Now don't get me wrong. I know there are arguments like; "He just got a dragon, he's shocked." and "He made a businessdeal so it's normal to wait for a while." or something.
The other part of me though, feels like he KNEW that the dragon would be very wild and possibly angry for having to leave it's mother. I think the actual Kraznys would first of all lock the dragon in a cage (suppose he lost his grip and the dragon flew away?) and he would also leave the scene of trade pretty quickly. It's made clear how he has no respect whatsoever for Dany so once the deal is done he wants nothing else from her. I just don't think he would stand there, still and silent, waiting for something to happen.
It's just something that bugged me while watching it and I was wondering if there was anyone else with the same feeling.
2449	Effie	2013-04-22	I think it was a very arrogant move not to have a cage ready and I think he had the delusions of taming a dragon just like he 'tamed' the unsullied. And I think it was a very wondrous moment for him, too. Sort of thinking "Ah, it'd be cool to have a dragon, I'll be almighty" and then realizing "Oh wait, I have a dragon, an actual dragon, hold on, what now?" 
And of course halfway through Dany's big moment we can see how he is struggling because he can't control the dragon. 
This is a bit silly, but I felt like he expected a Harry Potter moment. You know when Potter first held the wand in the wand shop and lights started flickering and there was a wind machine involved and oh the magic. I think Kraznys expected something like that, a magical moment that shows how powerful he is, because it is a dragon after all. So I felt he acted like a person who is stupid and power-hungry and arrogant and at the same time too stunned to realize what is going on around him and I think that's pretty much the character.
2450	Greywolf2375	2013-04-22	I think it worked out pretty much as I'd expected - he completely disregards Dany, so in his opinion anything that she has under control obviously he would be able to control
On top of that he holds the symbolic whip of the Unsullied, he receives the chain for the dragons so he should be the rightful master - that's how his thought process is working.  Not that this is a potentially intelligent, loyal creature to Dany.  He sees it as property, she sees it as a child.

Even holding on to it.

2453	Versiroth	2013-04-22	Well, he just saw Danny calmly walk over to him holding the handle/chain like it was nothing.   He was likely first in amazement, followed by frustration that the Dragon was struggling so much.    It's not like he was just standing there.   He was struggling with Drogon from the start and eventually told the girl to tell Danny that the Dragon was struggling.
2454	Iotun	2013-04-22	Eh, I thought it was normal. I thought from his perspective, the way it should play out is, I get the dragon, she gets the whip, I wait for a bit, business like and keeping up the respectful pretences until she leaves or at least starts leaving while I hold the dragon, then hand the chain to a slave or put the dragon in a cage and go from there. If you're Kraznys, and you've just finished what is probably the biggest deal in your lifetime, would you just go, 'Ok, here's the whip, bye now', turn around and leave? I think it was a business like 'I will stay here until the customer has left'. It didn't hurt that the entire city was watching him as well.
2455	shiola	2013-04-22	Dragons are fucking strong.  He tried to reel it in towards him but couldn't.
2456	TheDeadWolf	2013-04-22	Also, not to nitpick but I thought the Valyrian  reveal was kinda bad in terms of dialogue.  "You speak Valyrian?"  I know it's hard to be subtle because they don't want it to go over peoples' heads but I thought that line was badly written.
2457	AliKat	2013-04-22	Dragons are fucking strong.  He tried to reel it in towards him but couldn't.Yeah - he was still standing there because he couldn't get Drogon to behave. And why would he bring a cage for him? He had Dany's cage. She wouldn't need it anymore after giving away the dragon so he could take it. But mainly he was unable to get Drogon to follow his command and had no control.This whole scene was badass. I watched it about 5 times. The look on Jorah's and Missandei's faces when Dany started talking to the Unsullied in Valaryian was awesome. Missandei was like 'wait, what? Oh nooo, you guys are in trouble now!' and Jorah was completely stunned that she had a plot that she didn't tell him about and I think he was most likely turned out by his bad ass dragon queen. lol
2458	darksellsword	2013-04-22	I thought how he reacted was plausible. He hadnt seen the dragons he negotiated for 1 dragon the biggest but maybe
the reality of actually holding the chain of a dragon was over whelming. He had no reason to believe Dany had designs
on killing him and the slave masters, for him slavery is a necessary part of life. He asks messandei to tell Daenerys
that her dragon will not come to him, i think that he assumed that Dany only had control over Drogon because of
the chain through training, as for Dany speaking Valyrian and he ignores it, well perhaps when she was commanding
the army to move forward and halt he was thinking messandei had shown her the commands. thats why i thought
the look on Messandeis face was priceless , she was the only one in the moment that realised the implications.
Kraznys faith was sealed the moment he handed the whip to Dany and explained its significance. While she
was commanding the unsullied to kill and the masters with whips, soliders and to spare any child and to break the chains
of any slave The sheer size of Daenerys new army stunned any solider that would defend Krazny, they knew that the
unsullied were hers now.
2459	Woel	2013-04-22	Also, not to nitpick but I thought the Valyrian  reveal was kinda bad in terms of dialogue.  "You speak Valyrian?"  I know it's hard to be subtle because they don't want it to go over peoples' heads but I thought that line was badly written.That was one line, from a not especially eloquent person in moment of surprise. DId you expect "O, Whore of Westeros, speakest thou Valyrian? Quelle surprise!". Your nitpicking is invalid.Edit: Also, what #4 and #7 said regarding Kraznys. In my mind, it felt natural.

I know it's hard to be subtle because they don't want it to go over peoples' heads but I thought that line was badly written.Yeah, it was pretty terrible. Though it her response more than made up for it -- Valyrian sounds awesome.
2462	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-22	Well I think it was a combo of "i got a real live dragon" and that Drogon was putting up a struggle. he definately wasn't paying attention as he didn't get that she was talking valaryn until she addressed him.
2463	Capt Banjo	2013-04-22	There are always moments in TV (not just this show) where people have to kind of stand by and wait for a moment or a line and it may not always seem like the most natural thing to do. In this case, Dany speak old dialect to the Unsullied while he is preoccupied with Drogon, then he slips out another "bitch" and she drops the very scarily delivered, "A dragon is not a slave" line. It was about the "BANG" moment. He could've walked off or put Drogon in a cage, but it seemed like Dany had this idea anyway. He would've just taken a spear instead of getting Dracarys'd.

I guess he couldn't get it to come down or move or anything, so he just hung out there on the platform and kept trying.
2465	The Ghost of Winter	2013-04-24	I wasn't a big fan of the Micheal Bay type effects with a giant wall of flames erupting behind Daenerys' head.
2466	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2013-04-24	I wasn't a big fan of the Micheal Bay type effects with a giant wall of flames erupting behind Daenerys' head.It would have worked better if it was clear that the dragon was clearing the wall of guards.

Dave and Dan had Dan Hildebrand play him as a little more wily while still being a total jerk.I think that GRRM and D and D played it that way for dramatic license.You think the slavers would of thought it through and had a cage of their own, but greedy people do stupid things , so it was not unusual.Besides no one in Astapor had seen a dragon for , what?, maybe 100's if not a 1000 years.I wouldn't know how a dragon would behave!In fact just what was Kraznys going to do with Drogon? Even Dany does not know how to train them to be war dragons, yet.I would have sold Drogon , jez, must be someone in Essos with enough gold to buy him.
2470	boojam	2013-04-24	Yeah, it was pretty terrible. Though it her response more than made up for it -- Valyrian sounds awesome.That makes no sense, I don't know what you guys are talking about?The whole impact of that line was to show the slavers had stupidly , and totally, missed that Dany had a strategy.She understood everything they said, and she was going to rub it in.It was perfect.

Not that this is a potentially intelligent, loyal creature to Dany.  He sees it as property, she sees it as a child.I agree.  Kraznys is accustomed to being in control.  And this is the equivalent of him receiving the keys to Fort Knox.
2472	The Ghost of Winter	2013-04-24	The first time I watched, I honestly thought the dragon was searing the slaves crucified along the walk of punishment to death.That's exactly what I thought too. Lol. "Why did you burn the poor slaves Drogon? Not cool"
2473	boojam	2013-04-24	It would have worked better if it was clear that the dragon was clearing the wall of guards.Yes when I first watched that scene I thought "what about the guards" on the wall?"Now they were armed with only spears , not bows.So I thought when all hell broke loose it was Run Away, Run Away time.After a couple of viewings it seems that was what was implied , it was Drogon clearing the wall of guards... (By the by how did he know to do that? Dany warging him?)In the book all three dragons take part in the mayhem , but I guess was not in the VFX budget.Tho we did get all three in the final sequence.We have only seen Drogon twice up close, Viserion and Rhaegal are only seen in the distance.Again! Why the heck have they not gotten their names by now?
2474	crazibouncer	2013-04-24	I don't think him standing there was weird.  He just got a dragon, and it kind of seemed like he had a problem moving it.  Drogon was tugging away from him and they are getting pretty big, it would be tough to just walk away with him.  Can't put him in a cage if he is 20 feet in the air and you do not want to piss off a dragon.  He also thought Dany was some stupid slut anyway, he never would have thought about it.  In the book there are several Astapori traders, Kraznyz one of them.  As there stare at Drogon only one of the traders notices that Dany is speaking Valyrian during her Unsullied speech.  It is too late for them to do anything.
2475	DemiNymph	2013-04-24	This whole scene was done badly for me. It wasn't dramatic enough, the screenplay was just bad and unimaginative. It felt under budget but I guessed the dragons and CGI unsullied army ala LOTR orcs took a lot of money. It didn't give me the high I got when reading the books. Quite rushed, not enough build up. Disappointing. But my non-reader husband was ok with it, he kept saying comon, sack THIS city first. So he was satisfied when it happened. It didn't give him a high thou. I just want everybody to experience the high I got when reading this scene.
2476	Delmas	2013-04-24	The ONLY, ONLY thing about this scene I thought was strange is why do these fools put guards on walls with axes and not bows?  /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' />

2480	Lady Shadow Cat	2013-04-24	Dracarys SceneIf you go to about 2:04, behind Dany you can see Drogon struggling to follow her. Karaznys was struggling the whole time to try and get Drogon under control and wasn't able to do much else. Imagine trying to control a large-medium muscular dog. Now give it wings.

His lust for power and lack of respect for her blinded him from the fact that he's in over his head. When he says "The bitch has her army" he doesn't even realise that he's fucked.because he's too concerned with this dragon he has never seen before in his life. He sees power before him ,basically in his grasp and can't control it . His expressions in the scene clearly shows this especially when he takes the chain from her.  However, when she says " A dragon is not a slave" thats when he realises he's FUCKED.

2489	Runaway Penguin	2013-04-25	The scene was well written and exactly showed the slave master's complacency. Add to that the distressed cries of Drogon when he was chained and given to a stranger... Very emotional scene.
Kraznys was unable to go anywhere, Drogon won't come. He was preoccupied by the struggling lizard and ignored "the bitch from westeros"... Until it was too late.
2490	lannistergold	2013-04-25	The fact that the guy was prepared to sell his entire army says enough. He was suicidally overconfident, and/or didn't think that Dany had it in her to command an army. His ignorance about dragon behaviour was the most excusable error of his.
2491	Runaway Penguin	2013-04-25	He didn't care about Dany being able to command or not, he was just too wrapped up in his game to realise that someone might want to smash the board.
Happens in real life as well. WWII is good example, Stalin was so wrapped up in his plans he didn't realise that Hitler's next target is USSR and ignored warnings; Allies initially uderestimated Germany and Germans, for the most part, underestimated the power of Britain and USA - because in both cases, part of the power came from smashing the board and playing a new game.
2492	Rhaenys Sand	2013-04-25	I think it was a very arrogant move not to have a cage ready and I think he had the delusions of taming a dragon just like he 'tamed' the unsullied. And I think it was a very wondrous moment for him, too. Sort of thinking "Ah, it'd be cool to have a dragon, I'll be almighty" and then realizing "Oh wait, I have a dragon, an actual dragon, hold on, what now?"And of course halfway through Dany's big moment we can see how he is struggling because he can't control the dragon.This is a bit silly, but I felt like he expected a Harry Potter moment. You know when Potter first held the wand in the wand shop and lights started flickering and there was a wind machine involved and oh the magic. I think Kraznys expected something like that, a magical moment that shows how powerful he is, because it is a dragon after all. So I felt he acted like a person who is stupid and power-hungry and arrogant and at the same time too stunned to realize what is going on around him and I think that's pretty much the character. /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />
2493	Miodrag	2013-04-25	What bothered me most was the fact that, of all those dozens (hundreds? thousands? canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t tell whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s CGI, and whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a real person in front of the camera) of people participating in the scene, only two and a half were actually acting: Emilia, Kraznys and, to a certain extent, Jorah Mormont (he did bring on his disturbed/worried face at the beginning, and later nodded with his head few times). Everyone else, Selmy included, looked like theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re just standing there and waiting for the shooting to end. I mean, Selmy did absolutely nothing besides pulling his sword out at one moment.
Actors and stunts are hardly the ones to take the blame for this. As it seems, they simply werenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t told to do anything, which is a pity. Wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t it be exciting, cinematic, dramatic, if some of the slavemastersâ<U+0080><U+0099> guards tried to attack Danaerys, only to be denied by Barristan, or Jorah, or both?

There was, however, too much clumsiness in the Unsullied charge at the slavemasters.
2494	Tone	2013-04-25	Also would have liked to see more of the massacre but understand they are prob saving the budget for the battle at the Wall.
Emilia nailing Valyrian totally was the highlight of this scene for me. I was so excited to see how they were going to do this scene, being one of my favorite moments in the books.
2495	Runaway Penguin	2013-04-25	Well, everyone standing around until the time came was kinda point of the entire scene. Both Selmy and Mormont do react to the defelopment, on the other hand Selmy does it more subtly - after all he is the one cautious about Dany /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
2496	BlueDragon	2013-04-25	What bothered me most was the fact that, of all those dozens (hundreds? thousands? canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t tell whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s CGI, and whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a real person in front of the camera) of people participating in the scene, only two and a half were actually acting: Emilia, Kraznys and, to a certain extent, Jorah Mormont (he did bring on his disturbed/worried face at the beginning, and later nodded with his head few times). Everyone else, Selmy included, looked like theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re just standing there and waiting for the shooting to end. I mean, Selmy did absolutely nothing besides pulling his sword out at one moment.Actors and stunts are hardly the ones to take the blame for this. As it seems, they simply werenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t told to do anything, which is a pity. Wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t it be exciting, cinematic, dramatic, if some of the slavemastersâ<U+0080><U+0099> guards tried to attack Danaerys, only to be denied by Barristan, or Jorah, or both? Wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t it be better than seeing the surreal site of Danaerys just standing there while something burns/explodes behind her?All in all, it wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t such a bad scene.

There was, however, too much clumsiness in the Unsullied charge at the slavemasters.There are bugetary limits to what they can do.  I don't think it makes sense for those of us who don't know what things cost or what the budget is to claim they should do this or that.  It is just a waste of time to even think like that. I completely disagree about Jorah and Selmy taking an active part.  Watching the guys fail around with their sabres is totally besides the point: after a dragon queen has just won a tremendous victory and lost nothing on her side. The point of what is happening is that Dany is in total control and that she doesn't even need her help at the moment because she has so  timed her moves precisely which is one reason why Jorah and Selmy could not know.  She did not want their body language to send out a tense signal.  Instead, they are standing there stupified that she is actually going through with the trade.  They are crestfallen; it shows ad that is a good thin. And had they been twirling around there would have been that perfect moment when they look at each other in wonder and both know that they are serving the most badass  Targareyn evah!!!!!  The unsullied's intuition about her adds to the power.  I could care less if Jorah went toe to toe with a slaver's lieutenant.

There was, however, too much clumsiness in the Unsullied charge at the slavemasters.You know that scene is only about 10 (it could be 12 min.) long and when , on a show like this one has to jam twice as much action into half as much time in fewer takes than one can do with a big budget film (I know HBO spends a lot on each episode but 6 or 7 mil only goes so far) then economies have to made.By the by even tho you can see them in the back as Drogon is brought in , in that cage, her Dothraki bloodrides (well two of them) were nearer her than Barristan, or Jorah , alas they were 'off-camera' when all the action when down. In the book there are her three canonical bloodriders , in fact I think other Dothraki warriors too.I heard they had 1000 extras to play Unsullied, which is a lot these days, and VFX-ing that many to be 8000 is just a matter of money.I think only about 100 of the extras were trained to do 'stunt' work. I don't think a single one of them was a trained actor. I don't even know if the actor who plays Grey Worm was in the crowd.Did seem the spear and sword action was abbreviated , but that was a timing and budget problem, at least it did not look like that silly movie 300 with god awful comic book action sequences.By the by did anyone notice that when they rode out of Astapor that back there in the back were at least three (or maybe more) Dothraki bloodriders? Long time since we have seen them.

2498	bobbybuilderton	2013-04-28	I don't know what needs to happen for my boyfriend to be impressed by this show.  He's already forgotten this scene and only remembers the mutiny at Craster's Keep.I think he'll be impressed come episode 9. But really though, it's all a matter of taste I guess.I just wanted to comment on Dany's choice here because I didn't want to make a new thread...but I can't wait for the non-readers to see the fallout of her actions. I feel like a lot of people are in the same place as a lot of book readers were after this scene, which is feeling that she is ready to head to Westeros and kick some ass. But of course, this is somewhat close to real life and taking down a slave trade is actually kind of a big deal. I've seen so many fans of the show saying "Aw yeah, Joffrey better watch out!" and "Dany's ready to get to Westeros now and take the throne! Can't wait to see who she'll team up with" and it's just really amusing for me because even when reading the book, I had a bad feeling about it. Yes, it was an awesome scene but when you're in the moment you don't realize the gravity of what she's just started. It's great and noble and everything to want to free slaves but she just waltzes in and tries to "fight the power" single-handedly. It's like she thinks she's a god just because she has dragons and there will be no repercussions. She doesn't think of the fact that sometimes people who are freed don't want to be because it's all they know. She doesn't think of the fact that hitting someone's wallet has always been the surest way to piss them off, next to insulting their religious beliefs. Basically, it was immature even if it came from a place of kindness. And because it comes from a place of kindness and Kraznys was so horrible, we're totally on her side...until we realize that it's not as simple as "this is wrong and I will stop it."Can't wait to see their reactions.

Yeah maybe Lincoln shouldn't have tried to emancipate the slaves because it led to one of the bloodiest conflicts the US has ever seen on American soil and ruined the Southern economy that is still felt to this day.  There were black slaves in the Southern US that didn't want to be free - majority did of course.  But people celebrate and idolise the man because he did emancipate the slaves and ended slavery in America because it was the right thing to do.  Dany could have sacked the slave cities and moved on, that was the easy shorter path, it would have been selfish, it would have been logical if all she cared about was the iron throne.  Yet she didn't.

Yet she didn't.Didn't say she shouldn't have done it. Saying it was immature because she failed to think of the consequences. She assumed everyone would rejoice and the bad guys would just bow in fear because of her dragons. And I personally want to see the reactions of people who didn't think of the consequences either. Actions have consequences, regardless of how righteous they were. Something Dany failed to acknowledge and so does the audience because we are caught up in seeing the protagonist succeed.

Actions have consequences, regardless of how righteous they were. Something Dany failed to acknowledge and so does the audience because we are caught up in seeing the protagonist succeed.  Oh definitely, Dany can be very naAve.  She is a young teenage girl after all - with zero training for power (unlike Robb, Joffrey, Aegon etc).  These things happened in medieval Europe quite a lot.  While we would question following a 13 year old in battle or taking instruction from one, medieval people didn't think twice about it, partly because people died very young and so had to grow up all that quicker, partly because of the feudal system.  ADWD was all about letting the girl go and letting the woman be born.
2503	bobbybuilderton	2013-04-28	Oh I also didn't say she should have sacked the cities and left. My whole point is that she did not think of the consequences of sacking the city at all until after the fact. Oh hey wait a minute I have all these people and it'll probably be pretty hard to feed them and keep them safe. Oh hey maybe people who have been slaves all their lives will need an adjustment period. Oh hey maybe the slave trade is much bigger than I am and people will be seriously pissed that they're losing money. Oh hey maybe some will see this as an attack on the very foundation of their culture.What she did came from a good place. She has a kind heart and that's partly why Jorah is in love with her. But she was naive to just assume things would be great and impulsively act when she saw something she didn't like. I don't think she shouldn't have done it, I think she should have done it with a bit more forethought. It wasn't thought through well enough and we don't realize that in the moment, so we think next stop: Westeros. But then we're like oh...right.To summarize, go ahead and take the high road and the road less traveled, that's very commendable. But be smart about it and realistically prepare for how hard that will be. Dany did not. Continuing the American slavery subject, part of the tension in the civil war was that the south was warning that it would severely cripple their economy. It wasn't done lightly. These were adults who knew what the price would be for doing what they believed was right. Dany, on the other hand, has inherited a bit of her brother's delusions in regards to the way people see their family and heritage.I think Daenerys is one of the characters to have developed a lot from when we first met her, and for that I think she's an interesting character and all I meant is that I look forward to the "unsullied" fans reactions to her decision to stay behind. It's unexpected but at the same time you're kicking yourself because you're like "well duh she has a situation to deal with, how could she not? Liberation movements don't happen overnight!" I was frustrated that she stayed but I was also glad that she didn't just say "lol bye." Not following through, not owning up to her decisions and mistakes, and not making the marriage that was necessary rather than the marriage she wanted would have made her even more immature.

2504	Clariana	2013-05-01	He didn't care about Dany being able to command or not, he was just too wrapped up in his game to realise that someone might want to smash the board.Happens in real life as well. WWII is good example, Stalin was so wrapped up in his plans he didn't realise that Hitler's next target is USSR and ignored warnings; Allies initially uderestimated Germany and Germans, for the most part, underestimated the power of Britain and USA - because in both cases, part of the power came from smashing the board and playing a new game.... and Russia when the chips were down.  Britain and America would have had it tough without the red army.But this is OT.
2505	Pellaeon	2013-04-22	Or plan the Tyrells and Varys Sansa and Tyrion?
I recall there will be  scene with TQoT and Tyrion, then the meeting of Varys and TQoT. Knowing that Loras is gay, or better that they know, I would say they just putting the plot up to force Tywin to act.
Something like this: -pretend to want to marry Sansa to Loras -> tell Lord Tywin -> he acts -> Sansa marries Tyrion -> LF doesn't get the North ->maybe potential ally (The scene with Tyrion and Varys. Tyrion want revenge and varys is happy to help him because it suits his plans in the long term)
I just mean in the show, is Tywin actually played by them?
What do you think?
					
					
							Edited by Pellaeon, 22 April 2013 - 09:44 AM.
2506	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	I think Loras is the plan. Rather than include Willas, the writers have decided to take a shortcut and just use Loras instead. Which makes Sansa's situation only worse when she finds out she has to marry the Imp instead of the Knight of Flowers.
2507	Delmas	2013-04-22	yup sansa clearly has a lust for loras, I dont think the same can be said for Tyrion.
If you are asking whether tyrells planned on her marrying tyrion that is a big fat no, Tywin undermines their plans in an attempt to keep them from growing too strong
2508	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-22	Tywin undermines their plans in an attempt to keep them from growing too strongI see what you did there!
2509	Delmas	2013-04-22	I see what you did there!Hahah the growing strong pun was entirely by accident
2510	Kernest	2013-04-22	Yeah, it's smarter to use Loras than Willas, though it's not clear yet if they're removing Mace Tyrells other sons completely, because that'd make Loras the heir to Highgarden...
It seems that rather soon the Sansa/Tyrion marriage is happening, and they might even make Loras a member of the Kingsguard at the same time so that it'll match the books when we come to Feast and Dance.
2511	Alexander Stark	2013-04-22	Yeah thats alwys a criticism of the show for non-readers that it has too many characters, you need to kind of keep it down, I doubt willas will become important even in the books so they're right to ommit him and say Loras. Though when she is married to Tyrion then Loras should get his white cloak and Garlan should be introduced because he is my favourite minor character
2512	Loras Stan	2013-04-22	Yeah thats alwys a criticism of the show for non-readers that it has too many characters, you need to kind of keep it down, I doubt willas will become important even in the books so they're right to ommit him and say Loras. Though when she is married to Tyrion then Loras should get his white cloak and Garlan should be introduced because he is my favourite minor characterThis is what would actually be nice, but Garlan has not been cast, and the current S3 family tree for the Tyrells on the HBO website only has two children. And if "Sansa's place would be at Highgarden" as Margaery said...that means Loras is the heir.
2513	rejndjer	2013-04-22	there's one thing i don't understand, how is she gonna marry loras if he's member of KG?
2514	Lord Varys	2013-04-22	Choosing Loras as Sansa's match really is stupid. I did not think I'd mind that all that much, but considering that both Varys and Olenna are supposed to be shrewd and clever in the show I don't see how they would ever consider a match between a straight girl and gay man a good move. Especially Lady Olenna would arrange her very own domestic tragedy this way! Sansa won't adore Loras anymore after she has found out about his sexual preferences. A much better idea would have been to make Sansa believe they were about to betroth her to Loras but were instead trying to secure her for Willas.
As to the other Tyrell brothers: I guess they are still around. Loras will eventually join the Kingsguard, and then he'll end up ghastly burned and half-dead. Which would effectively leave Mace Tyrell without male heir. I don't see that happening, especially since both Willas and Garlan may play important roles later on.
2515	The Unborn	2013-04-22	He is not yet a member of the KG....
2516	BillBones	2013-04-22	there's one thing i don't understand, how is she gonna marry loras if he's member of KG?He'll probably become KG in order to avoid marrying her.Edit: Damn Unborn..

And in what way would anyone care if Sansa isn't happy with her marriage after it's done? They want her claim to the North, they aren't trying to set up a match making service. The Tyrell's aren't a bunch of friendly angels, they are as devious as everyone else and as soon as the marriage is done their plans would be complete.And even if we go by the books, Sansa would rather be married to a gay Loras than his cripple brother. She wouldn't be happy either way but at least she'd have her ideal image to show to others, even if it's a false one.

2519	Bannerman918	2013-04-22	Hahah the growing strong pun was entirely by accidenthahaa, you should have just owned it
2520	Greywolf2375	2013-04-22	there's one thing i don't understand, how is she gonna marry loras if he's member of KG?They may do the same thing that happened with Jaime - have the idea of the KG appointment come from the Lannisters/Joffrey so that the Tyrells almost couldn't turn it down.  Based on the conversation between Cersei and daddy dearest they may see the same opportunity and both push forward the Tyrion marriage as well as a perfectly good reason to join the KG.The gap would be that would leave the Tyrells with no heir to Highgarden, which does seem to be a problem.  I definitely would have preferred they just have the throwaway line of her marrying Willas instead of Loras, but we'll see how they handle it.
2521	Lord Varys	2013-04-22	But Lady Olenna's major concern beside the advancement of House Tyrell is the well-being of the members of her family. That's why Joffrey has to die, after all. To ensure that the alliance between Casterly Rock and Highgarden is going to work, not to terminate it.
And Loras won't be happy in a marriage with Sansa Stark. Neither will she. And if TV Loras truly turns out to be the heir to Highgarden, Sansa would be the mother to Mace Tyrell's grandchildren, including the next Lord of Highgarden. That is, as long as the marriage between Sansa and Loras is not going to be a marriage on paper. If Loras is the heir to Highgarden, he has to consummate his marriage. And an unhappy Lady Sansa of Highgarden could become a great problem for House Tyrell later on, if she starts to entertain herself with real men, ends up making fun of her effeminate husband, and so on. She could easily become a second Cersei.
Loras cannot be the heir to Highgarden, by the way. Neither Mace nor Olenna would have allowed Loras to join Renly's Kingsguard if he had been Mace's only son. Nor would they allowed him to enter into a long-term homosexual relationship when he has to secure the continuation of the main line of House Tyrell. It just doesn't make any sense. And the smart move of the Willas plot in the book was that Sansa would have been married to the eldest Tyrell son. Willas would have been Lord of Highgarden and Lord Protector of the North, and his eldest son heir to Highgarden and the North!
2522	Sun	2013-04-22	Yep. No mention of any other brother in the show, so Loras is it. Loras is not a member of the KG, yet. My guess Tywin will make him one in order to scuttle the marriage.
2523	stunningsteve	2013-04-22	In my mind the more interesting question concerning this topic is: Why did D&D let Varys propose it to the QoT?
One reason is obviously to show that Varys wants to cross Littlefinger's plans. But there might be another one. Varys knows that Loras is gay and propably would not consumate the marriage and so it could be nullified. Furthermore the Tyrells have always been quite loyal to the Targaryens. So he might give her to Loras to keep her safe from the Lannisters and LF but still useful for a possible later marriage. This might be a first setup for an Aegon-Sansa storyline.
2524	Warrior Queen	2013-04-22	I like that the show set it up this way.Sansa has had a crush on Loras since season one. It way more heartbreaking for her to first her she is going to marry her perfect Knight of Flowers, and than be forced to marry the imp.Plus it makes this line so much better. And even more painful.In the dark, I am the Knight of FlowersI have a feeling that Garlan won't make the show. I think they'll keep Willas for later on. The story of him getting crippled contributes to the fact that the Tyrell's and the Martell's don't like each other.

2525	Lord Varys	2013-04-22	Garlan could get a cameo during the Purple Wedding. Surely they'll have Mace attending the wedding of his precious daughter, why not show him with one of his sons, and his wife? The fact that Olenna continued to rant about her son, the audience is going to be quite eager to meet this oafish Lord Tyrell.
But I really doubt that Willas is going to be cut as an existing character.

She wouldn't be happy either way but at least she'd have her ideal image to show to others, even if it's a false one.Yes exactly. As you say, the Tyrells' don't care about whether she will be happy but rather only about her claim to the North.  This is stressed in the Varys-Olenna conversation when they say how should Robb fail then she is the key to the North.  And as Dontos told her in the books, the Tyrells are like the Lannisters only with thorns. But what I don't like about this change from the books is that Sansa was willing to make the marriage work with Willas who was a cripple despite not having met him and despite the fact that he was crippled.  She had determined in her mind to make him love her in time which is quite a mature thought process.  Now she just comes off as not having matured or changed that much at all.
2527	Loras Stan	2013-04-22	Loras cannot be the heir to Highgarden, by the way. Neither Mace nor Olenna would have allowed Loras to join Renly's Kingsguard if he had been Mace's only son. Nor would they allowed him to enter into a long-term homosexual relationship when he has to secure the continuation of the main line of House Tyrell. It just doesn't make any sense. And the smart move of the Willas plot in the book was that Sansa would have been married to the eldest Tyrell son. Willas would have been Lord of Highgarden and Lord Protector of the North, and his eldest son heir to Highgarden and the North!You bring up some really good points. If he was the heir he wouldn't have been pledged to Renly as he was. But I feel D&amp;D is just forgetting all this stuff, so as not having to introduce more Tyrells. I don't know--sometimes I think they are doing well with things, but this is just shoddily done, and creates more questions/problems than just adding Willas "not appearing in person" Tyrell.I can only hope they get wise to this, and add Garlan and/or Tyrell s4/s5. But I'm not holding my breath.

2528	Lord Varys	2013-04-22	They have not yet made Loras Mace's only son in the show. So there's still hope left. They seem to be not so confident in namedropping characters who won't make an appearance on the show in the near future (neither Trystane, nor Doran Martell were mentioned during season 2, when Tyrion arranged Myrcella's betrothal), and I can understand that to a degree.
But the fact that ASoS was split in two seasons should have bought both the time and the opportunity to make Willas an interesting off-screen character. I realize that choosing Loras instead was tempting, but it really causes more problems that it solves, and if they wanted to give additional scenes to Finn Jones and Sophie Turner, they could have done so easily enough. It would have been really funny, for instance, if Margaery and Olenna had unwittingly (?) led both Sansa and the audience to believe that Sansa was supposed to marry Loras.
2529	Runaway Penguin	2013-04-22	Yes exactly. As you say, the Tyrells' don't care about whether she will be happy but rather only about her claim to the North.  This is stressed in the Varys-Olenna conversation when they say how should Robb fail then she is the key to the North.  And as Dontos told her in the books, the Tyrells are like the Lannisters only with thorns.Do not forget Dontos had reason to say so as well, and reason to dissuade Sansa - because Littlefinger is after her claim as well.
2530	The Unborn	2013-04-22	Yes exactly. As you say, the Tyrells' don't care about whether she will be happy but rather only about her claim to the North.  This is stressed in the Varys-Olenna conversation when they say how should Robb fail then she is the key to the North.  And as Dontos told her in the books, the Tyrells are like the Lannisters only with thorns. But what I don't like about this change from the books is that Sansa was willing to make the marriage work with Willas who was a cripple despite not having met him and despite the fact that he was crippled.  She had determined in her mind to make him love her in time which is quite a mature thought process.  Now she just comes off as not having matured or changed that much at all.You seem to forget that she was willing to love Willas because it was a way to escape King's Landing and Joff. Because the Tyrells were so good to her. Because she would be the lady of Highgarden. Not because she was in love with a cripple who she never even met.
2531	MacNille	2013-04-22	I would have been alot happier if it was Garlan or Willas. That would have made alot more sense then Loras. I'm also that kind of guy who want everything from the book into the show.
2532	Gannicus	2013-04-22	This is a great change. Loras can easily play the role of the other two brothers up through ADWD, and it will be so much more powerful knowing Sansa actually wants Loras.
2533	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-04-22	Choosing Loras as Sansa's match really is stupid. I did not think I'd mind that all that much, but considering that both Varys and Olenna are supposed to be shrewd and clever in the show I don't see how they would ever consider a match between a straight girl and gay man a good move. Especially Lady Olenna would arrange her very own domestic tragedy this way! Sansa won't adore Loras anymore after she has found out about his sexual preferences. A much better idea would have been to make Sansa believe they were about to betroth her to Loras but were instead trying to secure her for Willas.As to the other Tyrell brothers: I guess they are still around. Loras will eventually join the Kingsguard, and then he'll end up ghastly burned and half-dead. Which would effectively leave Mace Tyrell without male heir. I don't see that happening, especially since both Willas and Garlan may play important roles later on.This doesn't make any sense. They don't care that Loras is gay. He is an heir to great family and (until he joins the KG) he has a certain duty to produce more heirs. Renly's sexual preferences didn't stop the Tyrells from having Margaery marry him.
2534	Elba the Intoner	2013-04-22	You seem to forget that she was willing to love Willas because it was a way to escape King's Landing and Joff. Because the Tyrells were so good to her. Because she would be the lady of Highgarden. Not because she was in love with a cripple who she never even met.No I didn't forget that.  However, despite that she didn't have many other choices and was desperate to get out of King's Landing, we did see in her thought process that she would try to make the best of the situation.  She wanted to be a good wife to someone whom she had never met and had learned that he was crippled, which was a sign of her maturing and learning to accept a situation that was not her ideal anymore.  We won't get that with this change to her marrying Loras.
2535	Minsc	2013-04-22	No I didn't forget that.  However, despite that she didn't have many other choices and was desperate to get out of King's Landing, we did see in her thought process that she would try to make the best of the situation.  She wanted to be a good wife to someone whom she had never met and had learned that he was crippled, which was a sign of her maturing and learning to accept a situation that was not her ideal anymore.  We won't get that with this change to her marrying Loras.If we got that it might led to a situation where viewers don't extremely sympathize with poor Tyrion when "shallow" Sansa rejects him during their marriage, instead there could be a possibility of the viewer being angry at the savior Tyrion when he crushes her dreams.  And we are know that TV show cannot portray Tyrion as a morally complex and grey character.
2536	sagaz	2013-04-22	Or plan the Tyrells and Varys Sansa and Tyrion?I recall there will be  scene with TQoT and Tyrion, then the meeting of Varys and TQoT. Knowing that Loras is gay, or better that they know, I would say they just putting the plot up to force Tywin to act.Something like this: -pretend to want to marry Sansa to Loras -> tell Lord Tywin -> he acts -> Sansa marries Tyrion -> LF doesn't get the North ->maybe potential ally (The scene with Tyrion and Varys. Tyrion want revenge and varys is happy to help him because it suits his plans in the long term)I just mean in the show, is Tywin actually played by them?What do you think?It could be... it's a very fine Varys scheme.
2537	All-for-Joffrey	2013-04-22	I think people in this thread are making way too much hay about Loras being gay.What do they care if he's gay? The bottom line is that all nobles, particularly the Great houses, need all their children to marry to ensure their line and strengthen their position (in this case getting the best available claim to Winterfell and the North). Loras' sexual orientation is simply not a factor in the equation. Even if he is a third son. If they had thought this was an issue, why did they let their daughter Margery marry Renly in the first place? Oh right, for political reasons!For those that think Loras would be unable to produce heirs with Sansa or would be as obtuse as Renly was about making babies with Margery, I'm sure the Queen of Thrones would insist on standing over the bed with a stick beating Loras until he inseminated her. Or something (you know HBO would go there).Anyway, back from the realm of the creepy, in order to mirror Sansa's shock and disappointment to learn that she's marrying a cripple (Willas) like in the books, maybe a subplot over the next episode or two could involve her learning that Loras is gay, which would obviously make her about as dismayed as learning that her future husband is a cripple.Also, to whatever poster mentioned Loras' future wife potentially mocking him for being gay and effeminate -- what exactly about Loras strikes you as effeminate? Or are you just displaying cultural stereotypes and equating homosexuality with effeminacy?

2538	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-22	I think people in this thread are making way too much hay about Loras being gay.What do they care if he's gay?I think Sansa certainly would care, and it adds even more depth to Margaery's character.  Here she is, playing Sansa's best friend.  "Oh, we'll be sisters when you wed my amazingly handsome brother!"  But how thrilled would Sansa be in a marriage where her husband has zero sexual attraction towards her, and likely will be banging guardsmen on the side?  Margaery doesn't give a shit.  Having a Stark marry into her family sets them up very nice politically in the event there is a subsequent falling out between the Lannisters and Tyrells.  And if the price is Sansa Stark being in a loveless marriage, well, that's no skin off Margaery's ass, is it?She's not book Margery, but damn, she's a great character, very well-played.

2539	Harrad	2013-04-22	Choosing Loras for Sansa is a great idea for the TV story with or without the compression of characters from the book. Loras has a history with Sansa, at least in GoT. This is one more "education of Sansa" moments when she, for a moment, thinks that there will be a storybook ending for her, when she gets the "True Knight" she wanted and deserved.
2540	Blue Steel	2013-04-22	It doesn't make sense that Vary would want the Tyrells and the Starks to be allied considering his plans for Aegon.  A strong Tyrell faction is at odds with Aegon becoming king unless Varys has some plan to get the Tyrells to dump Tommen and put Margaery with Aegon.
2541	Mr Hodor	2013-04-22	cant use wilas, he hasnt been introduced yet and wont be used after this.
2542	scurvy	2013-04-22	If Margaery had just said, "her brother" and not "Loras" then the viewer and Sansa could easily be made to believe it was Loras when it was really the cripple brother Willas all along.  No need to cast him, he's not leaving Highgarden anyway.  And, the Queen of Thorns could have said, "no, no you silly girl, Ser Loras is staying at Court with Margaery as her sworn shield, you will be at Highgarden, tucked away with my son's heir."

2543	MyLittleDirewolf	2013-04-22	The show changing Willas to Loras is fine IMHO. No need to mention an off-screen character we will likely never meet, it is established the Sansa has a crush on Loras, and it (maybe?) will make Sansa a bit more sympathetic when she has her dream squashed. That Loras is gay doesn't matter, he has to know he'll be roped into a marriage sooner or later. Perhaps after the Sansa marriage close-call, that's when he joins the KG on the show. Or Tywin talks him into it, to pull the same trick on the Tyrells that the Mad King did with Jaime.
We don't know that Renly had the same never-marry rule for his KG that the Iron Throne kings do/did. But in any case, the Tyrells were hitching their wagon to Renly, thinking he would be the King, and perhaps a son of  Marg/Renly would become heir to Highgarden (in show-verse). Or like the QoT has stated, Mace Tyrell is an oaf, and he never thought it through.
2544	Kasrith	2013-04-22	Choosing Loras as Sansa's match really is stupid. I did not think I'd mind that all that much, but considering that both Varys and Olenna are supposed to be shrewd and clever in the show I don't see how they would ever consider a match between a straight girl and gay man a good move. Especially Lady Olenna would arrange her very own domestic tragedy this way! Sansa won't adore Loras anymore after she has found out about his sexual preferences. A much better idea would have been to make Sansa believe they were about to betroth her to Loras but were instead trying to secure her for Willas.It doesn't matter if she adores him or not, they just need her to adore him now so that they can get her out of KL. After she's married and they have the North behind them who cares if she's in a happy marriage?The one thing I didn't necessarily like about all that is the fact that Margaery is supposed to feel safe by Joff's side cause her bro is a KG, which I guess also doesn't matter in the show cause she's the puppeteer
2545	Tywin's bastard	2013-04-22	But Lady Olenna's major concern beside the advancement of House Tyrell is the well-being of the members of her family. That's why Joffrey has to die, after all. To ensure that the alliance between Casterly Rock and Highgarden is going to work, not to terminate it.And Loras won't be happy in a marriage with Sansa Stark. Neither will she. And if TV Loras truly turns out to be the heir to Highgarden, Sansa would be the mother to Mace Tyrell's grandchildren, including the next Lord of Highgarden. That is, as long as the marriage between Sansa and Loras is not going to be a marriage on paper. If Loras is the heir to Highgarden, he has to consummate his marriage. And an unhappy Lady Sansa of Highgarden could become a great problem for House Tyrell later on, if she starts to entertain herself with real men, ends up making fun of her effeminate husband, and so on. She could easily become a second Cersei.Loras cannot be the heir to Highgarden, by the way. Neither Mace nor Olenna would have allowed Loras to join Renly's Kingsguard if he had been Mace's only son. Nor would they allowed him to enter into a long-term homosexual relationship when he has to secure the continuation of the main line of House Tyrell. It just doesn't make any sense. And the smart move of the Willas plot in the book was that Sansa would have been married to the eldest Tyrell son. Willas would have been Lord of Highgarden and Lord Protector of the North, and his eldest son heir to Highgarden and the North!The well-being that's in concern about Joffrey is that he might harm Margaery, not in any way about if Margaery will be happily married in general. They realize that Joffrey would be harder to control than his little brother, which is why he's gotten rid of.Loras won't be happy in marriage with any woman but that's irrelevant. He has a duty to marry and produce sons and he will be forced to do that. That Sansa would pose problems is also a pretty ridiculous notion. She's clearly proven herself to be someone that just acts along and has shown no scheming or temper despite being betrothed to a monster. Loras would treat her gently, just not love her. Your arguments here become even weaker when it's a fact that the Tyrells have already married Margaery to another gay man. A man who was sleeping with her brother, which wasn't a secret to them. Such things are so trivial compared to the actual point of noble marriage (alliances and land) that they aren't even worth mentioning.Regarding the King's Guard, Loras hasn't joined the KG in the show (yet) so that's completely irrelevant. He obviously won't join until the Lannisters forces Sansa to marry Tyrion, if he joins it at all. And in any case it's smarter to not marry the heir to Highgarden to Sansa in the case of all Stark men being killed. Better to have two Tyrells with the honor of being Wardens than one.
2546	Versiroth	2013-04-22	I liked it.   Especially for the viewers that don't know the story.   They'll believe that Sansa will find some form of happiness before it's stripped away and she's forced to marry Tyrion.   I actually hope they have Loras court her a little so her surprise wedding to Tyrion hits even harder.
2547	Loras Stan	2013-04-22	This also ties in with the scene we saw in the behind the scenes video--of Loras storming off from a table. I'm pretty sure he's not going to be happy with the whole marriage idea. He'll go along with it, because of family, but I think he's going to really dislike the idea.
2548	cybobbie	2013-04-22	In my mind the more interesting question concerning this topic is: Why did D&D let Varys propose it to the QoT?One reason is obviously to show that Varys wants to cross Littlefinger's plans. But there might be another one. Varys knows that Loras is gay and propably would not consumate the marriage and so it could be nullified. Furthermore the Tyrells have always been quite loyal to the Targaryens. So he might give her to Loras to keep her safe from the Lannisters and LF but still useful for a possible later marriage. This might be a first setup for an Aegon-Sansa storyline.Liked the way you put, it could be a good plan that of course will change with Sansa'a marriage with Tyrion and will work again since this marriage will also not be consumated. But I still believe that they will have to come with another Tyrell son in the show, considering the whole heir of Highgarden issue.
2549	Charles Phipps	2013-04-22	Point of order, if Renly and Margery's match had taken place, their second son could have inherited Highgarden through Margery.
I.e. they had a Joffrey and Tommen situation planned.
Tywin, I suspect, would have placed Tommen on Casterly Rock if Jaime wouldn't bend.
2550	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-04-22	I liked it.   Especially for the viewers that don't know the story.   They'll believe that Sansa will find some form of happiness before it's stripped away and she's forced to marry Tyrion.   I actually hope they have Loras court her a little so her surprise wedding to Tyrion hits even harder.This! My unsullied family believes that Littlefinger is going to swoop in and take Sansa away from the Tyrells due to his 'interest' in her.  They will be very surprised at what actually happens. I also think it builds additional sympathy for Sansa since she is so obviously happy about the idea of marrying Loras.
2551	Minsc	2013-04-22	It doesn't matter if she adores him or not, they just need her to adore him now so that they can get her out of KL. After she's married and they have the North behind them who cares if she's in a happy marriage?The problem is that losing the Willas's option is meant to fill like a punch in the gut for the readers as she loses another opportunity for happiness and now is stuck with the Lannisters.  Yet, in the TWOP Unspoiled Page you have TV watchers feeling pity for Sansa that she is going to escape to Highgarden with Loras who won't love her and think it would be better if she was stuck with Tyrion.Simply, they lost out on one of the many gut wrenching moments in the books along with one of the displays of Sansa's character's growth because they were to lazy to just introduce a character that they don't even have to cast.  Furthermore, they have set up a series of negative reactions of viewers calling Sansa shallow and stupid when she doesn't bow down at the majesty of Peter Dinklage's character.

2554	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-04-22	I get what you all are saying. Tyrion on TV vs. Book Tyrion is much more likeable and a more sympathetic character, TV viewers could also see it as saving her from LIttlefinger.  They will need to play up that she is marrying the family that killed her father and conspired in the upcoming RW.  Something to ponder over the next week...

People are really starting to like her (just another one of those 180s along with Jaime and slowly but surely Theon), and I'm sure people are going to want her to get out. When Loras and LF fail, she'll be devastated to remain with the Lannisters and sympathy will certainly be felt.

I mean, I'm sure that there are some folks who like her, just as there are some who find her a dim, annoying twit.  She's a somewhat controversial character in that respect among book readers, and I think it's the same among viewers.  It's kind of hard to ignore the contrast in brains between her and Margeary as portrayed to viewers.
2560	Hound's She-wolf	2013-04-22	Sansa has been trashed over the years in this forum for not being nicer to Tyrion when they were married, now that tv!Tyrion is so well loved, she is going to get slaughtered.
2561	Dove	2013-04-22	To be fair to Sansa, it's clear that Margaery's been groomed for this sort of thing her entire life by a clever, savvy family, and she is much, much better prepared for it. Sansa isn't dim so much as sheltered and woefully naive, and her family didn't do anything to really help her prepare for the den of vipers that is King's Landing.
Sansa and Cat definitely inspire a bizarre amount of hate and blame on various internet communities, it's a phenomenon I've never quite understood. It's disappointing but whatever, you can't let random peoples' weird opinions alter your enjoyment of a character or story.

Odd, in a world when we fight for acceptance, many still aren't comfortable with women using their brains rather than their muscles or charms to survive instead of fighting. Sansa would be an idiot if she dares to contradict the Lannister. Perhaps many of her "fans" would be more pleased if she tries to escape KL just to be caught half and hour later and beheaded next to her father because "at least she was brave".

2567	Red Knight	2013-04-22	i would still have liked it if they intoduced willas's existence, he should be important in the last books and thus in the series too
2568	Loras Stan	2013-04-22	While Loras is portrayed as gay, maybe he's bisexual and could get the deed done well enough to create an heir (unlike Renly)A gay man can do the deed as well. It might just take some 'fluffing', but there are plenty of men who are homosexual who end up having children with women through intercourse. And honestly? Loras doesn't care about Sansa. He tolerates her, he plays nice, and would do so most likely in a marriage, but they both wouldn't be happy. Sansa has created a idea of Loras in her head that is quite far off from the man he is. Loras? In the book joins the KG not just to protect Margaery, but to make sure that he never has to marry, and has an excuse for never being involved in another relationship. At this juncture, after Renly's death, he wants *no* part in anything that has to do with marriage/faking love/affection.Obviously that's not what happened on the show (as he's the heir), but still, as happy as Sansa is, Loras is going to be the exact opposite.

Characters have been altered for the tv plot, why not their relationship? I'm in no way claiming that she'll be thrilled, they just might tone her down a bit.

Characters have been altered for the tv plot, why not their relationship?I'm in no way claiming that she'll be thrilled, they just might tone her down a bit.I should have put nice in quotes. I think she has been unfairly condemned by certain segments of this fandom because she did not fall in love with her "savior" and didn't sleep with him and didn't see him as some great white knight. I think she was as nice as a scared, imprisoned and abused child could be but for some people, it was not enough.You are right, we have no idea what D&D will do to her character, it just seems like a big set up, that in the tv show, Tyrion is such a fan favorite, that if she rejects him she will be again called everything from shallow, to stupid to prejudiced against little people (it has all happened before so it can happen again).

2571	MoA«t	2013-04-22	It's actually brilliant to have Sansa think she's marrying Loras, rather than someone neither she, nor the audience will ever meet. And there's no way to see through her eyes in the show like there is in the books. 
It was established in season one that she has a SuperCrush on Loras, so her emotional crash on having to marry Tyrion will be epic.

No matter what we know about Loras, the fact is that she's madly in love with him and this is her dream that's being dangled in front of her. Either way is a lose-lose for Sansa, but she doesn't know it. Oh, Sansa, dear, you're barking up the wrong tree. In a few different ways. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
2573	MoA«t	2013-04-22	No I didn't forget that.  However, despite that she didn't have many other choices and was desperate to get out of King's Landing, we did see in her thought process that she would try to make the best of the situation.  She wanted to be a good wife to someone whom she had never met and had learned that he was crippled, which was a sign of her maturing and learning to accept a situation that was not her ideal anymore.  We won't get that with this change to her marrying Loras.Indeed, however, that was all we learn in her head, from her POV chapter in the book. Much harder to portray in the show, and far less dramatic than her heartbreak will be not actually marrying Loras.LOVE your Cupid and Psyche avatar!!!!

And Marg can't very well tell her "hey we want to marry you to our gay brother and when Robb dies you'll have a claim on Winterfell so the Tyrells will also get WF!"

Loras's place is protecting Margaery, in the Kings Guard.

2577	ThePrinceOfSunspear	2013-04-22	I hate this whole Loras/Sansa thing. To me its unnecessary. I understand that there are some slow people who might not grasp the concept of having more than 1 son or a show having a lot of characters but to me its not staying true to the nature of the books.
2578	Minsc	2013-04-22	Please stop projecting your thoughts and feelings on to "the viewers." You only speak for yourself, not the rest of us.I am responding directly to some posts that some TV only viewers have made on the TWOP forums, moreover as others have mentioned there has been past history where she received sharp criticism for her actions regarding the marriage with Tyrion. Therefore, it is not wrong to hypothesis that there might be a negative reaction from some members of the viewing base to her actions when reflecting on how they have currently set things up.
2579	Darth Pipes	2013-04-22	Truth be told, a Loras not in the Kingsguard makes the most sense to marry Sansa.  Willas is the heir of Highgarden.  While marrying the oldest daughter (and suspected heir) of House Stark is a logical marriage, he's not going up to the North.  Garlan is married and about to take over Brightwater keep, he's not going up North.  Loras is a knight of some fame but he's got no lands.  He could go up to Winterfell and rule in Sansa's name.  Although I can't see the Greatjohn kneeling to a guy called The Knight of Flowers.
2580	stiff_pirates	2013-04-22	I think we're missing the intentions of the Tyrells and Lannisters regarding power.
Both know that Sansa is the key to the North (as Varys mentions in this episode), so having her at Highgarden would be preferable to the Tyrells.
Loras is not yet a member of the Kingsguard, in the books he is only just recently a sworn knight of the Kingsguard before Jamie returns. This means there is an opening for him to marry Sansa. We've seen previously that Margaery and Mace Tyrell had direct plans for Margaery as Queen (whoever her partner King may have been). Having the same intentions for powerful positions through Loras seems to be legitimate. Also, Sansa would never dismiss an offer like that.
Unfortunately, Tywin catches wind of the scheme and counters the proposition with the immediate marriage to Tyrion. The scene between Tyrion and Tywin in Episode 2 hinted at a "use" for Tyrion, which book readers know the outcome is their marriage.
Tywin basically then reserves the Stark/North legacy for the Lannisters. He does this by having Cersei request him to join the KG, to which Loras cannot decline. Essentially it does give Loras a 'fly on the wall' position for small council meetings and royal secrets etc, which is why he takes the position too
Loras is the vessel for Sansa's title to the Tyrell's.

Which I know, I know, hasn't happened in the show yet.Also, http://viewers-guide.../houses/tyrell/ this leads people to believe that they have completely cut Garlan and Willas out.The guide is there to help people, but it's irrelevant in this. Shireen wasn't mentionned once in S2, people tought for sure she was cut, but time proved them wrong.
2582	The Anti-Targ	2013-04-22	It does look Like Mace Tyrell will only have one son, just like Davos seems to only have one son. That's fine for the current situation, because it makes Loras heir to Highgarden, and the Tyrell plan was to have Sansa marry the heir to Highgarden. I do wonder what the Tyrell's will do for an heir once Loras joins the KG though, which they surely will have him do in the show. I suppose Margaery's 2nd born son would become heir to Highgarden in the TV version if she ever gets around to having any children. Though I suppose technically the heir to the throne can also be the heir to the Wardenhip of one of the 7Ks. Having no heir to Highgarden other than Marg does put the Lannisters too uncomfortably close to running the Reach once Mace is dead and gone. Though the story is running out of Lannisters who have any claim on titles as fast as anyone.
2583	Lord_Ravenstone	2013-04-22	I think Mace has other sons. 
There's just no need to mention them just yet unless they might introduce them soon or it's absolutely necessary. 
Loras x Sansa makes a lot of sense since he's not in the KG at the moment.
2584	MarieAntoinette	2013-04-23	Yeah, it's smarter to use Loras than Willas, though it's not clear yet if they're removing Mace Tyrells other sons completely, because that'd make Loras the heir to Highgarden...It seems that rather soon the Sansa/Tyrion marriage is happening, and they might even make Loras a member of the Kingsguard at the same time so that it'll match the books when we come to Feast and Dance.This is one of the changes I don't mind. The show already has so many characters crammed into 10 episodes, I'm fine that they go with Loras.
2585	KnightsOfDany	2013-04-23	10 to 1 this is a rehash of what was said but hell ill say it anyway.
As a faithful book man i have to say i could care less for this change, it makes total sense in show terms. Why introduce another Tyrell when the show has set up Sansa loving Loras already.
	Spoiler In an episode or two Tyrion will be made to marry Sansa and introducing a pointless character (at the time) will all be for not.

No harm no foul
2586	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-04-23	The reason that Loras has to be the plan is that Littlefinger is leaving the capital this next episode and he's planning on taking Sansa with him.
Sansa must choose to stay in the capital and reject LF offer to go to the Vale. LF will tell Sansa that the Tyrells are only interested in her "name and claim to Winterfell" not to her happiness or she will realize it herself.
Once she's betrothed to Tyrion and the Tyrell's do nothing to help her she will see that everyone is just interested in her claim and then she will decide to escape.

2587	Newstar	2013-04-23	Bryan Cogman has confirmed in the comments to the 3x04 Recap post that Loras in the show is not in the Kingsguard.Also, Natalie Dormer did an interview for Vulture which seemingly confirmed that Loras is now Sansa's intended in the show and not Willas:Q: That's true. They keep changing things that were in the books, sometimes out of practicality. For instance, instead of offering Margaery's other brother Willas as a potential fiancA© to Sansa, it's now Loras. Which of course feeds into Sansa's fairy-tale fantasy, because she is oblivious that he's gay.A: Yes, she is, bless her. So it actually enhances the story, the way it works now, because Loras gave Sansa his favor back at the tourney and she's infatuated. That's a good example of how sometimes the slight alterations can enhance and not necessarily detract from the books. (...) But there are just so many characters in the books, and they've got to draw the line somewhere in this ever-expanding cast. They're trying to keep the numbers down! [Laughs.]I actually think it's an elegant change: streamlines the cast of characters, draws on something from a previous season (Sansa's infatuation with Ser Loras from Season 1), makes use of an actor who needs to be given something to do (Finn Jones), etc. It also streamlines the character arc, a bit, and in a series like this, there isn't a lot of room for non-essential, overarching plot-related character development. We don't have to waste time on learning about some random dude we don't know from Adam, trying to care about this guy we've never seen, watching Sansa struggle with coming around to accepting Willas as a suitor, moving from disappointment to acceptance to eagerness, etc. We know Loras, and we know she has a crush on Loras and is oblivious to his inclinations, so the minute Margaery floats the marriage as a potential future for Sansa in 3x04, we know all we need to know in that moment from her genuine, thrilled smile. It saves time, and as there are something like 11 ongoing storylines at any given point in the show, time is a precious commodity. And also, when she is denied Loras, her romantic ideal in the books and in the show, her disappointment will be all the more crushing.

I'm a little confused because the situation with Bran and Rickon is shaky at best. There's been no confirmation of their deaths, just speculation. I'll be really interested if Roose sends Robb a message about Bran and Rickon being dead (now that Bolton knows they aren't through Ramsey).

When they state that Sansa is the key to the North if Robb Stark dies, Varys and Olenna are talking as if Winterfell is known to be sacked and burned and Bran and Rickon are believed to be dead, but there's been no indication that this news has reached KL by the opening of Season 3. It only reached Catelyn and Robb in 3x02. Nor has there been any confirmation from Sansa that she believes her brothers are dead (which, in the books, she learned after ACOK but before the start of the events in ASOS). The only way Sansa is the key to the North in the event of Robb's death is if Bran and Rickon are already dead, and there's been no indication that anyone in KL knows this. Tyrion didn't mention Sansa's claim when discussing her desirability as a bride in 3x02, only her "very old name."Either Sansa is still fourth in line but is still a valuable marriage prospect because of the Stark name, or all that stands between Sansa's husband and the North is Robb Stark. The writers should pick one. It looks like Tywin's going to give Tyrion the "come to Jesus" talk about marrying Sansa Stark in 3x05, so maybe the writers will have figured out what KL does or doesn't know by then.

I'll be really interested if Roose sends Robb a message about Bran and Rickon being dead (now that Bolton knows they aren't through Ramsey).Varys made a comment to Joffrey about how his little birds in the North have been silent since Theon took Winterfell. This is right before Joffrey gives his "red smile to Stannis" speech.
2591	Lord Varys	2013-04-23	On the Kingsguard thing:
TV Loras was the Lord Commander of TV Renly's Kingsguard! We all do know that he has not yet joined Joffrey's Kingsguard. That much is obvious! But if Loras was Mace's only son in the show, the whole Renly marriage thing would have effectively destroyed the line of succession of Highgarden. Both Margaery and Loras would have been out of the picture as heirs of Highgarden. Margaery would be Renly's queen, Loras his real consort and Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Who will take over as Lord of Highgarden when Mace dies?
Shrewd Lady Olenna would never have allowed both of Mace's children to bind themselves permanently to Joffrey if this would have severely threatened the continuation of the main line of House Tyrell!
They have to keep at least Willas as an existing person in the show, even if he does not appear on screen. And considering that Tywin is going to consider a lot of possible Tyrell-Lannister matches before and after Joffrey's death (first Cersei-Willas to soften the slight after Tywin steals Sansa, then Cersei-Willas - which Mace first accepts, and Olenna later declines -, and finally Jaime-Margaery after Joffrey's death) they could use Willas for that later on. It would be stupid to omit Loras joining Joffrey's Kingsguard completely, and it would be much more interesting to try to marry Cersei to a cripple instead of a gay youth. Especially since Tywin's intention in marrying both his twins off is to convince the public that there is no truth to the twincest rumors. Marrying Cersei to a gay man is not going to convince the people who know about Loras' sexuality that this is going to be a real marriage...
2592	Woman of War	2013-04-23	Sansa and Cat definitely inspire a bizarre amount of hate and blame on various internet communities, it's a phenomenon I've never quite understood. It's disappointing but whatever, you can't let random peoples' weird opinions alter your enjoyment of a character or story.But most of the things the showmakers might wish to wash off Tyrion have not yet happened. So far Shae and Tywin are alive, Symon Silvertongue has not yet shown up and boy Tyrion's tragic guilt in his own and Tysha's abuse has not been part of the story. So the viewer simply cannot see where Tyrion should be a particularly grey or even dark character. The murders happen later and his (self) destructive phase of ADWD is far away.The problem is that it seems like the TV producers are the ones setting up that reaction by the deletion of a moment of character development for Sansa and their complete whitewashing of any flaws of Tyrion thus creating little apparent reason for why Sansa should reject him or why viewers should be worried for her.There are several aspects: in the book Sansa is simply too young to have sex with anyone (with Willas as well, of course but posters conveniently choose to ignore that). Look at Turner and you can forget that argument. Little girl Sansa in the books simply has no idea what being married might mean, neither to Joffrey nor Willas "She simply had no idea what was expected from her". The older HBO Sansa can make an active choice of whom she desires or not.And in the series they simply emphazise the fact that Sansa is only wanted for her claim by whomever, making Willas love her would have never happened, she is a claim on legs. It is Margaery and Olenna (interesting? Not particularly, but her claim is) who draw the strings, not caring about Sansa's and Loras' wishes. Of course with the highly intelligent Margaery Sansa pales as character but she is endearing in her naivety, people will still pity her for getting her illusions crushed. And viewers will  be more worried for her safety when she is with Tyrion than with Loras since at the moment Loras is in a secure position while Tyrion's situation is dire and Sansa and Tyrion can be victims of Joffrey's madness any time.

2595	Stargareyen	2013-04-23	But Lady Olenna's major concern beside the advancement of House Tyrell is the well-being of the members of her family. That's why Joffrey has to die, after all. To ensure that the alliance between Casterly Rock and Highgarden is going to work, not to terminate it.And Loras won't be happy in a marriage with Sansa Stark. Neither will she. And if TV Loras truly turns out to be the heir to Highgarden, Sansa would be the mother to Mace Tyrell's grandchildren, including the next Lord of Highgarden. That is, as long as the marriage between Sansa and Loras is not going to be a marriage on paper. If Loras is the heir to Highgarden, he has to consummate his marriage. And an unhappy Lady Sansa of Highgarden could become a great problem for House Tyrell later on, if she starts to entertain herself with real men, ends up making fun of her effeminate husband, and so on. She could easily become a second Cersei.Loras cannot be the heir to Highgarden, by the way. Neither Mace nor Olenna would have allowed Loras to join Renly's Kingsguard if he had been Mace's only son. Nor would they allowed him to enter into a long-term homosexual relationship when he has to secure the continuation of the main line of House Tyrell. It just doesn't make any sense. And the smart move of the Willas plot in the book was that Sansa would have been married to the eldest Tyrell son. Willas would have been Lord of Highgarden and Lord Protector of the North, and his eldest son heir to Highgarden and the North!Frankly, it is entirely incorrect to equate gay to effeminate and being unable to consummate a marriage. Gay men are not impotent, and a big chunk of them are not even effeminate (both apply to Loras). Loras's sexual acts happen behind close doors and though people talk about him having slept with Renly, that piece is pure rumor just like the parentage of Joffrey.Not introducing Garlan or other sons of Mace is definitely a decision to save on money, and it doesn't hurt to let TV viewers think of Loras as heir to Highgarden. There is no need to even discuss if Sansa would be happy with him or not, there must be tons of marriages in Westeros done for pure strategic alliances.

2596	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-23	Yeah, the show has made a bit of a hash out of Sansa's claim. When they state that Sansa is the key to the North if Robb Stark dies, Varys and Olenna are talking as if Winterfell is known to be sacked and burned and Bran and Rickon are believed to be dead, but there's been no indication that this news has reached KL by the opening of Season 3. It only reached Catelyn and Robb in 3x02.I don't think there's any reason to believe that it hasn't reached the upper echelons of KL, though, even if it wasn't shown, and even if Sansa wasn't told.  After all, she's pretty isolated from the outside. Clearly, Bolton knew that Winterfell had fallen, so presumably, it would leak out into the troops, and from there, all it takes is a raven and the secret is out.  After all, Winterfell falling is huge news.
2597	Lady Sansa Stark	2013-04-23	I'm still waiting for a scene where Sansa expresses grief for her brothers, or when someone in King's Landing talks about what happened. Maybe it'll come after the Red Wedding (it has to come after the Red Wedding), or Tywin will bring it up next episode? After all, from what I've seen from the preview, they'll tell Tyrion to marry Sansa. What good would that be if Bran and Rickon were still alive?

After all, from what I've seen from the preview, they'll tell Tyrion to marry Sansa. What good would that be if Bran and Rickon were still alive?What good? Insurance. It's a win win situation for Tywin, his dwarf son has been married off to a girl of the highest rank of nobility and he makes sure that no one else can come along and try to claim the north through her if anything happens to the male heirs. Tywin doesn't lose anything by forcing this marriage whether or not Bran and Rickon are alive.

With Tyrion her place is in King's Landing where she is at risk whereas with Loras she is in Highgarden.Joffrey's views on homosexuality are irrelevant.
2601	Mammothsbane	2013-04-23	Joffrey's views on homosexuality is just another reason to hate him. It's also possible D&D are making shit up and suggesting that Joff's a homosexual (especially after that whore scene from last season).
Sansa is going to get some serious backlash once she gets depressed that she's marrying Tyrion and not Loras. Show viewers who LOVE Tyrion are going to crucify her for not jumping into his arms because he's not handsome enough. Going to be rough for poor Sophie Turner.
Also, Loras being the only son of Mace makes it strange when he joins the Kingsguard. Why would the only son of the Warden of the South and heir to Highgarden give up his claim like that? Doesn't make much sense. Unless they work in a younger sibling of Loras' that doesn't exist to justify it

It's true Loras didn't care much for titles after Renly died, but he was the youngest son. Him joining the Kingsguard made more sense in the books. But I don't think it really matters all that much anyway.
2606	Dove	2013-04-23	I'm not sure, actually - he either says it to her or to Jaime, when he basically straight up asks, "Hey bro, like every woman in the seven kingdoms wants a piece of you, what's with the Kingsguard thing?" Either way I hope they work in that line somewhere, Loras is a pretty neat guy and right up there in my list of "cool background character dudes."

2607	Newstar	2013-04-23	Sansa is going to get some serious backlash once she gets depressed that she's marrying Tyrion and not Loras. Show viewers who LOVE Tyrion are going to crucify her for not jumping into his arms because he's not handsome enough. Going to be rough for poor Sophie Turner.Not necessarily. It will depend on how it's written. Granted, TV is a very visual medium, and certain realities about the actors involved are not going to be helpful.TV Tyrion's good looks and dainty little scar are probably the first problem. Someone did a mockup of a 3x03 still of TV Tyrion with Photoshop or something to show TV Tyrion with his book injuries, missing nose and all, and dayum, if the TV show had gone that route (even though I understand why the show didn't and can't blame them for not going in that direction), I don't think anyone anywhere would blame Sansa for not leaping into Tyrion's arms because of his looks. As it is, though, that's just not the case on the show. In addition to TV Tyrion being less attractive, it would also help if TV Loras were more attractive. Finn Jones is cute and all, but he's not exactly the Adonis Sansa describes; of the most attractive male actors who've been on the show, I don't know if he would make the top ten. Mileage varies on such things, but I find Peter Dinklage more attractive than Finn Jones, which I'm pretty sure is the opposite of how the comparison is supposed to play out. On top of that, in the books, Sansa is all of 12 as of ASOS and looks her age, conveying the fact that Sansa is a child and far, far too young for marriage of any kind, let alone a forced marriage, but in the show, Sansa is played by a 16-year-old actress who could never pass for 13 now, who could easily pass for 20 or older, and who towers over pretty much everyone who isn't the Hound. Visually, at least, a childlike waif she ain't. She's obviously still a teenager, but she doesn't look like a preteen; she looks like a young woman.

2608	Tirilei	2013-04-23	Sansa is going to get some serious backlash once she gets depressed that she's marrying Tyrion and not Loras. Show viewers who LOVE Tyrion are going to crucify her for not jumping into his arms because he's not handsome enough. Going to be rough for poor Sophie Turner.Don't think so.  Sansa is weak, but so sweet and kind and beautiful.  Who wouldn't wish her a young, handsome and loving knight of a husband?  Reading in this forum that she is going to be forced to marry Tyrion sounds just awful.  He may be smart and likeable in his own way, but he is a horny, whoring, middle-aged guy with a snotty sarcasm and a jealous girlfriend, not the shiny strong knight who should carry the young bride away. I'm betting on viewers to see it like that.
2609	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2013-04-24	I think Loras is the plan. Rather than include Willas, the writers have decided to take a shortcut and just use Loras instead. Which makes Sansa's situation only worse when she finds out she has to marry the Imp instead of the Knight of Flowers. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />
2610	Lord Varys	2013-04-24	On homosexuality as being 'effeminate' or why an openly gay Lord/King could get a political problem:
Of course, Loras is not an effeminate gay man, but it would be very easy for Lady Sansa of Highgarden to make her husband, the Lord Loras of Highgarden appear less than a real man in the eyes of the public and his bannermen. The show actually hinted at the problems the court of 'King Renly' would have faced if Renly had won the Iron Throne. You are in danger to be turned into a joke as man and king if you fail to consummate your marriage, or if you choose not to visit her bedchamber on a regular basis. In the books, Stannis and King Aerys I are ridiculed for this kind of behavior, and if you have a very outgoing and social wife - like, say, Margaery Tyrell - it is inevitable that doubts and rumors about the heritage of Margaery's children come up if she should ever give birth to any children. This could lead to the sort of problem King Daeron II. Targaryen faced during his reign, i.e. doubts about his heritage and subsequently the Blackfyre Rebellion. And King Renly, who would have had to claim the Iron Throne over the corpses of his own brothers and nephew/nieces, would never have the advantage of being considered the 'rightful king' in the first place. Claims that Renly's children are not his children could have been used easily to undermine his rule entirely, especially if Cersei's children or Shireen would still be alive in such a scenario.
Lord Loras of Highgarden would face a similar challenge, especially if his wife would grow into a woman who knows how to play her cards in the game. A gay monarch/lord needs to be very close to his wife, he has to trust her completely, else he has to fear that she or his enemies try to use the fact that he is not actually married to her against him. And even if that's not the case, a marriage that is not actually consummated (or where the parties are actually in love with other women/men) may very easily result in the disgrace of the woman in question. Both Margaery and Sansa as wives to gay lords/kings would be very tempted to start affairs with other men who actually care about them. We see the results of the mere rumors of such affairs in AFfC and ADwD.

2611	Woman of War	2013-04-24	I guess Loras would be able do do his marital duty from time to time until there is a heir and a spare and Sansa would dutifully open her legs. Neither Sansa nor him would have much fun in it and in the books it seemed as if Loras would outright dislike Sansa and is only too polite to show it. So it would be a loveless marriage like many or most of all those arranged or forced marriages among noblity, both partners or better said  victims doing their "duty".Only Loras as man would be more free to live his emotional and sex life elsewhere and Sansa would be thoroughly cut off from any emotional support. I do not know if she would get spiteful and make ugly jokes about her husband's preferences. And since the Tyrell women do not think much of her (Olenna: interesting? Not particularly. But her claim is) Sansa would have a sad life as breeding vessel in Laura Ashley looks all around her. But the whole sad thing would be a storybook example how an arranged or forced marriage wrongs not only the woman but the man as well.And in Westeros or a timesetting like that there must have been quite a few gay men caught in a situation like that, not to speak of lesbian women.Lord Loras of Highgarden would face a similar challenge, especially if his wife would grow into a woman who knows how to play her cards in the game. A gay monarch/lord needs to be very close to his wife, he has to trust her completely, else he has to fear that she or his enemies try to use the fact that he is not actually married to her against him.

We see the results of the mere rumors of such affairs in AFfC and ADwD.indeed Close friendship and a lot of trust would be their only chance of keeping upright their dignity. But this is the last thing Sansa expects from a marriage. She wants the all inclusive romance package and Loras seems not to think much of her. So dull sadness would await Sansa even more than Loras.

2612	Frey Pie a la Mode	2013-04-24	TV!Loras is so much more petulant and immature than book!Loras IMO /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />. I've found it so disappointing that he has complained and made faces and acted openly hostile about people talking about Renly in any negative manner. He thinks with his face, and this was not the Loras from the books, who was much more composed and understood how to play the game. In the TV scene after the Blackwater in the throne room, in which he asks Joffrey to marry Margaery, he acts very reluctant and unconvincing. Where's the smooth Knight of Flowers?
2613	Woman of War	2013-04-24	Yes, Loras and Margaery are supposed to be not only siblings but close friends and allies, only TV Margaery is twice as clever and interesting as Loras.
2614	Lord Varys	2013-04-24	Book Loras is no player of the game. Or at least a very clumsy player at best. Even if we were to assume that Loras fed Renly the idea to swap Cersei for Margaery as Robert's queen - and we know too little about Renly, so it could have easily been an idea born from the fact that Renly disliked both Cersei and Joffrey - it is actually quite obvious that this whole idea came from Mace Tyrell. He is the one who wants to make his daughter queen, after all. It was most likely also Mace who sent Loras to Storm's End to squire for Renly. Loras is a hothead - he volunteers to take Dragonstone for King Tommen, and almost gets himself killed - and not very bright - remember when he tells Jaime that he and Renly mostly looked at the pictures in Westerosi porn books?
TV Loras seems to be somewhat more ambitious when he feeds Renly the idea that he would be the best king, but we don't yet know if that was his very own idea, or merely Loras expressing the collective Tyrell ambition. Loras could not offer Renly his father's support and money in coming war for the Iron Throne if Mace Tyrell was not inclined to do this...
Whether both TV or book Loras would actually consummate a marriage remains doubtful in my opinion. In the books, Olenna indicates that it would been very hard to find a bride for Loras - despite his fame as Knight of Flowers. And to conceive a child in a medieval setting you may actually try more than once or twice in a year. And not every pregnancy is going to result in the birth of a healthy child. I don't see Loras being able to continue to have sex with Sansa, say, after one or two years of their marriage.
2615	aedalia	2013-04-24	I think they've established in the show there are other Tyrells out there (Margaery's conversation about her cousin), so it's ok if Loras becomes part of the KG.
2616	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-24	Don't think so.  Sansa is weak, but so sweet and kind and beautiful.  Beautiful, yes.  But sweet and kind?  I think you might have some disagreement on that.To me, book Sansa and HBO Sansa still come off as pretty self-centered.  She's just thrilled to be marrying into the family that is allied with the Lannisters, who killed her father, ran off her sister, and are trying to kill her brother.  Now, her age and lack of malevolence mean that she's miles better than the various nasties, but I don't think her self-centeredness and naivete are universally endearing.
2617	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-24	I don't see Loras being able to continue to have sex with Sansa, say, after one or two years of their marriage.There are plenty of men in the RL who come out of the closet with wife and kids, so if they can do it, why couldn't Loras?  And I think the problem with marrying off Loras is that, presumably, they'd want a woman with enough discretion to not make his homosexuality an issue.
2618	Minsc	2013-04-24	Beautiful, yes.  But sweet and kind?  I think you might have some disagreement on that.To me, book Sansa and HBO Sansa still come off as pretty self-centered.

Now, her age and lack of malevolence mean that she's miles better than the various nasties, but I don't think her self-centeredness and naivete are universally endearing.It is self-centered to be happy that you are going to be married and taken away from an increasingly hostile environment?  Especially, one where not only are you under constant threat of physical abuse but of actually being raped?  How the hell is that self-centered at all?Seriously, is Robb a self-centered brat because he refuses to make peace with the Lannisters in order to get his sister back?  Knowing quite well that they might be facing increasingly physical hardship and suffering because of his military campaign of trying to make himself king.

Sansa was pretty mean to Arya (yes, I know she was a child, but she never had a kind word for her little sister) and seems pretty focused on her own fate. Even with all the knocks she takes, is there a single other person she truly empathizes with? She's helpful with Sweet Robin, but only because she has to be. It's all an act, and she'd really like to smack him (not that he doesn't deserve it, but still!).

2621	athousandeyesand1	2013-04-24	My thoughts as well. Viewers already know how Sansa justloves the Knight of Flowers so it'll be better for viewers to see her reaction when she has to marry Tyrion. Although I am sort of a purist so I wish they would have mentioned Willas they don't have to cast him just mention him. Also I cant exactly remember at what point Loras becomes Kings Guard in ASOS isn't he already a member of the Kings Guard?
2622	AliKat	2013-04-24	I'm still waiting for a scene where Sansa expresses grief for her brothers, or when someone in King's Landing talks about what happened. Maybe it'll come after the Red Wedding (it has to come after the Red Wedding), or Tywin will bring it up next episode? After all, from what I've seen from the preview, they'll tell Tyrion to marry Sansa. What good would that be if Bran and Rickon were still alive?There is a scene from alot of the promos that has Tyrion, Tywin, and maybe others in a room with Joffrey and he yells 'I am the king, everyone is mine to torment' which makes me think that he's talking about Sansa and tormenting her about the RW and/or her little brothers.One thing that GRRM really glazed over and it bothers me was showing the reactions of the Stark kids to the deaths and the RW. He writes about Stannis mentioning to Jon about the RW but never show his reaction to the deaths of all of his brothers. Bran saw through Summer about Grey WInd/Robb but does he know about his mother? Does he know about Lady Stoneheart? Are his visions limited to the Stark kids that still have their wolves (Jon, Robb, Rickon) but if so - how did he knows about his father?  The show seemed to be setting up Rickon with some type of sixth sense in Season 1 when he told Bran that no one was coming back when Robb left then he knew about Ned. But then they kind of dropped that storyline. And so far in Season 3 - he hasn't spoken lol We saw him once but he didn't speak.Anyway - I love the show, I love the books but I think reading the books sets up too many expectations for the show. Its an incredible show and stands well on its own. But if you compare the two, it does get frustrating which makes me wish I had read the books after each season.
2623	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-24	It is self-centered to be happy that you are going to be married and taken away from an increasingly hostile environment? You mean absent other factors?  Or are we still considering that her future in-laws are allied to the people who have killed/are trying to kill, more members of her family?  Yes, it is self-centered as hell.Seriously, is Robb a self-centered brat because he refuses to make peace with the Lannisters in order to get his sister back?  Knowing quite well that they might be facing increasingly physical hardship and suffering because of his military campaign of trying to make himself king.No.  Lots of people have been murdered and faced hardship much worse than what his sister has gone through.  OTOH, Catelyn, who I do really like, was nevertheless incredibly self-centered when she released Jaime just to get her own girls back, and to hell with everyone else who has lost people in the war.
2624	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-24	I agree completely. Sansa was pretty mean to Arya (yes, I know she was a child, but she never had a kind word for her little sister) and seems pretty focused on her own fate. Even with all the knocks she takes, is there a single other person she truly empathizes with? She's helpful with Sweet Robin, but only because she has to be. It's all an act, and she'd really like to smack him (not that he doesn't deserve it, but still!).People have all sorts of opinions about Sansa -- I've personally never understood the folks who have latched onto how she is perceived by others as some kind of cause, but everyone is entitled to their opinion.  My point was that assuming that viewers in general would automatically sympathize with her is wrong -- there clearly are significant numbers of people, readers and viewers alike, who do not have a favorable view of her character, which the actress herself has acknowledged.
2625	Kasporio	2013-04-24	IMHO the showrunners screwed it. In the books it made sense. Loras joined the KG to protect his sis from a well known sadistic, retard husband, and also because, besides being a third son, he's (unknown to most) not interested in women. Tyrell's heir was never introduced in the books, it could have been so in the tv.
In the show, almost every people in westeros is aware of loras "secret", even average troopers. Oddly, no one in the court besides LF and Jaime seems to be aware of.
UNLIKELY.
Secondly, Margaery asking Sansa to marry Loras seems a cruel joke to the latter, and to Loras.
And LF, who is a master deceiver in the books, is easily spotted by Varys. So even a retard like Cersei would be soon aware of his plot to smuggle sansa out of KL.
They just screwed the most interesting part in the books. 
As said in earlier posts, the books could lead a reader to expect too much from the show, that's ok, the show couldn't as long or complicated. But i'm not fond of too much major changes in the plot. For example, im fond of the walking dead comics, and i found the tv was almost utterly different, not only in the plot, but in characters psychology too.
2626	Queen Regent	2013-04-24	I think Loras is the plan. Rather than include Willas, the writers have decided to take a shortcut and just use Loras instead. Which makes Sansa's situation only worse when she finds out she has to marry the Imp instead of the Knight of Flowers.that's what I was thinking.  I kept waiting for TQoT to mention Willas, but when Loras came up, it made more sense for the show.  Why introduce yet another character, when it's already been established that Sansa likes Loras/finds him attractive.
2627	Newstar	2013-04-24	Tyrell's heir was never introduced in the books, it could have been so in the tv.Yes, because that's precisely what the adaptation needs: more characters on screen. In the books, Willas hasn't even appeared in a POV chapter yet. We've heard all about him, but we've never "met" him, and we may never "meet" him. From a book perspective, he is basically a non-entity. I don't get all the clamour from fans to have a character introduced who hasn't even properly appeared in the books yet except secondhand, unless they're just bitter Willas/Sansa shippers.

In the beginning, she is a typical teenager who has a crush on a young royal who looks handsome to her, but without digging deeper to notice his personality. She is the well behaved, softer, more "girly type" and her tomboy little sister plays pranks on her (shoots food at her).  Yes, she is also a bit shallow and not the type who speaks up and tells her mind. Impatient, wants to get married right away and not have to wait.   Later she is the typical abuse victim, the battered girl who can't stand up to her abuser. She also has some "Queen Antoinette moments" when she wonders why the common people in the streets attacked her.  But she still comes across as sweet and friendly, just sheltered from the world and at the same time abused and oppressed.It would be interesting to see the character grow and mature and find a better life with honest and decent people.  The problem is just that the story doesn't offer many such people.

2629	Dove	2013-04-24	Sansa is quite kind - just look at S2, when she helped Ser Dontos. She saved a hapless man from a terrible death, even though her own position in King's Landing was so precarious at the time it was likely to get her in even more trouble than before. Even at this point in the show she's still rather naive, but she's never lacked in compassion or kindness.

It was just something for the readers to make them think she had a possible happy ending in sight.  The only difference with the show is that the writers decided to use a known character for said plot device instead of mentioning some new character. The end result will be the same.  Sansa dreaming of her knight in shining armor only to be forced to marry Tyrion against her will.Also, the fact that Loras is gay makes it even better for the show.   It shows the viewers that the roses are players in this game of thrones as well.   Something that was only indicated with the books due to none of them ever narrating any of the chapters.

The path there is a little bit strange though, since EVERYONE knows Loras is gay, versus in the books, where it was a better-kept secret
2633	Newstar	2013-04-25	EVERYONE knows Loras is gayEveryone except Sansa, that is. Womp womp!I agree this makes Sansa look even dumber, if everyone knows except her, but it should be interesting if Tywin intends to marry Cersei to Loras, if Loras' inclinations are brought up.
2634	Versiroth	2013-04-25	Sansa always comes off as naive anyway this early on in the story.  So, at least this change still fits her character.
2635	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-25	Sansa is quite kind - just look at S2, when she helped Ser Dontos.

Even at this point in the show she's still rather naive, but she's never lacked in compassion or kindness.Few people are lacking completely in kindness, so it's really a relative quality.  You may find what she did for Dontos sufficient to consider her kind overall, others may not.  I found her kindness to be far more the exception than the rule, right from the beginnings of AGOT.So you must also consider Arya a self-centered brat as she used Jaqen's deaths on individuals to protect herself or that she didn't like, instead of just naming Tywin, Joffrey, and Cersei thus winning the war without any need for a battle.No, I don't.  She's younger than Sansa, less mature, and was in much more immediate danger than Sansa was.  And even so, she ended up realizing and regretting her mistake.   But still, she used one death on the Tickler, who was torturing other people, and one to escape.  Also, each night, she lay in bed and recited the names of bad people who had done her family wrong.  When she openly confronted Joffrey about Mycah, Sansa lied even though it meant an innocent boy would get punished.  Saving Dontos was nice, but Mycah is still dead.Neither of them are angels, and neither are devils.  But to me, Sansa was generally a self-centered brat.  The brattiness went away after Ned was killed, so that's an improvement.

2636	White Harbors Wrath	2013-04-25	That is true. The end result will most likely be the same, so it doesn't matter. The path there is a little bit strange though, since EVERYONE knows Loras is gay, versus in the books, where it was a better-kept secretEveryone knew Renly was gay, but half of Westeros rallied to him behind his marriage to Margery...
2637	'96Buck	2013-04-25	I think we're missing the intentions of the Tyrells and Lannisters regarding power.Both know that Sansa is the key to the North (as Varys mentions in this episode), so having her at Highgarden would be preferable to the Tyrells.Loras is not yet a member of the Kingsguard, in the books he is only just recently a sworn knight of the Kingsguard before Jamie returns. This means there is an opening for him to marry Sansa. We've seen previously that Margaery and Mace Tyrell had direct plans for Margaery as Queen (whoever her partner King may have been). Having the same intentions for powerful positions through Loras seems to be legitimate. Also, Sansa would never dismiss an offer like that.Unfortunately, Tywin catches wind of the scheme and counters the proposition with the immediate marriage to Tyrion. The scene between Tyrion and Tywin in Episode 2 hinted at a "use" for Tyrion, which book readers know the outcome is their marriage.Tywin basically then reserves the Stark/North legacy for the Lannisters. He does this by having Cersei request him to join the KG, to which Loras cannot decline. Essentially it does give Loras a 'fly on the wall' position for small council meetings and royal secrets etc, which is why he takes the position tooLoras is the vessel for Sansa's title to the Tyrell's.Yep, Twyin is going to "steal" Mace's heir (Loras, it appears, in this case) and upset the Tyrell plot to seize title to the North by "whitecloaking" Loras, essentially the same way the Mad King did by whitecloaking Jamie.  That way, it pulls the rug out from under Sansa EVEN MORE than just ruining the Willias marriage did, to reinforce the "Tywin is ruthless" angle.It's a way to reduce the cast of characters/complexity, while bringing in the link more strongly to the past. Also, Sansa's chracter development to be willing to try to love Willias, and grow up a little bit out of the world-is-a-song view, that will now be missing would have been hard to pull off satisfyingly on screen, IMO.  She's have to be musing about it in a long scene with Shae that would not be very entertaining, IMO.She's still going to be very much the "little bird" through the PW.
2638	jugdesh258	2013-04-25	Loras being gay would not have kept him from performing his husbandly duties on occasion.  It would be expected of him as a Lord.....everyone is closeted if you are of noble birth.  Business before pleasure.  Probably have as good a marriage as anyone after the honeymoon is over.
He told Renly what he had to do with his new wife so he ought not be a hypocrite in this scenario.....although that dialogue did not occur in the book we can make that leap in the story since he backed the joining of houses and need for an heir.
As mentioned they could have used Willas.....The Load Oaf, his father,  never got a seat on the council so they never brought up the kings guard position either.  Someone has likely surmised that his sudden appointment is going to be half the solution to foil the Tyrell plan.  When Tyrion gets swapped in that is when Olenna will give Sansa the hairnet
2639	Minsc	2013-04-25	No, I don't.  She's younger than Sansa, less mature, and was in much more immediate danger than Sansa was.  And even so, she ended up realizing and regretting her mistake.   But still, she used one death on the Tickler, who was torturing other people, and one to escape.  Also, each night, she lay in bed and recited the names of bad people who had done her family wrong.  When she openly confronted Joffrey about Mycah, Sansa lied even though it meant an innocent boy would get punished.  Saving Dontos was nice, but Mycah is still dead.Neither of them are angels, and neither are devils.  But to me, Sansa was generally a self-centered brat.  The brattiness went away after Ned was killed, so that's an improvement.So you are willing to make excuse for Arya letting go the complete possibility of ending the war and saving her entire family, because she was sacred of Wease and that she wanted to escape.  Yet, Sansa is self-centered because she is willing to go somewhere where she is not threatened with physical beating and rape because these people are marrying Joffey (besides that they haven't done anything to her family).  Seeing how in actuality both where in equal amount of danger.Why is Arya's safety more important then Sansa's safety?Moreover, who cares if Arya still wishes death on the people who did her family wrong,  She had the opportunity to bring down righteous vengeance on them, but instead thinking of only herself she named a number of random thugs and then used her magical deaths to rescue herself.  Her regretting this only proves that she realizes that her actions were completely self-centered.    Myach was dead before Sansa even spoke to King Robert, and he would have been killed by Cersei no matter what.  Additionally, even Ned Stark told how Sansa's duty required her not to go against her betrothal thus why Sansa went with a completely neutral answer.  Moreover, it was Arya's "defense" of him that actually got Myach killed as otherwise Joffrey wouldn't have lied about them beating him.  So at least when Sansa is defending an innocent she doesn't do it a way that ends with said individual's death.
2640	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-25	So you are willing to make excuse for Arya letting go the complete possibility of ending the war and saving her entire family, because she was sacred of Wease and that she wanted to escape. Yes.  Even if their conduct was the same, which I don't think it was, I cut younger kids more slack than older ones.  Arya made an error in judgment that was based on her trying to survive and/or anger at seeing bad people mistreat others.Yet, Sansa is self-centered because she is willing to go somewhere where she is not threatened with physical beating and rape because these people are marrying Joffey (besides that they haven't done anything to her family).  Seeing how in actuality both where in equal amount of danger.No, that's not why Sansa is self-centered compared to Arya.  Sansa is self-centered because she rarely spares a thought for her family, or for anyone but herself.  She plays immature little fantasy games in her head, and when the possibility arises that she might marry ~Loras!~ the storybook knight, she's just giddy because it's all going to work out so well for her, and she'll be in this wonderful new family, and she'll have just the bestest BFF sister-in-law in the whole wide world!  Which is pretty much been her pattern since Winterfell.Meanwhile, her new family will be helping to kill her old one.  Yup, that Sansa's not self-centered.....

Additionally, she doesn't only think about herself as she prays and cares for Sandor, Tyrion, Dontas, Tommen, Margaery, the soldiers of Blackwater, and the poor of King's Landing.It is absolutely ridiculous to argue that it some type of self-centeredness for a young girl to accept an offer that protects her from physical harm and potential rape.  Quite frankly, I doubt that either Catelyn or Robb would have been angry if she married Willas understanding that will work to protect her from the Lannisters.
2642	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-25	Sansa directly thinks about how if she thinks to much about her family that it causes to much emotional hurt, thus she focuses her attention on surviving and other escapisms........You think this is a good excuse.  I don't.  And I think there are a lot of readers and viewers who share that POV.  You don't think it hurts Catelyn to think about her family?  Doesn't hurt Robb, Jon, Arya, Bran, or Rickon?  They're not out partying with new friends.  But Sansa?  "Well, thinking about my family is just too painful, so instead, I'll just think about that dreamy Loras!, and just forget that his family is helping to butcher mine."It is absolutely ridiculous to argue that it some type of self-centeredness for a young girl to accept an offer that protects her from physical harm and potential rape.Just because you say it does not make it so.  And, the kicker is that it's not her just accepting an offer of protection so she doesn't get raped.  It's being joyful at marrying into the Tyrells for it's own sake.  She gets to be with her BFF Margaery, don't you know!

"Well, thinking about my family is just too painful, so instead, I'll just think about that dreamy Loras!, and just forget that his family is helping to butcher mine.Good thing is almost never does that besides the few minutes that she comes into contact with him, other then those few minutes she is only thinking about how to survive. Seriously, that is like arguing that Tyrion doesn't care for Jaime as he does spend every POV worrying about his brother.Just because you say it does not make it so.  And, the kicker is that it's not her just accepting an offer of protection so she doesn't get raped.  It's being joyful at marrying into the Tyrells for it's own sake.  She gets to be with her BFF Margaery, don't you know!She is joyful because it will mean that she is better protected and away from King's Landing.  Quite frankly, her marrying Willas would have strengthen Robb's efforts as now he no longer has to worrying about how the Lannisters might use his sister as leverage to keep him at bay.  In how, the Tyrells won't allow their heir's wife be abused or murdered just because Tywin wants to send a message to Robb.
2644	Dove	2013-04-25	It's a little strange how you go out of your way to make a ton of excuses for one small frightened girl but not the other small frightened girl, to the point of even villainizing her as a "self-centered brat" because she wants to get away from an intensely dangerous situation and sees the by all accounts warm, friendly, clever Margaery as a potential friend.
2645	Head of The Ned	2013-04-26	omg they screwed this storyline up so much! where is willas! loras is gay and he is a kingsguard! it makes no sense! ahhhhh it is character assassination once again!
seriously though, I wonder how it is that the Lannisters find out? I guess they just have that many spies.
2646	Dove	2013-04-26	Well, in the books Sansa spilled the beans to Dontos, who told Baelish, who told the Lannisters, right?
I'm thinking LF might invite Sansa on his trip to woo Lysa (he booked two beds, remember), she declines and mentions the marriage/gives some kind of hint, and it proceeds as it did before.
2647	Razha	2013-04-26	What if Sansa confides to Shae, Shae tells Tyrion, and it's Tyrion who informs his dad about Sasna/Loras plans?
2648	Woman of War	2013-04-26	And? What if?
There might hang a little bird in a palm tree, disguised as monkey........really, who tells what to whom about whichever marriage plan we will see in a few days, pointless to waste bits and bytes about it.
But what really disturbs me is that people, when deploring Sansa's loss of potential happiness with Willas, conveniently forget  that, no matter whom she married she would still have been a child too young for sex. So if Willas had consummated the marriage he would have been a child abuser, just like anyone who fucks a twelve year old, married or not. And given the political situation Willas would have had to "consummate" the marriage straightaway, the thing Tyrion refused to do. Why excuse Willas  as potential path to happiness for Sansa?

2649	Versiroth	2013-04-26	omg they screwed this storyline up so much! where is willas! loras is gay and he is a kingsguard! it makes no sense! ahhhhh it is character assassination once again!seriously though, I wonder how it is that the Lannisters find out? I guess they just have that many spies.Loras is NOT openly gay.   He and Renly had a secret affair.  Sure, some people know about it, but it's not public knowledge.  Also, as others mentioned, Renly was also gay and he was married to Margery for political reasons.   If Margery is willing to marry a man that is in love with her brother for political reasons, you think it's beyond the realm of possibility that she'd be willing to marry off her brother under the same circumstances?   Sexual preference doesn't have anything to do with anything.   We're talking about a world where young 13 year old girls are married off to 60+ year old men for political gain.   Heck, MOST highborn marriages are arranged in Westeros.  So no, there is no character assassination here.    The change fits into this world like a glove.Also, for the person saying that Sansa is selfish... what is she supposed to do?   She's basically a prisoner of the Lannisters.  Not only that, but she's already seen how quickly someone can lose there head if Joffrey has a whim.  Should she just demand them to kill her so she's not seen as being selfish?   She is basically in all out survival mode and the Tyrels offering her an out is like Jamie excepting Catelyn's offer in exchange for freedom.  There's absolutely nothing selfish about self preservation.  It's instinct to do what you must to survive.
2650	Versiroth	2013-04-26	And? What if?There might hang a little bird in a palm tree, disguised as monkey........really, who tells what to whom about whichever marriage plan we will see in a few days, pointless to waste bits and bytes about it.But what really disturbs me is that people, when deploring Sansa's loss of potential happiness with Willas, conveniently forget  that, no matter whom she married she would still have been a child too young for sex.

And given the political situation Willas would have had to "consummate" the marriage straightaway, the thing Tyrion refused to do. Why excuse Willas  as potential path to happiness for Sansa?In Westeros, Sansa is considered a women, not a child.   It's the reason she freaked out when she had her first period.  It marked the moment when she is ready for marriage and consummation.  And as I said earlier, it's not uncommon for a girl flowered to be offered up to old men for arranged marriages.   Westeros isn't America.  It is it's own world with it's own rules.	Also, Tyrion didn't refuse Sansa due to her age.   He felt bad for her and told her they could wait.  If Sansa wouldn't have looked so terrified, Tyrion would have had her without a second thought.EDIT: Also, in the book, Dany was only 13 when she was married to Drogo.

Why excuse Willas  as potential path to happiness for Sansa?Well, for me a big difference is that Sansa had made a choice in her own mind to accept the Willas match as opposed to being forced into one with Tyrion.  Her decision to make Willas love her was quite a mature one and a sign that she is growing.  Also, I don't think its a given that Willas would have consummated the marriage right away.  It's possible sure but we don't know for certain.  Look at Margaery for example.  She never consummated her marriage to Tommen because he was still so young.  So, I don't think it's a given that the consummation would have been right away.  Also, a Willas Sansa marriage could not have happened for at least a few more months until after the purple wedding so Sansa would have been just a little bit older. Also, I agree with what Versiroth said above about Sansa being in survival mode and just wanting to get away from Joffrey as soon as possible.

Which is like why so many viewers (and readers) dislike Sansa.  Arya doesn't require people to constantly defend her because she just isn't disliked on the same scale. Good thing is almost never does that besides the few minutes that she comes into contact with him, other then those few minutes she is only thinking about how to survive. Seriously, that is like arguing that Tyrion doesn't care for Jaime as he does spend every POV worrying about his brother.No, it's not. Tyrion isn't actively consorting with the people who are trying to kill his brother and ruin his family.  And, his brother is a valuable hostage, so the risk of him getting killed is comparatively small.  Sansa is thrilled at marrying the heir to the family that is trying to defeat hers.  She doesn't know if her younger brothers or sister are alive, and knows that the Lannister/Tyrell alliance is doing their best to kill her older brother as a traitor.  Not to mention her father being murdered, and her new bestest friends allied themselves to his killers.She is joyful because it will mean that she is better protected and away from King's Landing.  Quite frankly, her marrying Willas would have strengthen Robb's efforts as now he no longer has to worrying about how the Lannisters might use his sister as leverage to keep him at bay.  In how, the Tyrells won't allow their heir's wife be abused or murdered just because Tywin wants to send a message to Robb.And because she's marrying dreamy Loras, as well as getting Margaery as her BFF.  In any case, there remains the fact of how little she actually thinks/worries about the rest of her family, which doesn't bother you but bothers me.  Neither side is going to convince the other, and its been that way since the books came out.Maybe we can at least agree to thank the showrunners for not touching upon the ridiculous San/San shipping, though.

Such as saying Arya is mainly concerned about her own survival that must means she is self-centered, instead most realize she is a young girl just trying to survive in a hostile environment thus of course she doesn't think of her family first all the time.  In contrast, we have you arguing that Sansa should deny any protections that might stop her from being physically abused and raped because that means she is only caring about her own safety.  Because somehow it is selfish for a young girl to not to agree with bearing a couple of beatings and rapes in order to demonstrate the solidarity for the home team (well unless it relates to wasting magical deaths that could automatically win the war for your side if used correctly.)  And because she's marrying dreamy Loras, as well as getting Margaery as her BFF.  In any case, there remains the fact of how little she actually thinks/worries about the rest of her family, which doesn't bother you but bothers me.  Neither side is going to convince the other, and its been that way since the books came out.Funny how she is not marrying the dreamy Loras, but instead she marrying the older, plain, crippled, and possibly fat Willas (besides in this lame adaptation). Moreover, we see Sansa actually praying for her family all throughout the books thus showing her concern for them.  In contrast, Arya only prays for her own personal vengeance. Finally, the only way she thinks more about her family is how we Arya whining about how unfair it was that her mother would praise Sansa for being good at things while she received minor criticisms regarding skills she was terrible at.  Thus, not the most unselfish thinking of her family that you are describing.
2654	Versiroth	2013-04-26	@	Former Lord of WinterfellI think you're being extremely unreasonable.   Sansa hates the Lannisters for what they've done to her family and given her situation while being held at Kings Landing, there is absolutely nothing wrong with befriending Margery (someone who had no direct fault in anything that happened to her or her family) and hoping for freedom and happiness by marring a highborn lord far away from the place that has become a waking nightmare for her.   I don't really like Sansa all that much either, but you really are being unreasonable.   It's not like she has much choice over anything she does.   It's either stay at King's Landing and continue to be Joffrey's play thing or go off and attempt to find some happiness at Highgarden.

And the Tyrells wanted the claim, not he person Sansa, they did not give a crap if Sansa would have liked Willas or might find him disgusting. Sansa lives in a fantasy here, she shapes her own little Willas fantasy out of thin air, she had never met Willas, she thought about romantics, flowers and puppies but what she would have got is to fuck with a much older man, who might be rude and disgusting or not.
2656	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-26	Yes. because with Arya fans don't nitpick on stupid points.First, it's not a case of their being "Arya fans".  It's a case of their being so few Arya detractors compared to Sansa.Second, your reasoning is circular.

Somehow, though, I don't think she'll see it that way.Funny how she is not marrying the dreamy Loras, but instead she marrying the older, plain, crippled, and possibly fat Willas (besides in this lame adaptation).Isn't this the "lame adaptation" sub-forum, though? My initial comment was in response to how someone thought viewers would react to Sansa when she learns she's going to marry Tyrion.

It's either stay at King's Landing and continue to be Joffrey's play thing or go off and attempt to find some happiness at Highgarden.This.Also, there is absolutely no way Sansa could help anyone in her family by staying in King's Landing. If she goes to Highgarden and marries a Tyrell son, she stands a better chance of gaining some level of influence which she could potentially wield on behalf of her brother. Notice that I'm not saying she would be able to do that - but her chances of being able to do anything at all are better in Highgarden as a member of the Tyrell family, than in King's Landing as a hostage and whipping girl.You know, aside from the whole "not being regularly beaten and potentially raped" thing.Which do you think Ned and Cat would prefer for their daughter - imprisonment by the Lannisters, or marriage to the Tyrells? With her safely out of KL, Robb and Cat could focus on the war without constantly worrying about what would be done to Sansa in retaliation.This marriage is definitely by far the better of the two options available to Sansa at that time.

Someone posted upthread that the audience might not like Sansa if she is nasty to/rejects Tyrion.   Someone else then said (paraphrasing) no, they think everyone will understand that because viewers like her.  I'm simply pointing out that a lot of folks don't like her, and why.  It's not that she's a horrible person, or evil.  It's just that for a lot of folks, there isn't a whole lot there to admire affirmatively.  I don't think that's unreasonable, but obviously, opinions differ.It's not like she has much choice over anything she does.   It's either stay at King's Landing and continue to be Joffrey's play thing or go off and attempt to find some happiness at Highgarden.I'd agree that she doesn't have a lot of choice as to her fate.

I think your biggest argument flaw is that you some how believe it's selfish for Sansa to attempt to find some form of happiness.   Which is ridiculous.  Just because people that she loves have died or are at war, doesn't mean she doesn't have the right to attempt to make a happy life for herself.   Especially when the alternative to her marrying a Tyrell seems to be becoming one of Joffrey's drunken playthings.

2660	Elba the Intoner	2013-04-26	Woman of War I agree that the Tyrells are only interested in her claim but I can't be 100% sure of what would have happened because it never happened so we'll never know for sure.  Margaery also claims she never consummated her marriage to Renly and whether that's actually true or not it suggests that the Tyrells have no problems saying whatever they need to say to suit their political purposes.  Sansa added the fluffy part about the puppies and sailing down the river as a way to help her accept the idea of marriage to an unknown.  Yes that part of her thinking was still very girly and naive, but her willingness at least to accept an unknown Willas is a step up from the idealized view she had in AGOT.  But we won't even see that small progression now because it has been changed back to Loras who is known to her and is someone on whom she had a huge crush.
2661	Versiroth	2013-04-26	I'd agree that she doesn't have a lot of choice as to her fate.  It is her mindset, lack of concern for her family, fantasizing, etc.., that makes her annoying to some.Even in real life people that are in bad situations attempt to rationalize their situations in their own mind.   It's the way the human mind works.   Heck, it's the same reason Theon, once so proud and head strong eventually becomes Wreak.   It was the only way for him to survive what was happening to him.  In the books, Sansa quite often has thoughts that show she is completely behind her family.   She just has no power or influence to actually help them.  The one time she tried, Joffrey beheaded her father anyway.

I don't think Sansa is any worse than your average self-centered 13 year old girl.  But I wouldn't be wanting to read about them either.
2663	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-26	Yeah, because marrying the uncle of the man whom beheaded your father is every girls dream.  Yes, that's exactly it.  It's not her dream.  Couldn't have said it better myself.
2664	Versiroth	2013-04-26	It's Reek, not Wreak.Whether what Sansa does would be realistic in the RL is beside the point because we're not in the RL, but in a fantasy world with entertaining rather than ordinary people.  I don't think Sansa is any worse than your average self-centered 13 year old girl.  But I wouldn't be wanting to read about them either.No, it's not beside the point, it is the point.   The fact that you can relate to these characters is what makes them interesting to read.	Arguing that Sansa wanting to be happy makes her self-centered is ridiculous.   She is in a bad situation and her brain is trying to cope with it.  Honestly, what could she have done differently?

2665	Versiroth	2013-04-26	Yes, that's exactly it.  It's not her dream.  Couldn't have said it better myself.And in the book, neither is the cripple, Willas, yet you still claim that she's self-centered there too.
2666	Minsc	2013-04-26	Honestly, what could she have done differently?Accept a fate of being repeatedly beaten and raped, as only then she would be unselfish.Because having girlish dreams of being safe by marrying someone is the ultimate sign of being selfish.In contrast, killing one of your brother's own men as you don't feel safe is unselfish.In particular, if it is done after wasting the chance to actually kill your family's enemies because you felt unsafe and one of them told a mean story.
2667	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-04-26	But what really disturbs me is that people, when deploring Sansa's loss of potential happiness with Willas, conveniently forget  that, no matter whom she married she would still have been a child too young for sex. So if Willas had consummated the marriage he would have been a child abuser, just like anyone who fucks a twelve year old, married or not. And given the political situation Willas would have had to "consummate" the marriage straightaway, the thing Tyrion refused to do. Why excuse Willas  as potential path to happiness for Sansa?WoW, I know the concept of Sansa's marriage at such a tender age seems cruel but it does seem to be the norm for Westeros girls to be available for marriage once they've bled. And Sansa herself is not considering her youth as any sort of protection. When she's married Tyrion, no one character, not even her mother, complains of any impropriety regarding her age. They all complain about her marrying a Lannister and nothing else. I agree, though, I don't think Willas was the savior everyone thought he would be.Sansa added the fluffy part about the puppies and sailing down the river as a way to help her accept the idea of marriage to an unknown.  Yes that part of her thinking was still very girly and naive, but her willingness at least to accept an unknown Willas is a step up from the idealized view she had in AGOT.  But we won't even see that small progression now because it has been changed back to Loras who is known to her and is someone on whom she had a huge crush.Actually no, at this point in the story Sansa is still romanticizing things and while she has become aware that the Tyrells are interested in her claim, she fools herself to believe they will be better and she has nothing to base that on. After all, Joff and Cersei were all smiles and flattery when she first met them. With a smiling Margaery and the powerful matriarch Queen of the Tyrells, Sansa would have shown growth to be at least a bit wary. But she bought the dream hook, line and sinker but showed slight progress in accepting a crippled version of the knight of her songs. The minute she talks about puppies and starts naming her children it is the same thing as giving Joffrey pretty blond babies. It's not until Tyrion that Sansa starts to really pull her head out of her songs and fairytales.

That's been pretty much my point in this whole discussion.  I never said that was when she did a complete turnaround in her thinking with the Willas match.  But my point still stands that we won't see even that small bit of progress now.
2669	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-26	No, it's not beside the point, it is the point.   The fact that you can relate to these characters is what makes them interesting to read.Maybe for you, but I find that there are a great many characters whose worldview, personality, etc. are very different from mine, yet I still enjoy them as characters because they are not mundane.   i don't need to identify with a character to enjoy that character.Sansa is certainly a plausible equivalent of the junior high popular/cute girl who is part of a clique that makes fun of girls who are less attractive, like Arya Horseface.  But just because she is realistically drawn doesn't mean she is likeable or interesting.

Heck, she sold out her own father because she didn't want to leave King's Landing.  But, then he loses his head and she's continuously beaten, humiliated, toyed with, used, married off to Tyrion against her will, etc.    It sounds to me that your mind is stuck on the version of Sansa at the beginning of the journey instead of the one who's had to endure a lot of hardships.    I can't really blame you though...  I'm the same way with Jaime.  I could see that GRRM was trying to make his road one of redemption, but I could never buy into it.   To me, he'll always be that sick incestual prick that threw Bran out of a window.
2671	Kittykatknits	2013-04-26	Woman of War I agree that the Tyrells are only interested in her claim but I can't be 100% sure of what would have happened because it never happened so we'll never know for sure.  Margaery also claims she never consummated her marriage to Renly and whether that's actually true or not it suggests that the Tyrells have no problems saying whatever they need to say to suit their political purposes.  Sansa added the fluffy part about the puppies and sailing down the river as a way to help her accept the idea of marriage to an unknown.  Yes that part of her thinking was still very girly and naive, but her willingness at least to accept an unknown Willas is a step up from the idealized view she had in AGOT.  But we won't even see that small progression now because it has been changed back to Loras who is known to her and is someone on whom she had a huge crush.Sansa later reflects on her wedding night and makes clear that her big objection is the circumstances around it, that she would have felt very differently if it was with someone else and in other circumstances. Tyrion's problem wasn't his looks, it was his family. There is no reason why looks would become the deciding factor for Willas here either. So, yeah, I agree with you. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Accept a fate of being repeatedly beaten and raped, as only then she would be unselfish.Because having girlish dreams of being safe by marrying someone is the ultimate sign of being selfish.In contrast, killing one of your brother's own men as you don't feel safe is unselfish.In particular, if it is done after wasting the chance to actually kill your family's enemies because you felt unsafe and one of them told a mean story.I believe some elements of the fandom would also accept Sansa taking out Joffrey in a murder/suicide attempt as an alternate choice to show her unselfishness/loyalty to her family. Although, it is critical that she also die in the progress.

To me, they'd need the rest of their lives to atone for what they've done.  Pretty words and remorse aren't enough.Sansa isn't evil, and hasn't committed any horrible acts.  I certainly don't preclude the possibility of her maturing into a better young woman, perhaps even better than her sister.  That may even be more likely than not.  I just think that, so far, she really hasn't taken more than baby steps in that direction.Suffering may be the catalyst for character growth, but it is not character growth itself.  The key marker of growth for Sansa will be when she stops feeling sorry for herself.
2673	Lady Lu	2013-04-26	Accept a fate of being repeatedly beaten and raped, as only then she would be unselfish.Because having girlish dreams of being safe by marrying someone is the ultimate sign of being selfish.In contrast, killing one of your brother's own men as you don't feel safe is unselfish.In particular, if it is done after wasting the chance to actually kill your family's enemies because you felt unsafe and one of them told a mean story.What good would being beaten and raped do for her family or the North? I would say curling up in a ball of self-pity and accepting a miserable situation as self-punishment is a lot more selfish than changing your situation to one where you can possibly be useful.I think itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s important to remember that even Catelyn wished that her son could have brought home Margaery Tyrell if he wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t going to marry his Frey.  House Tyrell isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t allied with the Lannisters out of any great love for the Lannisters; remember that they were originally Team Robert Baratheon, which would have required him to remove Cersei in some fashion.  To reiterate what others have said, Sansa could do so much more for the North as Lady of Highgarden than she ever could as a prisoner in Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing, and if the Lannisters werenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t threatened by the possible implications of a Stark-Tyrell alliance, they wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have hurriedly married Sansa off to Tyrion.  Tywin certainly didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t arrange that match out of any great love for Tyrion.

I am only a little annoyed by the double standard: the character Tyrion is hated by some posters for even considering the idea of bedding Sansa while it would be totally ok if Willas did the same.And there is Cat promising Arya to some Frey. Would she have expected her daughter to dutifully open her legs for some guy forced upon her?I really like the character of Cat and I try to make excuses for her like "make a promise, win the war and we'll see" but if Cat had tried to force Arya (Arya would have fought for her identity) she would not have been better than Cersei or Tywin to Sansa. Only I close my eyes to that truth since I am determined to like Cat.

In how, any "consent" she gives is obviously based on her duress of how she fears that she will be punished otherwise.In contrast, with Willas she has at least given some consent and shown some willingness that she would want to be with him thus it is little less rapey.  Would I think it would be right for Willas to bed an obviously sacred minor?  No, but it still better then the Tyrion's situation as she made the choice to accept him without the fear that Mace Tyrell would physically beat her until she said yes.

Really struggling to see how the issue of consent is being missed here. In the case of Tyrion, she'd already been threatened by Cersei, threatened by Joffrey, groped by Joffrey, and got the line about smashing her portcullis from Tyrion that day while being taken to the sept under armed guard. Seems like anything that vaguely looks like consent is lacking here.Sansa was talked to and her consent was gained when it came to Willas. How is this even cause for confusion?
2677	Woman of War	2013-04-27	But Willas is Sansa's fantasy in a mental construct she forms to protect herself from harsh reality, this man does not exist, she has projected all her hopes there and has given consent to a fiction. Apart From that, in our world, even if a child agrees to sexual abuse, it is still just as much abuse. 
Sansa's hopes have nothing to do with the person Willas, nothing to do with sexual desire, how could they? They are a straw for survival. The reality would be someone who fucks her for her claim, she would find that out only a little later and the fall would be just as deep, or deeper since she would get fucked.

For example, I enjoy the Sansa/Sandor potential relationship however I still cannot say that I want to read about them doing the dirty until she is older and wiser(and he seriously works out his rage issues)However, while I still would consider it somewhat wrong for Willas (or later Sandor) to bed Sansa because of issues of her age and her sense of confusion about the situation there is still the benefit of a slight hint of consent by her in accepting/wanting him.  In contrast, there was none of that at all in regards to her experience with Tyrion and he knows that thus it feels more wrong as even that slight hint is not present.Don't get me wrong I don't hate Tyrion for his initial willingness to bed Sansa at most I find it creepy and disturbing, but I feel the same way about Drogo and Dany additionally I would likely feel slightly the same if we read about Willas coming at her in the same way (or later Sandor if she is still a confused child when it happens).The only thing I object to is either people attempting to make Tyrion a hero for not having sex with her or those who villianize her for not sleeping with him.  Other then that I just judge it to be a slightly creepy action by Tyrion but I am not going to argue that he should be executed for it.

2679	Woman of War	2013-04-27	There have been those wonderful Tyrion reread threads in the books reread section where all that had been discussed in a really great exchange. Now they are nearly over since they have reached the end of ADWD.
Bottom line for me: Loras is an illusion for happiness just as much as unknown Willas, introducing an unknown character who would stay wooden since people only talk about him, and words are wind. He could be a bluebeard character or Prince charming, to viewers he would be a non entity while Loras and Sansa fancying him are very much fleshed out. Apart from that, when it comes to the series, all talk of child abuse is obsolete anyways. Sansa having her first period only a few months ago is highly unbelievable if you see Sophie Turner who looks like twenty.

2680	Minsc	2013-04-27	There have been those wonderful Tyrion reread threads in the books reread section where all that had been discussed in a really great exchange. Now they are nearly over since they have reached the end of ADWD.I am still only on the beginning of those, but I am just stating my opinion on why I am slightly more comfortable with Willas rather then Tyrion.
2681	Woman of War	2013-04-27	I am still only on the beginning of those, but I am just stating my opinion on why I am slightly more comfortable with Willas rather then Tyrion.I am thoroughly uncomfortable with both of them in that situation since I am aware that forced or arranged marriages are still very much reality in our world, not only violating the young women but the young men as well, first of all gay men. And my admittedly pointed opinion is that defending arranged marriages as opposed to forced marriages means agreeing that the parents choose the rapist of their daughter, thus drawing the carpet of parental solidarity from under her feet by making common cause with her abuse.We with our "Western" values live on a peaceful island of the blessed compared to many parts of the world and the fate of women there.But that has not so much to do with the book or series situation of Sansa, Loras and Tyrion.
2682	SilentSense	2013-04-27	Yep. No mention of any other brother in the show, so Loras is it. Loras is not a member of the KG, yet. My guess Tywin will make him one in order to scuttle the marriage. Yeah. Quite ironic given that this is how he was deprived of his desired heir to Casterly Rock. Well done by the show writers.
2683	Sun	2013-04-27	But Willas is Sansa's fantasy in a mental construct she forms to protect herself from harsh reality, this man does not exist, she has projected all her hopes there and has given consent to a fiction.

In the case of Tyrion, she'd already been threatened by Cersei, threatened by Joffrey, groped by Joffrey, and got the line about smashing her portcullis from Tyrion that day while being taken to the sept under armed guard. Seems like anything that vaguely looks like consent is lacking here.Sansa was talked to and her consent was gained when it came to Willas. How is this even cause for confusion?possibly because even with consent, the situation for sansa is horrible. she gives consent to puppies and picnics again not understanding what she is really doing. however she does understand she has a claim that everyone is after.she gave consent to joffrey as well and look how that turned out. did her consent mean all is ok and fair now? Woman of War is correct in that consent seems to be a bit overblown here since arranged or forced, marriage can still be a nightmare. tyrion is a member of the family that has caused her family harm and destruction however, he is the only one who shows her the decency to give her time to come to understand what marriage really is. people say he shouldn't be considered a hero because he stopped but that was the point of the whole scene. that he was willing to do what society expected him to - even what sansa expected him to - but he didn't because he realized that sansa was still thinking of songs and fairytales. he told her he'd wait for her to come to him. it may never happen but i do not see willas saying that. not with the threat of the lannisters being so evident. i also don't see the queen of thorns allowing such folly. the tyrells were more united and knew what needed to be done to get the results they wanted. tyrion's discord with his family was a blessing for sansa's situation here. his stopping definitely put his family's plans for sansa in jeopardy.willas was a dream and safety from king's landing for sansa just as loras is. neither one will marry her so the switch is not extremely important. the only thing lost is that sansa shows she sees beyond beauty at this point which may possibly be shown on the show in another way.
2685	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-27	Doesn't all this just boil down to a generalized opposition to arranged marriages in Westeros?  Did Joffrey really have much more of a choice than did Sansa?  Ned, though an adult, was equally bound by custom to marry a woman he didn't really even know or want, and the same for Catelyn.
I don't get why this is such a big deal in the context of the books, or why it is any worse than lots of the other barbarism/lack of respect for individual rights in Westeros/medieval setting.  Arranged marriages - big deal.
2686	jons nissa	2013-04-27	i agree, men were just as forced as women when it comes to arranged marriages. however the argument is always made that men had it easier and they did. they had easier access to lovers and could hide bastards easier than a woman.
the argument is also made that tyrion had more choice than sansa as to whether or not to marry. i've seen really solid defense of both sides of this argument so i think it's hard to take a definite stand on this. that said, i believe tyrion was as forced to do this as sansa but i agree there were real rewards for tyrion as a result of the union while sansa gained nothing.
bringing this to the willas/loras proposal, again, there are real gains for the groom but sansa only gains a chance to leave king's landing, not that that's a small matter, but very unfair, all things considered, so it's really not much better for her. 
eta:
my last post was really addressing the issue of consent and it's importance and it's shortcomings.

2687	Rhaegarsjoy	2013-04-27	I think their parents can force them the first time around and since there is no such thing as deforce some found other ways to get their Revenge or any sort of happiness and not always the right way like cercei refused to have her husbands children, lysa kills her to be with the man she loved. Sansa maybe as she got older could have found a way to get rid of unwanted husband wether Tyrion or willas.
2688	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-04-27	The reality would be someone who fucks her for her claim, she would find that out only a little later and the fall would be just as deep, or deeper since she would get fucked.I agree he and the rest of the Tyrells only wanted her for her claim but I think she is aware of that. What she isn't aware of yet, and how could she be, is what it really means to be married. jons nissa is correct, it's puppies and picnics she's thinking of not consummation with a complete stranger, pregnancy and possibly dying in childbirth, finding commonality with that stranger or how life at Highgarden, although probably safer than King's Landing, might not be the song she would like it to be. Let's face it, she thinks the Tyrells are her friends until she is literally walking toward Tyrion to be married. She is just not aware of what lies ahead for her, regardless of who she marries.
2689	Tommen	2013-04-28	The one thing I didn't necessarily like about all that is the fact that Margaery is supposed to feel safe by Joff's side cause her bro is a KG, which I guess also doesn't matter in the show cause she's the puppeteerI think that's one of best changes they've made on the show, Margaery protecting herself with her own wits rather than relying on a man to reassure her. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />And I think tbh that Margaery thinks she's doing both Sansa and Loras a personal favour. Loras' son would be Lord of Winterfell and I don't think she's heartless enough to realise that Sansa desperate to escape Joffrey and Cersei. Even marrying a man who isn't sexually interested in her is surely preferable to being Joffrey's prisoner.
2690	Hound's She-wolf	2013-04-29	Why do people dislike Sansa for fantasizing and dreaming? She's a 12 year old girl stuck in hell! She has been beaten and stripped in front of the court and is still held hostage by the same people that killed her family. Of-course she's going to daydream and try to fantasize about a husband that loves her and what a wonderful life she's going to have when she gets away from Kings Landing. In the book, she knows nothing negative about Willas other than he's crippled and that doesn't bother her. I always think of Loras as the Westeros version of Justin Bieber (or more like Lance Bass), of-course she's going to jump at the chance to get out of Kings Landing with him.
I don't think she has a concept of what really goes on in the marriage bed either, her parents did a terrible job preparing any of their kids for life in Kings Landing or for playing the Game of Thrones.
2691	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-29	Why do people dislike Sansa for fantasizing and dreaming?Sansa's character arc has been more than that, and you can't just look at the fantasizing without what came before when considering people's reactions to her.  To many people, she was easy to dislike in AGOT given her treatment towards her sister, particularly the component where she made fun of her because of her looks, or because she wasn't ladylike enough, etc..  Then lying about Mycah, ratting our her father's plans to Cersei, etc..  All of those actions became part of how people perceived her --the stuck-up, conceited girl who thinks the only things that matter are how pretty you are, and which boys like you.  And whose interest in the world is pretty much limited to how things will work out for her personally.  For many people, I think that doesn't paint a very attractive picture.Because of how things went in KL, she really hasn't had much of a chance (yet) to demonstrate that she's matured.  Her preoccupation with dreaming and fantasizing suggests that she still thinks that it's all about her, and so just fantasizes about how her life could be so much better.  There's nothing wrong with doing that on occasion, but that seems to be much more the case with Sansa than with her younger siblings Bran and Arya, who are acting and not just dreaming.   That doesn't make her a bad person, but I think it makes her less appealing as a character, especially in comparison with the level of activity in which everyone else seems engaged.  Again, her being stuck in KL really limits what she can do, so people are left with the somewhat negative impression of her from AGOT.Leaving aside nasty AGOT Sansa, I think the biggest problem she has in terms of perceptions is that people generally don't like watchin people who seem like they feel sorry for themselves all the time.  It's just not a very attractive or interesting quality.

The â<U+0080><U+009C>growing strongâ<U+0080><U+009D> pun reminds me of Olennaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sarcastic commentary on the Tyrell words.
I still wonder about the PW plot. In the book, as I recall, QoT has plotted that with LF; in the show, she plots with Varys *against* LF. I suppose she could plot the murder with LF and still plot against LFâ<U+0080><U+0099>s abduction plan (which is agains er interests anway).
The Aegon-Sansa pairing is intriguing, although I have mixed feelings about Aegon since Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m a bit of a Daniac.
In answer to a question above, it was Tyrion who asked Loras about the Kingsguard thing.
(As for Sansa, I sympathize and cut her a certain amount of slack for the wooby factor, and hope things work out for her, although hopefully sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll also grow up.)
2693	shiola	2013-04-21	This thread is for discussing what you loved about the episode, from the largest plot point to the smallest facial expression or background detail.Book/TV spoilers are fine inside spoiler tags ONLY.  If you do not know how to make one, it's simple.  Here is an example:[.spoiler]Darth Vader is Luke's father[/.spoiler] without the periods becomes
	Spoiler Darth Vader is Luke's father
I want everyone to be able to enjoy this thread, so please make sure anything that could remotely be considered a spoiler or hint is inside tags.  If you aren't sure, tag it anyway.I look forward to seeing what little details everyone picks up on!
2694	Spring Snow	2013-04-21	Everything involving Varys. Conleth Hill is incredible, one of my favorite actors on the show. His scene with the sorceror was chilling in a good way, and he had great chemistry with the QoT.
Likewise, Aflie Allen as Theon knocked it out of the park. I've never wanted to just give a fictional character a hug as much as poor Theon and his performance is a big part of that in addition to the circumstances.
Margaery is an immensely enjoyable character, and I disagree with everyone who says she's different from her book counterpart. She's just more prominent in the show, and for good reason, because Natalie Dormer I <3 you.
Poor Jaime. Great chemistry with Brienne, and the horribleness of Locke and co. was very well done.
edit: There's actually a lot more that I loved, really, but I'll write up a better post once I've watched the episode again. I always watch it with a large group, which distracts from the finer details.

2695	shiola	2013-04-21	I only got to see Dracarys so far, because I missed most of the episode.  But as of right now I can say that Emilia speaking Valyrian is one of my new favorite things.  And there was a little look exchanged between Barristan and Jorah when the Unsullied started pounding their staffs against the ground that totally looked like, "Aw yeah she is so cool." and I loved that.
2696	Ser Greguh	2013-04-21	Random compliments:
The scene between Margaery and Joffrey, as Cersei looks on, seemed at first glance to be spectacularly well-edited.  I want to rewatch that scene just for a shot-by-shot.  The set for Baelor's Sept is amazeballs.  The Tywin/Cersei scene was quietly pitch-perfect.  Emilia Clarke makes it sound like Valyrian was created specifically for her.  James Cosmo gave an amazing death scene.  Alfie Allen's reaction shot to realizing he was back in the torture room was sick.  This was maybe the best-scripted episode yet.  I can't think of a single misstep of dialogue and the pacing was really superb.
2697	Dove	2013-04-21	Theon's tear when he's talking about Ned and the Starks, and the clever manipulation that led up to his confession. Theon you poor, dumb, poor bastard.Jeor Mormont went down like a godddamn boss. The way he slammed Rast against the wall even after he got shanked, damn. They did him justice, imo.The BoB + the Hound continues to own, and Beric is very promising. Loved the Hound's reaction to hearing he was fighting Beric.hell yeah Dany

2698	lizziebeth	2013-04-21	I really enjoyed this episode.  Specific things that I liked:
Theon: Alfie Allen is breaking my heart.  I agree with Pure As Snow, I just wanna give him a big hug.
Ramsay: That look when they were putting Theon back on the rack...  /leaving.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':leaving:' />
LC Mormont:  I actually may have teared up a bit when Rast stabbed him in the back.  But hell yeah, choke him out, Mormont, go down fighting! 
BwB and the Hound: Can't wait to see Beric vs Sandor.  And Arya very well might be the bravest person in that whole room (cave? lol). 
Jamie and Brienne:  I love these two so much. Poor depressed handless Jaime and Brienne recognizing that he lied to save her. 
Dany: Dracarys!
2699	Jabronius Maximus	2013-04-21	Ramsay's got the same crazy eyes that I imagined...that will definitely be a must-watch story line. Bad Luck Theon will become a meme soon enough, I bet.
	Spoiler  Would've loved to see the shot of a crow pecking out Mormont's face, but that was still an awesome mess at Craster's. Maybe we'll still see Captain Crow's face being eaten up 

Jaime is finally coming around, and I love to hear from my friends how he's becoming one of their favorites, like I said he would. Great scenes with Brienne.
This was really the second best episode of the series, so let's hope they keep the ball rolling.

2700	Spring Snow	2013-04-21	I actually really liked the conversation between Ros and Varys too, talking business and joking about Pod. Thanks to the show Varys is probably way up there in my list of favorite characters, and it's nice to see him being clever, charismatic, and humane with his "employees" in contrast with Littlefinger's darker approach.
2701	Magic 8 Ball	2013-04-21	testing
	Spoiler Dany is all downhill from here on out
2702	Dove	2013-04-21	Joffrey being a manic, giggly little sociopathic dork during his and Marge's "history lesson.""He thought drinking wildfire would turn him to a dragon. Hahaha!.... he was wrong."Hell, all of their interactions are brilliant. His eagerness to please is palpable but he's still such a creepy little ass, it's sort of treading new ground but at the same time it feels incredibly faithful to the character and source.

Loved seeing the sept of Baelor, and hearing some backstory on the Targs was great as well.

2706	~Shiera Seastar~	2013-04-21	Things I looove in this episode:
-Jaime on the 
	Spoiler mud,
and his scene with Brienne.
-Was it the sept where QOT, Cersei, Joff and Marg were? Well, I like it especially the part where 
	Spoiler the two lovebirds were waving at the crowd and Cersei felt like, "Wait! Can't believe I'm being left out!"

-The scenes in the Hollow Hill. Almost taken entirely from the book.
-Mutiny at the Craster's Keep. /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />
-Theon. Just not his lucky day.
-Astapor. What can I say? Probably one of the best scene you'll see on tv history.
2707	scurvy	2013-04-21	Really liked the scene with Sandor and the Brotherhood.  Watched it again.  Lord Beric has a nice scar on his neck that wasn't too visible from far away the first time.

2709	modbelle	2013-04-21	-Varys tale of being cut with Tyrion, especially the jack-in-a-box ending.-Tywin Lannister- Just himself is enough.  I could even watch something as lame as Tywin diaries, and it would still be awesome.  I especially liked the line where he told Cersei it wasn't that she was a woman but that she wasn't as smart as she thought she was.  Burn.  lol, his inner monologue was probably: I once had a cupbearer smarter than you.  But by far my favorite Tywin moment was his face when Cersei told him that she would like to see him try to reign in Joffrey.  I swear it was a "challenge accepted" look.  Of course, I'll be able to reign Joffrey in, I'm Tywin Lannister; I was the Hand of the King under Mad King Aerys.-Arya's face when she told about the Hound killing Micah, and Beric's apprising look and agreeing she might be the bravest there.-Dany speaking Valyrian and the dragon doing a flybye.-Sansa's face when Marg tells her she wants to be the sister.  It was priceless and perfect.  Marg deserves around of claps, because I am sure she gained information about Arya and Sansa's relationship before telling Sansa her story that made Marg come off sounding a bit like the sister Sansa misses (ie Pig-face Marg and Arya Horseface) to make Sansa want to join Marg's family.
2710	Kasrith	2013-04-21	Really liked the scene with Sandor and the Brotherhood.  Watched it again.  Lord Beric has a nice scar on his neck that wasn't too visible from far away the first time.Yup also picked up on the scar second time around
2711	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-21	Jaime just being completely humbled by the mummers/whatever was great.
2712	Team Renlys Peach	2013-04-21	Tywin: "You're still here..."
Queen of Thorns: "...What happens when the non existant bumps against the decrepit..."
2713	johnnysd	2013-04-22	I loved the little touch that Dany's accent was different and sounded more "high born". It added a lot of realism to a fake language
Best ending music ever.
I liked that maybe my favorite scene in the books, is also the best scene they have filmed in the series.
I like that I am starting to think HBO switched the budget to pounds instead of dollars
2714	LordStoneheart	2013-04-22	"Boy's" crazy look at the end of the Theon arc was awesome and confused the shit out of my brother and dad. Even though they made her kind of scary, I love that Bran and Catelyn got to interact in a sense. I hope they do that with Arya and Sansa later... Has there ever been a scene with Arya and Catelyn, book or show?
2715	LordStoneheart	2013-04-22	Actually, someone should make a GIF of "Boy's" crazy face. I would but I have no idea how.
2716	Dove	2013-04-22	http://i.imgur.com/xtIsRRJ.gifWelp, looks like someone called him "Barry" one too many times...
2717	Nezzer	2013-04-22	http://i.imgur.com/xtIsRRJ.gifWelp, looks like someone called him "Barry" one too many times...This.
2718	The Others Take Ya	2013-04-22	I was on the edge of my seat the whole episode, from the incredibly gripping (ha!) first shot of Jaime's hand dangling around his neck to the very epic march of the unsullied army.
There wasn't even any nakedness this episode! It was so epic they didn't cram in a single unnecessary boob. /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />  You know the story is going at a fast pace when there's no need for anyone to take their clothes off! Wow!

But we get Ygritte next week, so I'll keep it in my pants.
2720	Dove	2013-04-22	Show Margaery is basically amazing in every way, I can't get enough of her. The Porridge Plague, haha. They set up future events in a fantastic way with that one little scene and Sansa and Mags have great chemistry.This.ahahaha i love your avatars, dude
					
					
							Edited by chareth cutestory, 22 April 2013 - 02:26 AM.
2721	Tirilei	2013-04-22	There was a lot to love about this episode.
Theon: "I chose wrong."
Tywin: "I will."
Brienne: "..the real world where people have important things taken from them.."
Joffrey's facial expression, wondering what to make of Margaery's idea to step outside and greet the crowd.
Daenerys: "A dragon is not a slave!"
					
					
							Edited by Tirilei, 23 April 2013 - 12:23 AM.
2722	Ramsay Blow	2013-04-22	I loved when the QoT laughs at Varys for surrendering too easily as he "acts" like he was going to walk away, always the master manipulator.  
The "boy" acting all concerned when Theon was talking about killing the 2 boys. 
The Hound ripping everyone.
Tywin throwing haymakers at Cersei, loved it. He's more back to book Tywin this season.
Drogon looked great too. Wonderful episode.
2723	JMJ	2013-04-22	A nice foreshadowing: Tywin, when interacting with his kids, Cersei in this episode, Tyrion earlier on, is always writing something. Non-book readers won't realize till after the fact that he is planning...
	Spoiler 
The Red Wedding
2724	Jon Bon Snowvi	2013-04-22	I thought the scene with the Hound and the BwoB was well done and almost exactly how I pictured it from the book... Although I always assume the hound is drunk - his speech about not being like his brother seemed too civilized for him...
How hot is Daenarys!  That scene was insane!  
And I am even starting to like varys
					
					
							Edited by Jon Bon Snowvi, 22 April 2013 - 01:58 AM.
2725	Nictarion	2013-04-22	Daenerys' Valyrian speech was an incredible build up to the best moment on the show to date.
The unsullied looked amazing in action.
The look between Jorah and Barristan was great. Yes you backed the right girl.
Daenerys leading the army at the end with the dragons flying above might be the coolest thing I have ever see.
The sept of Baelor was really cool.
The QOT finally got her time to shine, she had some great lines.
I really liked Theon saying his real father died in KL.
					
					
							Edited by Nictarion, 22 April 2013 - 02:23 AM.
2726	greensleeves	2013-04-22	I loved the scene where Theon expresses his regret.  It was very moving, and also cleverly clued Ramsay in on the Stark boys (now the people in-the-know on that topic are roughly the same as in the books).
2727	Angmar	2013-04-22	All of Varys' scenes, his interactions with the Queen of Thorns...So good.
All of the Daenerys scene. The build up is just amazing, up until the end. The music and all, the scenery.
Theon's scenes, I just knew what would happen right away. Lots of heartbreak from Theon this season, ouh.
The scene with the BWB was pretty good, straight out of the book. Loved Arya's intervention, Sandor's calling out on the BWB of accusing him of the crimes Gregor did...I really can't wait till the fight scene and Sandor taking Arya.
A very good episode, thankfully without filler sex scenes only there to fill in time. Even Ros' part didn't take much time.
More episodes like this, and the season will be perhaps the best of the three, just as the book!
2728	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	I loved Tywin's scene, and how he crashed Cersei's ego.
And I love how Varys changed the tone of  his voice when he said "It's been a long time my frind... The revenge you want will be yours in time".
2729	Joyful Union	2013-04-22	"My real father lost his head at King's Landing". /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' /> /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' /> /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />
2730	Mr Hodor	2013-04-22	The crowd chanting joff and margery, the unsullied, high valyrian, tywin educating cersei. Loved almost everything this episode.*post content deleted*Shouldnt all your text be in spoiler tag?
2731	Mediumjon Umber	2013-04-22	Where to begin? The scenes with Jaime were amazing, the sept of Baelor was magnificent. Really liked Dondarrion, and the mutiny at Craster's keep went down better than I expected. But the final seven minutes! Whoa! AMAZING!
Plus, getting some background on Varys was nice. The fact that the sorcerer threw his manhood on the brazier is very interesting and reminded me of what the red priests do. Could he really have king's blood...?
2732	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	Whoever did the set design for the sept of Baelor deserves a medal. The interior, as well as the statues of the 7 were absolutely stunning.
2733	victim	2013-04-22	No spoilers:
- Everything Margaerey (holy shit! she's perfect)
- Queen of Thorns comparing "Growing Strong" to "Winter is Coming" and "We Do Not Sew"
- Varys' story of how he got cut
- Sophie Turner's acting has improved so much since Season 1
- All the backstory on the BwB. I was so worried their intentions were going to be lost in the world of the show. It's good to see how faithful to the books it all was.
- Beric Motherfuckin' Dondarrion!
- The mutiny.
- The Dracarys 
- And Theon and Boy.
2734	Roose Seal	2013-04-22	No spoilers:- Everything Margaerey (holy shit! she's perfect)- Queen of Thorns comparing "Growing Strong" to "Winter is Coming" and "We Do Not Sew"- Varys' story of how he got cut- Sophie Turner's acting has improved so much since Season 1- All the backstory on the BwB.

Even the Varys x Ros scene, while a little useless, was fun.Also: "And what happens when the non-existent bumps against the decrepit" might just be my favorite line uttered in this show so far.

	Spoiler Dany is all downhill from here on out
Yes totally. Dany's most badass moment was when she conquered Astapor. After that... well..
2738	Aripyanfar	2013-04-22	Best Bite On The Arse: Micah the Butcher's Boy coming back to haunt The Hound edges out Craster starving the Crows.Best Scenery: Tie between the long shot of the tree Bran subsequently climbs and falls from, and the ferns outside the BWB's cave.Best Dress: Sansa's new one.Most Piquant Delayed Gratification: Varys' Scorcerer In A Box.Most Useful Crowd Seeding: Margaery organising people to cry out "Bless King Joffrey".Season's Most Gutting Burn: Tywin dis-Heiring Tyrion still trumps Tywin telling Cercei, "It's not because you're a woman, it's because you are not as intelligent as you think you are."Best Varys-Littlefinger Verbal Joust: Varys-Olenna.Best Acting: Sansa's lower lip wobbling at finally getting her Knight-In-Shining-Armour-With-Beautiful-Castle and a woman who WANTS to be her sister. Only Goosebumps Up The Neck: Unsullied thumping their spears for Daenerys Stormborn.
2739	Warrior Queen	2013-04-22	I loved:
- The Queen of Thrones talking about how shitty a Golden Rose is as a sigil and that the words Growing Strong don't scare anyone. She is so witty!
- The Sept of Baelor. I never pictured the statues of the 7 to be that big! It looked absolutely amazing!
- The References to Rhaenyra Targaryen and Aerion Brightflame. I love how Marg is playing Joffrey.
-  Varys and the sorcerer. When the scene started it felt really out of place that he started telling about how he was cut. But once he said 'It's been a long time, my old friend' and 'The revenge you want will be yours in time' it all fell into place. This scene also showed how dangerous Varys really is. I was really surprised about him saying these lines in this context though.
- Dracarys, the look of the city, the unsullied, the dragons, the last shot of the episode. AMAZING! And the Valyrian, wow i was blown away it sounded to realistic and Emilia is a natural! Loved it! can't wait to hear more.
- The Marg and Sansa Scene. Great acting from both ladies! Sansa looked like she was about to cry out of happiness.
- 'My real father lost his head in Kings Landing'
	Spoiler 
Ramsey's evil look right before we saw Theon was going back to the Bolton flaying cross. Awsome

2741	Stannis' shadow babies	2013-04-22	Obvious aside (dracarys), the conversation between Cersei and Tywin. I absolutely loved it. I'm not very much into Lena Headey's acting but I thought it was pitch perfect, especially when Tywin says "you're not as smart as you think you are" because you could see she was hurt, as it brought back Tyrion's words ('still more clever than you'). On the other hand, Charles Dance is always perfect.
Boy's totally psycho smile when Theon is recaptured. Brilliant.
'My father lost his head in King's Landing' . Heartbreaking, a fantastic addition.

2742	SerMixalot	2013-04-22	I even loved Vary's shoes with the upturned toes.
2743	Elba the Intoner	2013-04-22	Those last three storylines with Crasters, the Hound telling off the BWB and Dany were amazing! The mutiny at Crasters was well done. Mormont was so powerful right up to the very end. I really believed Sam when he told Gilly that they had to leave NOW! The ending with Dany was just fantastic and visually stunning. And of course, in the BwB scene I loved the dialogue. The Hound was perfection and I am fascinated by the guy who plays Beric. Man, I am so friggin excited about the trial by battle next episode!
2744	Gannicus	2013-04-22	It's hard to know where to begin but my top three.
1. Dany being a boss
2. Tywin being Tywin, "I will"
3. Theon "I chose wrong" Greyjoy, "My father lost his head at KL"
2745	Battlekitten	2013-04-22	We do not sew. We crochet !
Couldn't resist
2746	i-sawr-the-ghost-of-harren	2013-04-22	THEON: My real father lost his head at King's Landing. I made a choice... and I chose wrong.
2747	Aripyanfar	2013-04-22	THEON: My real father lost his head at King's Landing. I made a choice... and I chose wrong.All of season 2 my heart was breaking for Theon.  Even when he got to Winterfell and turned on everyone there, even the burnt little boys, I was all "no no no there is no love for you, and no respect for you this way, you are now completely alone."   That one scene where he was being being (re?)baptised to the Drowned God, and the seawater ran like tears drenching his face, it haunted me then, and it's seemed to follow his every move since.  Whenever I see him, I see him drenched in inner tears.
2748	servethe_Realm	2013-04-22	I absolutely LOVED the Sept of Baelor. I love how they imagined the ceiling and the seven-pointed star. I could see a few of the bases of the various statues but would love to see them up close. I believe the two I recall glimpsing were the Maiden and the Warrior
2749	ShigellaSand	2013-04-22	Olenna Tyrell and Varys. Great characters, great dialogue, great acting.Joffrey's insane delight at the insanity of Targaryens past. Yeah, that would be the parts of history he'd remember.Margaery calmly and expertly manipulating psycho Joffrey, then turning around and just as expertly manipulating Sansa.Tywin and Cersei. Every scene with any combination of Tywin/Tyrion/Cersei just shines. And the irony of Tywin seeing clearly how messed up Joffrey is, and blaming it on Cersei, but even though he sees how messed up his kids are that obviously can't be his fault in any way.Jaime in the mud, and the look on Brienne's face as she tried to come to his rescue.The Hound refuting every death of a child the Brotherhood tried to blame him for, only to get caught out by Arya.Theon. Lost, lonely Theon, not at home anywhere, realizing just how deep into a hole he's dug himself.And now his watch is ended. "He came to us from... Where did he come from?" "Never thought Bannon could smell so good." Fare thee well, Mormont. (Please don't turn into a wight.)All the Dany stuff. Kraznyz struggling with the dragon, Valyrian, Dracarys, freeing the Unsullied, the little look Barristan and Jorah exchanged...
2750	ReekLeek	2013-04-22	Loved the mutiny at crasters and carts QoT scenes.  Also the dracarys scene was powerful. Really the last 40 minutes were great.
2751	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-04-22	Can we just say Everything? This was one of the BEST episodes of this series. All of the acting was spot-on from goofy Joffrey to Alfie Allen to Tywin and Emilia Clarke. I'm totally mixing up the actor and character names.  The Hound! He steals every scene he is in. Jaime and Brienne.  The only thing to dislike is that the Old Bear died and that scene was very well-done, too. The tension that was building up until it spilled over.
I loved all of it, including Sansa's dress - so beautiful.
I think I could listen to Conleth Hill telling stories as Varys all day long.
Also, I don't know if it's just me but Beric Dondarrion totally looks like Buck from Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs

2752	BronnFan	2013-04-22	I thought Burn Gorman playing the Brother who put an end to Craster was absolutely brilliant in his small-ish role.
2753	Nezzer	2013-04-22	I thought Burn Gorman playing the Brother who put an end to Craster was absolutely brilliant in his small-ish role.Yeah, he was amazing."You are a bastard. A daughter-fucking wildling bastard" /lmao.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lmao:' />
2754	MsLibby	2013-04-22	One of the little things that I really liked was when Jaime pulled the sword on the guy and then tossed it in the air and caught it with his left hand so he was holding it better to fight with.
Something so small, but I loved it.
2755	MsLibby	2013-04-22	I thought Burn Gorman playing the Brother who put an end to Craster was absolutely brilliant in his small-ish role.Always enjoyed him in Torchwood and had the chance to see him in Oliver in London's West End. He is a very fine actor and has a real presence. I'd like to see him do more work.
2756	shiola	2013-04-22	I'm excited to read through all of this!  Here are mine from the first watch:- Bran's outfit is always my favorite.- The fucking set for the Great Sept!  It's incredible- The set for the BWB hideout.  Holllly crap, maybe my favorite in the series.- Barristan and Jorah's "Awww yeah gurl" looks after Dracarys. Seen here:http://25.media.tumb...pxxpo1_1280.png- More Margaery ownage on all fronts- Everything Jaime- Transition between Jaime/Brienne scene and Cersei/Tywin scene was Jaime staring into the fire and then Cersei staring into a candle- Tons of Varys screen time

2757	shiola	2013-04-22	The Hound was incredible.  I think that's the most dialogue he's ever had.  I loved it so, so much.
	Spoiler I hope he gets tons with Arya.
2758	HouseLark	2013-04-22	The Queen of Thorns saying what we all know: Sansa (at this point) is bloody boring.
Daenerys the Conqueror - Emilia Clarke is just owning this show now. Her scenes so far feel like the writers giving her a massive apology for the way they ballsed up last season.
2759	BronnFan	2013-04-22	Always enjoyed him in Torchwood and had the chance to see him in Oliver in London's West End. He is a very fine actor and has a real presence. I'd like to see him do more work.Never saw Torchwood but knew a little about it. Was impressed enough with his performance last night to look him up on IMDB. A shame that's the last we'll likely see of Karl.
2760	MsLibby	2013-04-22	If you want to see Burn Gorman really shine, check  out Bleak House. It's excellent and he is great.  Charles Dance is in it as well
2761	Ser Luke.	2013-04-22	Nearly everything was perfect in this episode. 
The highlights:
-Craster's Keep
-Dracarys
-Theon/Ramsay
-The Hound/Beric
-Varys/Queen of Thorns
-Jaime/Brienne
I could go on and on.
2762	Stormie	2013-04-22	The look between Jorah and Barristan was great. Yes you backed the right girl.Yep I loved that moment. Particularly in light of the dressing-down she gave them both last episode, for daring to argue with her plans in public.They perfectly captured that sense of "oops, looks like she actually does know what she's doing".
2763	Rapsie	2013-04-22	No Bronn! Hurrah
Excellent scenes with Dany, Brienne/Jaime and Sandor/BWB.
2764	Juliads	2013-04-22	positive moments for me,
Dany. For once i genuinely enjoyed her performance.  Very well acted and totally believable.
theon was great.  That actor brings so much more personality to the character than his book equivalent.
Sansa's subtle nuanced reaction to being 'sisters' with Marg, the promise to escape KL and leave her prisoners was very very well done.  Made me feel so sad for her. 
The HOUND was freaking awesome!  This must have been the most line's he's ever had.  I love the actor who plays him, i think he's very capable of pulling off Sandor's more complex moments.  They turned him into a mute in the previous seasons-save for Blackwater of course.  I'm looking forward to his scenes more then most of the others.
2765	shiola	2013-04-22	I thought Sophie's reaction to Sansa getting to marry Loras was spot on.
And I love the way Dany still had the Valyrian accent when she said "Dracarys".  When they showed her teaching her dragons the word in season 2, she had no hint of that accent.  It sounded soooo good this time.
2766	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	Joffrey being a manic, giggly little sociopathic dork during his and Marge's "history lesson.""He thought drinking wildfire would turn him to a dragon. Hahaha!.... he was wrong."Hell, all of their interactions are brilliant. His eagerness to please is palpable but he's still such a creepy little ass, it's sort of treading new ground but at the same time it feels incredibly faithful to the character and source.HAHAHA, Joffrey made me laugh so much, that crazy kidI LOVE gleeson's portrayal, he's FANTASTIC
2767	shiola	2013-04-22	HAHAHA,Joffrey made me laugh so much, that crazy kidI LOVE gleeson's portrayal, he's FANTASTIC
	Spoiler I am going to miss Joffrey if only for Gleeson's acting....
2768	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	I'm so glad we had some awesome Sandor moments, can't wait for the trial!!! It'll be spectacular!
2769	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	snip
	Spoiler  Me too. I actually kind of wish that he wasn't dying until much later. I'm so going to miss Gleeson, he's been spectacular as Joffrey
2770	Spring Snow	2013-04-22	I know, I loved his interaction with Beric quite a lot. I enjoyed Sandor in the books too, but he has an even better presence in the TV show thanks to a very strong actor. "You want to cut my throat? Get on with it!"
2771	lostinwesteros	2013-04-22	The Queen of Thorns telling Varys, "No", that he couldn't sit down.  I'm a true Varys fan, so it hurt a little to see him 'checked', but the QOT was just being the QOT, and she made it up to him later, I think.
2772	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	What's really impressed me about Gleeson this season is while last season Joff was pretty much the devil incarnate, the actor has actually been able to humanize such a despicable character. He conveys Joffrey's insecurities and desire to impress Margaery superbly, as well as his fear of the people he's oppressing.
2773	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	I know, I loved his interaction with Beric quite a lot. I enjoyed Sandor in the books too, but he has an even better presence in the TV show thanks to a very strong actor. "You want to cut my throat? Get on with it!"He's one of my favourite characters and Rory is totally killing it. I think he's wonderful. I loved his disdainful reaction to the name of his Brother.
2774	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	What's really impressed me about Gleeson this season is while last season Joff was pretty much the devil incarnate, the actor has actually been able to humanize such a despicable character. He conveys Joffrey's insecurities and desire to impress Margaery superbly, as well as his fear of the people he's oppressing.He's one of my favourites, definitely. I think Joffrey this season is hilarious. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />
2775	shiola	2013-04-22	Joffrey is fantastic this season.  He's so funny and Gleeson does it perfectly.  He's just like, "Aw yeah this hot bitch likes me, she thinks I'm so cool, she likes the things I like, I'm so giddy, I don't need my mom anymore, I'm such a fucking boss" but he's so awkward about it and terrible at it.  I never thought I'd enjoy Joffrey.
2776	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	I love how excited he gets everytime Marg shows enthusiasm LOL. He's like a giddy child. 
And it was a really nice way to add in some Targ history and the architecture was beautiful!
2777	Stark Winds	2013-04-22	"My real father lost his head at King's Landing". /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' /> /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' /> /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />I was being completely thick when I saw that and was like, "but Balon Greyjoy is ali...OH! Awwww" (cue waterworks). Seriously. The show made me like Theon so much more. I felt bad for book Theon, but I never really liked him much.Pretty much this.I can't think of one scene in this episode that I didn't like. Even the Varys x Ros scene, while a little useless, was fun.Also: "And what happens when the non-existent bumps against the decrepit" might just be my favorite line uttered in this show so far.Yes. Yes yes! And no pointless nudity in this episode. Maybe they're holding out for next episode...although those scenes are actually part of the story...soooo...what have we learned today? Less pointless scenes=more story=better scenes=better episodes!We do not sew. We crochet !Couldn't resistOh my god I almost died of laughter /drunk.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drunk:' /> Always enjoyed him in Torchwood and had the chance to see him in Oliver in London's West End. He is a very fine actor and has a real presence. I'd like to see him do more work.I had the most geekiest fit when I saw him. "OWEN what are you doing in Westeros??" Hahaha.Margaery... /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' /> I really like what the writers are doing with her character, and Natalie Dormer portrays her so well. Again I love how out of his element Joffrey seems when dealing with Margaery. Makes me almost go "aww" until he starts acting like the sadistic little child he is.Also Dany in this episode... /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />I'm rejoicing as much as Jorah and Barristan were at that last scene. It was beautifully shot! The slo-mo dropping of the whip, then the camera panning over the massive Unsullied army...I apologize for this long post. I don't think there was anything I disliked about this episode ahaha
2778	shiola	2013-04-22	I cannot praise the set of the Great Sept enough.  It's stunning.
2779	shiola	2013-04-22	Long posts are good, Stark Winds!  That means there was much and more to love :]
Great avatar, by the way.  I love that photoshoot
2780	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	He's one of my favourites, definitely. I think Joffrey this season is hilarious. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />Agreed. I was surprised how happy I was to see Joffrey in all his scenes this season. His genuine confusion at the concept of charity in episode 1 was hilarious.
2781	Spring Snow	2013-04-22	I cannot praise the set of the Great Sept enough.  It's stunning.And it has such an enthusiastic little tour guide as well. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> Even knowing what we do about her it's hard to not feel badly for Cersei when she's looking up at the young couple with tears in her eyes, and realizing that she's "losing" him.
2782	shiola	2013-04-22	And it has such an enthusiastic little tour guide as well. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />Even knowing what we do about her it's hard to not feel badly for Cersei when she's looking up at the young couple with tears in her eyes, and realizing that she's "losing" him.Her love for her children is her one redeeming quality, after all.  (Well, that and her cheekbones, according to Tyrion!)  As fucked up as she is, and as bad as Joffrey is, she does love him. And it's sad that she is finally recognizing how awful and reckless he is.  She wanted him to be like Jaime, and he's nothing like Jaime but more like Aerys...  Viewing her as a mother, it's very sad, and Lena acts it flawlessly.

2783	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	My only worry is that Joffrey might become a bit likable, and actually gain some fans. We don't need another Malfoy
2784	Spring Snow	2013-04-22	But hasn't that already happened with Ramsay "Boy" /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />I think this is just the tip of the iceburg with Joffrey, and we'll be getting a few reminders of just who he really is soon.
	Spoiler Remember the "Everyone is mine to torment" line from the trailers? That seems relevant.

2785	darksellsword	2013-04-22	The part were Emilia Clarke as Daenerys says AXIO XENTAS MENTIO XENTAS . I dont speak Valyrian but i can just tell
those words were the part about killing and she sounds like a demon when she says them, gave me
goose pimples and a smile at the same time /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
2786	Chalice_of_Malice	2013-04-23	Sansa's expression when Margaery tells her about becoming betrothed to Loras just about broke my goddamn heart. The poor little thing is going to be the flipping death of me. /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />

2788	insertname	2013-04-23	I'm just going to say "practically everything" - this episode was near as perfect as you can get imo.
2789	therustman	2013-04-23	I loved Joffery's wave, pissed myself laughing so much missed the start of the next scene.
2790	SerMixalot	2013-04-23	I like Mormont's death, although it is cliche for the tough guy who gets stabbed to grab the stabber as he dies, it was well done, very badass, the coughed up blood is when it really hit me.  Just sad we didnt get his last words
2791	hollowcrown	2013-04-23	This is what an episode of Game of Thrones should be.
Things were elaborated on, that we didn't see in the book, such as Varys/Olenna, Joffrey/Margaery, Tywin/Cersei and Theon's journey into becoming Reek, and were great scenes.
The scenes from the book...Jaime getting bullied, Dracarys, and the trial of the Hound, were perfect.
And where stuff had to deviate from the book like Sansa being married to Loras, the scenes were beautiful and acting was spot on.
One of the best episodes ever!! No pointless nudity either!

2792	Ser Wun Wun	2013-04-23	Probably my favorite episode of the series so far!  I loved the Varys/QoT scene.  I thought the show-invented dialogue was witty and sounded like something the actual book characters would say.  'what happens when the nonexistent meets the decrepit?'  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

2793	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2013-04-23	I find it so hard to not watch the second half of this ep over and over...
Sets.....
Baelor. It's not what I had envisioned - its more closed in than what I had pictured but the location they chose is mindblowing
BwB - there was something special about it, both the outside and the actual entrance to the cave.
There was a lot about this ep that felt like a series final, most particularly because of the events at Astapor, but the whole episode just seemed really well paced. Jaime/Brienne at the start got you in. a little piece of Bran early (to fill a Bran quota I guess), all the scenes in KL that seemed to really work together and push the story - then the big 3: Craster's, BwB v Sandor and Astapor.
					
					
							Edited by Ser Desmond Wine's Bane, 23 April 2013 - 08:34 AM.
2794	shiola	2013-04-23	I agree about the pacing, it was fantastic.
2795	victim	2013-04-23	After a second watch, I have a few more:
- Sansa praying to a Weirwood stump. 
- Eddison Tollett: "We're like the sons he never had."
- Speaking of Edd, he and Grenn actually seemed like characters. First time they've appeared in a scene without Jon or Sam?
- Craster's axe was the one given to him in 2x01.
- Mentions of "Brightflame," Aegon and Rhaenys.
- Jaime reaching for the sword with his stump.
I could go on forever, so I'll stop there.
2796	Lord Warhammer	2013-04-23	I am not a Dany fan at all but fuckin DRACARYS. I almost became a supporter.
When Grenn went into beast mode at Crasters KeepI actually yelled out "Hell
'Yeah"
2797	SerArthurHeath	2013-04-23	I genuinely think that at least 80% of characters are more interesting and better portrayed on the Show than in the Books. This is partially at least because the acting is superb, but also because we are not PoV restricted, it has its downsides like making some motivations and decisions harder to understand but I think it really helps the story, in general
2798	shiola	2013-04-23	After a second watch, I have a few more:- Sansa praying to a Weirwood stump.- Eddison Tollett: "We're like the sons he never had."- Speaking of Edd, he and Grenn actually seemed like characters.

The shot of Sansa praying was beautiful.  And I love Grenn so much, but Pyp always stuck out to me on the show  more than Edd.  It's a shame because I like Edd so much in the books but I don't know if nonreaders even know his name?The italics I did not notice but I have to re-watch for them because that is fucking AWESOME.  Small details like that are my favorites.
2799	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-23	I genuinely think that at least 80% of characters are more interesting and better portrayed on the Show than in the Books. This is partially at least because the acting is superb, but also because we are not PoV restricted, it has its downsides like making some motivations and decisions harder to understand but I think it really helps the story, in generalThe characters I believe that are present in both the show and in the books that are better in the books are Cat, Littlefinger, and Stannis. I think everyone is else at least almost as good or better in the show. And I've been reading since 2001 or so, shortly after aSoS came out.
2800	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-23	I genuinely think that at least 80% of characters are more interesting and better portrayed on the Show than in the Books. This is partially at least because the acting is superb, but also because we are not PoV restricted, it has its downsides like making some motivations and decisions harder to understand but I think it really helps the story, in generalI don't particularly agree. Stannis, Catelyn and Petyr Baelish are miles better in the books. But there certainly ARE characters that are better in the show, ie Osha and Theon.
2801	Silverx2	2013-04-23	I like Jorahs new armor.
The armor from season 1 and 2 was kind of a hodgepodge. but this new blue set is very fetch.
2802	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-23	I don't particularly agree. Stannis, Catelyn and Petyr Baelish are miles better in the books. But there certainly ARE characters that are better in the show, ie Osha and Theon.I agree with those three, but most everyone else is as good or better to me. Although Jon Snow could be argued, and Asha/Yara seemed pretty lame although in general her role is pretty small. For a cast of so many, that's actually quite remarkable.
2803	Dove	2013-04-23	- Jaime reaching for the sword with his stump.I didn't notice that at all! That's a nice touch. Damn, Jaime.
2804	Montey14	2013-04-23	Although she didn't have many lines in this episode Aryas accusing of the hound was  spot on ....the slight tremelo in her voice as she accused him of riding down Mycha....you could almost hear her thinking "fear cuts deeper than swords"
2805	Montey14	2013-04-23	The crow that stabbed Craster....I forgot his name in the book....was he even mentioned in the episode....he was a pretty sinister character.....very well played .....also I would have liked a  little cameo from the Goat...would ahve been comical to hear the slobbering and the lisping
2806	Rain of Castamere	2013-04-24	"He would see the kingdom burn if he could be the king of the ashes"
goosebumps!
one of the most powerfull quotes of the whole series!
2807	Sun	2013-04-24	Brienne and Jaime's scenes. They were superb! Damn, NCW is doing some of his best work in this role.Theon's monologue in the Dreadfort. Well written superbly delivered.Ramin Djawadi's music for Dany's Dracarys scene. Astoundingly good. The music is what makes that scene. He has to get an Emmy for it, anything less would be a travesty.Varys' scene with Tyrion - the sorcerer's tale. Such an intimate and powerful scene. So well written, acted, shot, plotted, blocked. It was just perfect.ETA:- Jaime reaching for the sword with his stump.Yes, that was such a wonderful moment. Again, NCW is superb.

2810	Ser Dermett Corbray	2013-04-24	Great sept of Baelor was awe inspiring. Joffrey's enthusiasm for the crypts for darkly amusing.
Good comedy from QoT and Edd.
Theon's monologue. Alfie Allen is awesome.
Jaime and Brienne saying so much with so little.
Tywin writing more letters. Ominous.
Conleth nailing all his Varys scenes as usual.
Burn Gorman's appearance as the Night's Watch revolt instigator,
2811	Rain of Castamere	2013-04-24	the majority of this episode is rather awesome, seeing it the second time is even better.
Alfies performance when he confesses his fault is outstanding. im in awe!
a thing im not sure was mentioned allready was the hounds spit in the middle of the sentence when he speaks of his brother.
"Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother. in king roberts name!"
"Ned Stark is dead! King Robert is dead! My brother is alive" *spit*
seriously, how can one not root for sandor!? hes the man!
i would also like to link the expression on danys face at 2 occasions but the forum wount let me post or link to a picture uploader?!

Also, Ramseys smile was pure evil.
2813	Kasporio	2013-04-24	My apologies, wasn't vague enough on some points. Swear i'm going to search the post "OMG they're screwing the whole plots from the books".
The guy who stabbed this SOB of Craster...was from the sisters....missing a arm...something like that.
2814	Sword of the Morning Wood	2013-04-24	The guy who killed Craster was fantastic. He's been on a few shows in the UK so I recognise the face but the delivery of "But you are a bastard. A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard." was hard as nails.

Though pointing out that you don't sew is still something better than a rose growing stronger.
2829	FattyPeon	2013-04-26	"We do not sew"
"So how did you get the Kraken badge on your tunic?"
"...."
2830	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-26	Love the chest-bump he does with that too. He sold the whole incoherent rage thing really well. It's like damn Krusty, calm down or a stroke/heart disease is gonna get ya before Burn Gorman doesI love it. I also think there was a whole lot of tension right before he said ''You are a bastard'' I seriously on edge as I knew what was coming but still waiting for it to happen."You got a nice wet twat between yer legs?"Oh, Craster, I'm going to miss you, you despicable, crusty old bastard.I'll miss his dirty, wheezy old man laugh.
2831	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-26	I'll miss his dirty, wheezy old man laugh.I am so glad someone uploaded this: http://www.youtube.c...h?v=zHnvEzcjjvw
2832	Dove	2013-04-26	I am so glad someone uploaded this: http://www.youtube.c...h?v=zHnvEzcjjvwFantastic. Hello, new ringtone.
2833	RoamingRonin	2013-04-26	I adored this episode. It was rich with dialogue and history straight from the books but it never felt like I was being force-fed exposition.  The scenery, the costumes... so lush and vibrant. I've got a new TV and everything just looks amazing. Easily one of the top episodes of the series so far. Could be my favorite episode. The end with Dany's armies and her dragons flying... Wow.
2834	Lady Arwen	2013-04-26	I have to say, the final overhead shot of the troops leaving Astapor with the dragons flying overhead was beyond brilliant. The first time I saw that shot, I thought, "This is ASOIAF. They got it right." Epic.
2835	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-26	I am so glad someone uploaded this: http://www.youtube.c...h?v=zHnvEzcjjvwCraster might sneakily be the best minor character cast. BTW what freaking accent is that?
2836	FattyPeon	2013-04-26	BTW what freaking accent is that?I think its Daughter-Fucking, Wilding Bastard
2837	Tywin's bastard	2013-04-27	When I've rewatched the episode my favorite scene has eventually become Beric Dondarrion's first scene. I really enjoy all the characters there, I love that The Hound gets to speak more, and my favorite moment is Beric announcing that he's the one to fight the dog.
I also like that Sansa is praying to a white tree stump. It's not enormous but it can still be taken as some sort of hint that there had been a Godswood at King's Landing before.
2838	Loras	2013-04-28	Without echoing everyone else in this thread...
...the score in this episode was fantastic!
The most obvious example is the 'Dracarys' scene, but my favourite piece was the mixing of Theon's theme with the Stark theme.  Absolutely beautiful and painfully melancholy.
2839	lannistergold	2013-04-29	QoT is the best new character in my book. Loved every moment of her conversation with Varys: she's a steel vault when it comes to useful information..
2840	Rain of Castamere	2013-04-29	small detail but nonetheless cool, we see exactly 8000 unsullied on screen.
in the pan shot there are 10 big blocks of unsullied, each containing 4*5 small blocks, with each one of those holding 8*5 unsullied. it could be two more big blocks in the top right corner, but after all they are not on screen so we cant be sure allthough it would make sense.
8*5*4*5*10=8000
each big block containing 800 men, so lets assume one of the blocks we dont see are the 800 not finished training and the last block are no unsullied but the place where they piled up the corpse of the slavers, so we end up with the said 8800 in total /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />

2841	I love Cersei	2013-04-29	Also, I don't know if it's just me but Beric Dondarrion totally looks like Buck from Ice Age: Dawn of the DinosaursTotally! I knew I knew him from somewhere.
2842	First of My Name	2013-04-30	What I liked about this episode? Everything everything everything!
2843	go joff go	2013-04-21	Ok not exactly a ton of laughs in comparison to some of the others, but still some pretty good lines.
The Margeary/Sansa scene was amazingly mean spirited in a funny way.
I laughed when Sansa told Margary you must think I'm the dumbest person ever, and margaerys mouth said no, but everything else said yes
Also couldn't believe they put that line about having a pigs nose in there.  D&D have to have a lot of balls to even think about putting something like that in.
2844	Mediumjon Umber	2013-04-22	What Theon said about Ned being his real father (don't remember the actual quote) gave me a kind of sad lol. Oh, Theon, you Captain Hindsight of Westeros /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
2845	Ser Edmure Tully	2013-04-22	"I never thought Bannen could smell so good" 
Oh Edd
2846	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-22	"I never thought Bannen could smell so good"Oh EddThis /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />Some of the humour in this episode also comes not from actual lines, but subtlety, to me.Olenna's remarks on the Tyrell sigil (I've said literally the same words on a couple of occasions, lol).The Old Bear: "He came to us from... err... Where did he come from?"Joffrey trying to act like a pimp telling Margaery horror stories. Also his waving like a douche.Tywin 'You're not as smart as you think you are.' and his long pause before saying 'Contribute.' Also 'You're still here....' You could just see his annoyance xDKraznys: "You speak Valyrian?!" (his expression did it)Ramsay's horrible expression also made me laugh, in a 'Ramsay you're such a douche' kind of way.Locke: "Can't say I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast." /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> I know it's horrible, but I didn't see it coming and it made me laugh in an uncomfortable 'oh god no' kind of way. Jorah and Barristan looking at each other like bro's also made me smirk. I know they don't like each other, but two of my favourite characters getting along even if only briefly gets a smile on my face...

All the while Joffrey is giggling like a schoolgirl.  Brilliant acting by that kid, just amazing..

D&D have to have a lot of balls to even think about putting something like that in.I thought it was such a sad scene. Sansa almost cried of happiness when Marg told her her place would be at Highgarden is she married Loras.Great acting by Sophie Turner and Natalie Dormer.What Theon said about Ned being his real father (don't remember the actual quote) gave me a kind of sad lol. Oh, Theon, you Captain Hindsight of Westeros /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />This was so sad! He said something like; 'My real father's head was cut off in Kings Landing.' 'I had to make a choice and I choose wrong' I almost cried. But when we saw the Bolton cross and I felt really excited. I went from feeling bad for Theon to feeling really really excited about the rest of his storyline."I never thought Bannen could smell so good"Oh EddI laughed so hard.I also really like the witty Lady Olenna to the Tyrell cousins about the Golden Roses. ' I even have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell better' and making fun of how not scary the golden rose and their words going strong are lol.

2853	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-04-22	The QoT was spot-on this episode. I preferred her line delivery this time around much better than the first time we saw her and she was hilarious. I kept laughing and laughing.
I also loved Tywin's remarks to Cersei, especially telling her she's not as smart as she thinks she is.

2856	cybobbie	2013-04-22	Edd while tending the pigs cracked me up but his line "I never thought Bannen could smell so good" was priceless, I love Edd!
Tywin scene with Cersey was also funy in his cold and kind of annoyed way to say the lines.
But the best for me was the Queen of Thorns, she was simply amazing in this episode and had great moments like:
"I even have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell better" and "What happens when the non-existent bumps against the decrepit". Varys face on that scene was great!
2857	StarkDragon	2013-04-22	I can't help myself:
When Mormont asks where he (edit: he being Bannen) came from, then said he fought well, I wanted Edd to say:
"He was a steward!"
But Olenna's lines, all of them really, were great. Especially the 'non-existent and the decrepit'. Why did you look, Varys?

2859	greywindsrage	2013-04-22	"I never thought Bannen could smell so good"Oh EddAnd we have the winner.
2860	Azor Ahoy!	2013-04-22	"Oh look, more shit!"
Almost all of Olenna, especially "My chamber pot has a rose on it, but it doesn't make it smell any better!"
The horse piss line.
Joff's laughter at "They buried what's left of her in the crypt!"
2861	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-22	I loved Edd's remarks. 
The QoT was a boss. I love how she mimicked the North's accent when talking about "Winter is coming." And her acerbic flirtation with Varys, paired with his downward glance at his nethers at her "nonexistent" line. 
This is funnier on a rewatch, but Ramsay's saying "wait" as he lights the torch. It sounds so much like he's getting to a punchline--there's a subtle uptick that sounds overeager. Plus, his total jackal grin. 
Joffrey acting like a lovesick puppy--giggling like a schoolgirl is dead on. Also, his little "Ha!" glance at Cersei when he walks by, arm around Margaery's waist.
2862	Peptalk	2013-04-22	I just made a thread about this kinda, and am suprised nobody above mentions the scence with Joffrey talking about how the women targaryn was eaten by her brothers dragon while her babies watched.

It might well be my favourite one liner for the series. I nearly died. He sells a psycho so damn well. WOW. That was just... brilliant.
2863	Mark Antony	2013-04-22	QoT to Varys: What happens when the non-existent bumps against the decrepitFuckin awesome, Queen of Thorns>>
2864	Dove	2013-04-22	Yeah, Joffrey enthusing about history was absolutely brilliant. You sociopathic little scamp.
Everything involving Varys and QoT cracking wise. Love those two, love them together.
Edd: "We're like the sons he never had.", "I never thought Bannen could smell so good..."
Catelyn saying, "Promise me, Bran!" over and over. Dream-Cat's such a troll.
"Boy" being like, "Wait for it..." Creepy bastard.
2865	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-22	These things that made me smirk are probably very personal because I pay too much attention but...
At Bannen's funeral, Rast says 'he'll dine with potatoes and lavaros...' at least, that's what I heard, because there was a brief pause, until he continued and I realized he said 'laugh at us dying in the snow.' I was thinking wtf are lavaros? Something from Dorne?
When Craster grunts in the scene following that, a pig goes 'oink oink' before he speaks again, which makes it look like Craster is making pig sounds.
2866	Runaway Penguin	2013-04-22	Well, anything Edd...
And Tywin-Cersei dialogue. "You are still here?" and Tywin correcting her pronounciation /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

Everything about Olenna.Also, porridge plague. So silly. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />And Sansa's face. I think I had around the same reaction as she. What did Pod do?He apparently was so good in bed that prostitutes gave him a refund.
2874	Randyll Tarly	2013-04-22	The boy saying "He killed the others." while smiling at Theon being tied to the rack.
Tywin saying: "You still here I see..." and when he cleverly called her a failed mother for not manipulating from the begininng Joffrey as Margaery does in the moment.

2878	teemo	2013-04-22	Only Edd.  No one else is funny.  Especially not Ros.
2879	Alys Karstark	2013-04-22	Not exactly a "line", but I laughed at Missandei's expression towards Kraznys when he realized that Dany could understand Valyrian. Her wordless expression is telling her former master "You are soooo f***ed..."
2880	PatchfaceTheFool	2013-04-22	QoT: "Look little loves... a spider in the garden. Run along now. *sarcastic voice* Grow Strong!"
2881	Azor Ahoy!	2013-04-23	Yep, Joff laughing at the Targaryen crypts was probably the most funny scene of the episode.Is it just me or Joff is turning from a love-to-hate character into a comic-relief character?
2882	Will&Chrismom	2013-04-23	I loved the conversation between Ros and Varys, myself. "Prodigies are found in the oddest of places", in reference to Pod and his apparently masterful fornicatory skills.
2883	Ampris	2013-04-23	QoT to Varys: What happens when the non-existent bumps against the decrepitThis!Also when Tywin tells Cersei "I wish YOU could manipulate him."And I can't believe no one has mentioned this, but the QoT telling Cersei that sons yearn for the grave! Cersei's face is like, "I wanna be suspicious of your intentions when you say that" but the QoT looks so innocent and earnest. Meanwhile we know she's plotting Joff's death.
2884	The Monkey	2013-04-23	Beric: "So which of us is running?"

His "You're still masons, and carpenters, and peasants" (minus me getting the professions wrong) had the same effect on me.
2889	Mammothsbane	2013-04-23	Tywin metaphorically pimp slapping Cersei was the funniest line. Just an absolute "Sit down, shut up. Daddy's home" line. Laughed out loud
2890	Kasrith	2013-04-23	"I never thought Bannen could smell so good"Oh EddYes! We need more Edd!
2891	Ampris	2013-04-23	Forgot this one also -
QoT: "Why shouldn't I take an interest? She's an interesting girl."
Varys: "Is she?"
QoT: "No, not particularly."
This was surely a shout out to all the Sansa doubters
2892	Broken Fox	2013-04-23	QoT to Varys: What happens when the non-existent bumps against the decrepitThat was funny, not so much the line but Varys' reaction. He was like "WTF?" The first time I've seen him confused.
2893	Ser Dermett Corbray	2013-04-24	Anything that came out of QoT's mouth.
Edd.
Joffrey's macabre enthusiasm for the crypts.
2894	SummerSong	2013-04-24	Anything that came out of QoT's mouth.YES. She's a straight talking delight; we never know what she'll say next. She even stopped Varys in his tracks momentarily. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />  Love it.My husband got a kick out of the Night's Watch scene with Grenn and Dolorous Edd shoveling out the hog pen at Craster's:Grenn: "When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling."Edd: "Or the shit."Grenn: "They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it."Edd: "And getting attacked or killed or worse."Grenn: "And that. But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling."Edd: "Ah, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of me day." As a project manager who fights fires all day long, this hits close to home.
2895	Harrad	2013-04-24	The funniest line has to be "Dracarys." Cracks me up every time she says it. I use it at meetings when someone disagrees with me. They always look over their shoulders and brace for the flames.
2896	The Ghost of Winter	2013-04-25	Porridge Plague was a home run in my opinion. I thought it was real for a second too. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
2897	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-25	That was funny, not so much the line but Varys' reaction. He was like "WTF?" The first time I've seen him confused.Knowing Varys, it was probably an act. Let her feel high and mighty, and even a little bit arrogant, perhaps even insult him: as long as he gets what he wants, he's happy.

2898	Warhawk137	2013-04-25	Yep, Joff laughing at the Targaryen crypts was probably the most funny scene of the episode.Is it just me or Joff is turning from a love-to-hate character into a comic-relief character?I don't think that it's so much that he's now comic relief, it's just that he's so damn despicable that it hasn't just crossed the line, it's circled back around into being freakin' hilarious.  It's just that nothing he does really shocks us anymore (I think the scene with the prostitutes was the point at which we can say that became the case) that the only appropriate response at this point is to laugh.Not to mention that part of the reason book readers find him funny now is because we're gleefully anticipating his ultimate fate, so I think that's a factor - we laugh because every horrible thing he does just means that we know it will be that much sweeter when it happens.
2899	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-25	I'd put some spoiler tags around that last part.
2900	Timotheus	2013-04-25	Olenna Tyrell being sarcastic about House Tyrell's words "Growing Strong".
2901	Lady Arwen	2013-04-25	The "nonexistent bumping into the decrepit" line. I was in tears.
2902	TomBadgerlock	2013-04-25	"Aeron Brightflame they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon!...he was wrong". Jack Gleeson's...glee is just extraordinary. 
Also "you're still here". 
And Gendry's "I'd have some" and the BWB just ignoring him.
2903	GoodGuyA	2013-04-25	QoT's comment about Sansa not being "particularly interesting" was hysterical! Certainly reflected my views as a reader, but things have gotten mighty more interesting now that I'm watching. I am actually invested in Sansa's fate because of the people vying over her.
2904	towerofjoy	2013-04-25	I loved when Thoros offered Arya blackstrap rum. Her grimace and "ugh" was so cute.
2905	Kasrith	2013-04-25	And Gendry's "I'd have some" and the BWB just ignoring him.I don't think they ignored him, Thoros tossed the bag over to the archer who was closer to Gendry.. They just didn't need to show us him getting it.
2906	DemonKing	2013-04-29	I liked Varys talking about LF: "He's the kind of man that would burn the world to the ground just as long as he could be king of the ashes."
2907	teemo	2013-04-21	This was a hit last season.  Ideally, it's a thread where no complaint is too big or too small and no one will harass you for it; a venting area.  If it really bugs you to see people nitpick, this thread probably isn't for you.
I actually don't have a whole lot of nitpicks because the show is just now so radically different from the book with a huge amount of made up scenes, but I can't help but still hate how LF is portrayed as a complete idiot.
2908	Malgarroth	2013-04-22	Okay, here goes.
Now usually I like Varys' scenes, in-fact he's one of my favorite characters in either the book or show. I also think Conleith Hill is incredibly talented, his scene with the QoT was brilliant...
But.
Didn't his speech about being cut seem a little... forced? I don't know what I was expecting from the scene but something about the way he delivered it just didn't sit well with me.
2909	Roose Seal	2013-04-22	Didn't his speech about being cut seem a little... forced? I don't know what I was expecting from the scene but something about the way he delivered it just didn't sit well with me.I liked the scene but it came out of a left field a little."Ah Tyrion! I was just about to tell you about when I was cut!"It wasn't the story in and of itself that felt forced but I felt like it didn't come up organically.
2910	BillBones	2013-04-22	Okay, here goes.Now usually I like Varys' scenes, in-fact he's one of my favorite characters in either the book or show. I also think Conleith Hill is incredibly talented, his scene with the QoT was brilliant...But.Didn't his speech about being cut seem a little... forced? I don't know what I was expecting from the scene but something about the way he delivered it just didn't sit well with me.Agreed, it did seem a bit rushed. Might be he was very eager to get the box open or whatever, but he seemed really stressed while delivering the speech.
2911	JCrowley90	2013-04-22	I felt the same way as the scene was playing out initially, it was only when we got to see what was in the box that Varys' reason for suddenly deciding to monologue made sense.
2912	Delmas	2013-04-22	Dosent Tywins wrist get tired?
I guess the lannisters have really strong wrists, Tywin from Writting, Jaimie from sword fighting, and Tyrion from whackin it.

2913	SerMixalot	2013-04-22	Nitpicks big and small
1. Character Assasinaton of LF, everyone seems to know his plans
2. Ros, blech
3. hmmm not much else-will have to think on it.
Awesome episode
2914	Roose Seal	2013-04-22	Tiny nitpick:
In the same scene you have Tywin pronouncing Tyrell as "tyrr-ELL" and Cersei pronouncing it "TY-rell". Which is it!
2915	Loras Stan	2013-04-22	I don't know if it's a minor nitpick or not, but leaving Willas out of the Tyrell household is going to make things really complicated later on. Since if Loras as the Heir to Highgarden he will be less likely to join the Kingsguard.
I knew it was coming but I'm still incredibly annoyed.
2916	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	-Agree with the Tyrell/TYrell thing. Make up your mind, Lannisters!
-Oh, and Theon calling Ned his real father keeps bugging me for some reason
-My biggest gripe of the episode is that we didn't get Mormont's last words to Samwell.
2917	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	Finally somewhere where I can bitch and whine all I want.
1. Brienne saying "You sound like a bloody woman".
2. Tyrion trusting Varys too much.
3. Varys having the sorcerer. seriously WTF?!
4. Mormont didn't say his last words. I don't know if this is a nitpick. But it was kind of disappointing.
5. Ros being smarter than Varys.
6. Podrick's joke...
7. As much as I enjoyed the history and Joffrey, the Targaryens being buried.
8. Theon admitting that he did the wrong choice. It was touching. But it is too early!!! He should be totally broken when he admits it! And I didn't like that he called Ned he's real father.
9. No Willas /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
10. Varys giving the QoT the idea of marrying Sansa to some Tyrell.
11. Not having The Hound's badass quote:
"For the night is dark and full of terrors."
"This cave is dark too, but I'm the terror here."
It better be in the next episode.
Well, that's pretty much it. Other than that it was a fucking awesome episode.
ETA: I wrote a pretty long list, didn't I?

2918	piratesswoop	2013-04-22	Tiny nitpick:In the same scene you have Tywin pronouncing Tyrell as "tyrr-ELL" and Cersei pronouncing it "TY-rell". Which is it!Agree, especially since their lines were directly following each other.Also hated Brienne's "You sound like a bloody woman" line, especially since it seems so out of character. Reminds me of the line with Asha/Yara calling Theon a cunt. So OOC.
2919	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	Okay, here goes.Didn't his speech about being cut seem a little... forced? I don't know what I was expecting from the scene but something about the way he delivered it just didn't sit well with me.1.

2921	Elba the Intoner	2013-04-22	Finally somewhere where I can bitch and whine all I want.1. Brienne saying "You sound like a bloody woman".Thank you!  I am so glad to see this mentioned this line that Brienne said to Jaime.  I love the Brienne-Jaime story this season and the actors are perfect.  But, the Brienne who had that very nice moment with Cat last season where she tells her that she has a "woman's courage" would not say something like this.Also, now Ros, Varys and Olenna know that LF is interested in Sansa and was going to try and take her to the Eyrie.  So, how are they going to handle the search for her after the purple wedding when Sansa completely disappears?  I don't buy that absolutely no one, including Varys and Olenna, is going to wonder if LF took her and got her to the Eyrie somehow, especially after word starts to get out that LF's long lost daughter that nobody ever knew he has shows up with him there.Otherwise, it was a great episode and I really enjoyed it.

2922	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	I loathe the handling of the sansa situation.
So LF sets up the tyrell alliance then varys goes to share plans freely with the tyrells.  Come on, thos is like high school, and ros is starting to vex me horribly again.
2923	Queen of Whores	2013-04-22	- The delivery of Varys' monologue seemed off.
- Varys' darker side has been shown too early.
- Everyone know's Littlefinger's plans.
- Everyone keeps referring to Lord Baelish as Littlefinger. 
- The Tyrell's didn't come up with the marriage proposal on their own.
- Theon was shown too regretful too soon.
- Bran's scene was too short to be anything else than pointless.
- Brienne's incredibly out of character line.
- Tyrion didn't really need to be in this episode.
- Too much Margaery and Joffrey, not enough Arya.
- The sack of Astapor should have been much longer.
2924	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	Ugh, in the show, ive begun to root against robb and the north
2925	Warrior Queen	2013-04-22	I have one little nitpick. It wasn't from this episode but since we only have a nitpick topic for this episode i'm just going to post it here. 
I believe this was in episode 1. When Tywin was telling Tyrion that he would never give him Casterly Rock. 
Twyin said 'I have 7 kingdoms to rule, and 3 of them are in open rebellion'
The only kingdoms rebelling are the North and the Stormlands. The Riversland are in open rebellion, but the Riverlands are not a kingdom! 
It kinda annoyed me (i know it's nitpicking)
Correct me if i'm wrong tho.
2926	Roose Seal	2013-04-22	- The sack of Astapor should have been much longer.That was a little disappointing yeah but I've come to accept that we'll never really get real battle scenes but *start of battle* *fade to black* *aftermath* instead because of budget constraints. At least this season feels much more balanced in terms of "wow" scenes compared to last season where nothing great happened until Blackwater.
2927	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	I have one little nitpick. It wasn't from this episode but since we only have a nitpick topic for this episode i'm just going to post it here.I believe this was in episode 1. When Tywin was telling Tyrion that he would never give him Casterly Rock.Twyin said 'I have 7 kingdoms to rule, and 3 of them are in open rebellion'The only kingdoms rebelling are the North and the Stormlands. The Riversland are in open rebellion, but the Riverlands are not a kingdom!It kinda annoyed me (i know it's nitpicking)Correct me if i'm wrong tho.Maybe he is refering to the Iron Islands?
2928	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	I have one little nitpick. It wasn't from this episode but since we only have a nitpick topic for this episode i'm just going to post it here.

2929	boojam	2013-04-22	Okay, here goes.Now usually I like Varys' scenes, in-fact he's one of my favorite characters in either the book or show. I also think Conleith Hill is incredibly talented, his scene with the QoT was brilliant...But.Didn't his speech about being cut seem a little... forced? I don't know what I was expecting from the scene but something about the way he delivered it just didn't sit well with me.It's straight from the book and I thought Conleth Hill nailed.However the deal about him obtaining his 'cutter' , was not in the book, I don't remember.The dialog about how he was cut , on the page , seemed GRRM  was telling us something about the Illyrio-varys mystery conspiracy which seems to be something bigger than just getting revenge on your old tormentor.In fact it seems to involve Tyrion and Dany and something Varys and Illyrio have figured about about the Red God and the Great Other.
2930	Hear me Meow	2013-04-22	I have one little nitpick. It wasn't from this episode but since we only have a nitpick topic for this episode i'm just going to post it here.I believe this was in episode 1. When Tywin was telling Tyrion that he would never give him Casterly Rock.Twyin said 'I have 7 kingdoms to rule, and 3 of them are in open rebellion'The only kingdoms rebelling are the North and the Stormlands.

After the BoBWB though, only two of those seven kingdoms are in revolt, not three. The iron islands and the isles around Dragonstone are not kingdoms.So the show got it wrong. Doh.The seven are;DorneReachWesterlandsValeStormlandsRiverlandsNorth

At least this season feels much more balanced in terms of "wow" scenes compared to last season where nothing great happened until Blackwater.I kept track of the time remaining when it got the 10 min. mark I knew they had to get "Dracarys" into something around 10 to 11 min.Well it was an excellent compact-ti-fication and pulled in all the relevant elements.If I remember in the books , here is another case , on the page, of 'fate to black' , if I remember right the bulk sack of Astapor is (like the two upcoming battles)told in summary form.Well shall see what they do with the upcoming action.

2933	Er Rn	2013-04-22	I agree with the complaints about Varys. His speech seemed to come out of nowhere and then when he had the sorcerer in the box, it was really odd.
And yes, everyone and their brother knows what Littlefinger is up to.
2934	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	Yes, the riverlands are a 'kingdom' in that they are one of the 'seven kingdoms.' After the BoBWB though, only two of those seven kingdoms are in revolt, not three. The iron islands and the isles around Dragonstone are not kingdoms.So the show got it wrong. Doh.The seven are;DorneReachWesterlandsValeStormlandsRiverlandsNorthThe Riverlands were NOT a kingdom. It was The Kingdom of The Isles and Rivers (Iron Islands and Riverlands). Some Hoare (I don't remember which one) invaded the Rverlands and made them part of the Kingdom of the Iron Islands. The 7 kingdoms before Aegon where:The Kingdom of the North.The Kingdom of the Rock (Westerlands)The Kingdom of Vale and Sky (the Vale)The Kingdom of the Reach.The Kingdom of the Stormlands.The Kingdom of Isles and Rivers.Dorne.
2935	Sansa in the North	2013-04-22	I actually like the scene with the sorcerer.
My only real problem with this episode is Brienne's line. Cat pushing Bran out of the tree was kind of weird, too, but it's a dream, so I guess it's supposed to be like that. Bran's dreams were weird in the books, too.
2936	Delmas	2013-04-22	I know that we are not supposed to comment on other people nit picks, but people complaining at brienne callin jamie a women seems a little thick skulled.  Brienne was trying to get Jamie to stop acting like a huge bitch, she likely just said what she thought would make him start eating n what not.
2937	Dragonstoned	2013-04-22	I have one little nitpick.

The Stormlands have been back in the fold since Blackwater.edit: just read Darth Zyroth, yeah Tywin's comment is off, bad history - not sure about the Iron Islands cos Tywin hasn't got the letter of alliance offer from Balon yet.

2938	Warrior Queen	2013-04-22	Maybe he is refering to the Iron Islands?Of course! It must be. Thank you! I totally forgot about that (How could I!) I guess it's because they don't really show them that much (only Theon) and it has been a couple years since I last read A Storm of Swords.The Riverlands were one of the original seven kingdoms (controlled from the Iron Islands by Harren the Black).The three kingdoms in rebellion are the North, Riverlands, and Dragonstone.  The Stormlands have been back in the fold since Blackwater.But Dragonstone is not a kingsdom. Dragonstone is part of the Crownlands which is a constituent region. Right?I suppose you are kinda right about the Stormlands being back in the fold, but doesn't Stannis have most Lords from the stormlands supporting him?  So some of the lords in that kingdom are still rebelling.http://gameofthrones...boundaries.html

2939	Darth Zyroth	2013-04-22	I think you're still right. Because the North, the Riverlands, the Iron Islands and Dragonstone are in revelion. But Dragonstone is not a Kingdom, and the Iron Islands and Riverlands where one. The Stormlands are not in revelion anymore since the BBB. So that would really be only 2: Notrh, and Isles and Rivers. Unless Tywin is counting the latter as 2. But makes no sense! But then Tywin doesn't know his history in the show. I mean in season 2 he didn't know that Aegon rode Balerion, Visenya rode Vhagar, and Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Come on!! is common knowledge and history you people!!! I'm pretty sure Tywin should know his history. Did he say that about the 3 kingdoms in the book? I don't remember.

2942	Gannicus	2013-04-22	I thought it was a great episode and I loved most of the changes.
But I was disappointed we didn't hear the Old Bear's last wish.
2943	Winterfellian	2013-04-22	That LF's subtlety is all but gone now. Am surprised he hasn't come up with the Westerosi version of twitter to keep everyone informed of his moves.
How they are handling Sansa story.
Ros, but what else is new?
That they are still going in about Pod the marvelous lover and former virgin
I would have appreciated more build up for the 2 highlights this season- Craster's Keep and Dracarys. One was too messy and the Old Bear deserved better than just dying without his last words. Too late for this but is a shame we didn't get to see Sam the Slayer. I know this can come up in the future, but I ike that before he died the Old Bear voiced out loud that the true enemy isn't the wildings, something that resonates later on when Jon reaches the same conclusion in ADWD.
As for Dracarys, I just would have appreciated if they had taken more effort into actually making the audience believe that Dany was giving away a dragon. As it was, I watched the episode with 3 non readers and they all figured out eary on Dany's entire plan
Theon talking about Ned being his real father. Too early in the story, besides even completely broken Theon never thought of Ned that way.
2944	Warrior Queen	2013-04-22	I loved those mentions. I love when they mention history because I love the history of ASOIAF, and Joffrey was great during those scenes. But I don't like that Targaryens are buried. They are supposed to be burned.It was kinda odd because Joffrey did say: Over there in that urn are the ashes of Aerion Targaryen, Aerion brightflame they called him. But then he says: Do you want to see where the last Targaryen's are burried. But we also see A LOT of urns in the background, so most of them must have been cremated.  Joffrey then says: My father was going to have them burned and thrown into the blackwater, but the high Septon convinced him otherwise.To me it seems like all the previous Targaryens were burned and put in urns (thats why there are so many) and that just the last generation was given tombs because the high septon wanted this. Maybe the Septon though he was honoring the last Targaryens that way? It's just a show thing anyway.

2945	Dragonstoned	2013-04-22	More of an observation than a nit but the BWB (Beric and Thoros at least) were more solemn in the books.  They're a bit smiley and happy in the show, although it hardly matters.
As long as it doesn't stop us getting Arya's question to Thoros about bringing back a man with no head, and Thoros to Brienne 'some knights are dark and full of terror'.

Right?I suppose you are kinda right about the Stormlands being back in the fold, but doesn't Stannis have most Lords from the stormlands supporting him?  So some of the lords in that kingdom are still rebelling.Yeah I'm not sure what Dragonstone counts as (should know considering it's my name), it's not part of the Crownlands as Stannis's title was Lord of the Narrow Sea.  Guess just a standalone territory that's less than a kingdom, same as the Riverlands.After Blackwater the storm lords either pledged loyalty to the crown or were executed for not bending the knee.  The only ones who continued to support Stannis were the soldiers who got away with him and the five hundred or so men stuck in Storm's End.  Post-BW his strength was nearly all from lords sworn to Dragonstone.  Unclear what the setup is in the show.

2947	boojam	2013-04-22	O yeah!
When the Seven Hells are the dragons going to get named!
2948	Buckwheat	2013-04-22	I liked the scene but it came out of a left field a little."Ah Tyrion! I was just about to tell you about when I was cut!"It wasn't the story in and of itself that felt forced but I felt like it didn't come up organically.I totally agree about that and it was the only thing that bothered me during the watching.
2949	MaHaBone	2013-04-22	General Mega-Pick:
The show seems to waste to much time reinforcing and repeating details, themes, trends over and over:
-Maegory is playing Joffrey like a fiddle.  That was amde crystal clear in the crossbow scene.
-Varys has many spies.  Got it.  Don't need to see how he collects every morsal of information.
Also, wouldn't Littlefinger's spies notice Ros haveing luncheons with Varys?
Varys getting his old sorceor pal FedEx'd to Kings Landing?
Did Ramsey stage that whole escape just so Theon could have a tearful confession?
Suprised they bothered with the "Sansa marrying a Tyrell" subplot since it ends up pretty stillborn in the book.
Where the hell are they going with all this Poderick Payne business???
The Sept set was pretty epic.
Daenerys's scene was worth the wait.
2950	Bob the Fiddler	2013-04-22	The Iron Islands are the third kingdom in revolt.
2951	StarkDragon	2013-04-22	Tiny nitpick:In the same scene you have Tywin pronouncing Tyrell as "tyrr-ELL" and Cersei pronouncing it "TY-rell". Which is it!When given the option of Tywin or Cersei, Tywin is right.I always hated the Ty-rell pronunciation.EditWhere the hell are they going with all this Poderick Payne business???Where they didn't go with Tormund, probably.Personally I think a man prattling about his lance as far less abrasive.2. Tyrion trusting Varys too much.3. Varys having the sorcerer. seriously WTF?!That scene was incredibly forced. Almost as if Varys had planned for Tyrion to come,for him to spill his terribly sad childhood, and then wuh-lah, there is the despicable sorcerer. What a conspicuous set of circumstances,that lead to showing Tyrion he can trust Varys,(even though Varys will do nothing to avail him,)as Varys presumably trusts him?

2952	Roose Seal	2013-04-22	Suprised they bothered with the "Sansa marrying a Tyrell" subplot since it ends up pretty stillborn in the book.Sansa is kind of the audience's eyes in the capital. They are building her (and the audience's) hopes up with this Loras marriage business only so they can shatter them better when her wedding to Tyrion is announced.
2953	Buckwheat	2013-04-22	Varys getting his old sorceor pal FedEx'd to Kings Landing?/rofl2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rofl:' /> I agree about that, seems pretty silly. I really wonder where they are going with it because it looks nonsensical at this point.
2954	PatrickStormborn	2013-04-22	I guess they included the sorceror to provide Varys with a reason for providing the story of his cutting. They should have just included it last season.I know that we are not supposed to comment on other people nit picks, but people complaining at brienne callin jamie a women seems a little thick skulled.  Brienne was trying to get Jamie to stop acting like a huge bitch, she likely just said what she thought would make him start eating n what not. It was misogynistic and out of character. As for Dracarys, I just would have appreciated if they had taken more effort into actually making the audience believe that Dany was giving away a dragon. As it was, I watched the episode with 3 non readers and they all figured out eary on Dany's entire planIn all fairness, it would have been obvious in the books too if readers waited a week between Dany deciding to trade Drogon and making the trade.In the books I didn't really think she'd make the trade... But I didn't want to be optimistic incase the trade was actually made. My sister, a non-reader, seemed to have the same impression I did, so I think D&D actually pulled this one off pretty well.

2955	MaHaBone	2013-04-22	I didn't mind Brienne's "woman" jab at Jamie, amd personally, I didn't think it was out of character.  I'd echo what Delmas said, that she was using Jamie's own mysogyny to get under his skin.  Plus Brienne's got complex gender issues, no one can deny that.
2956	Sansa in the North	2013-04-22	I know that we are not supposed to comment on other people nit picks, but people complaining at brienne callin jamie a women seems a little thick skulled.  Brienne was trying to get Jamie to stop acting like a huge bitch, she likely just said what she thought would make him start eating n what not.But why would hearing that he sounds like a woman make Jaime eat? I've always thought that out of all the men in Westeros Jaime is one of the most, if not the most feminist. He grew up with Cersei, he knowns how hard women have it and what they are capable of. And during the course of five books he doesn't say, think or do anything misogynistic. The thing that got Jaime to eat in the books was Brienne telling him that he is a coward. Here she compares him to a woman, implying that all women are cowards who "whine and give up when confronted with the real world", which is sexist. And Jaime knows this isn't true, so why would that make him eat anyway?

2957	Kasrith	2013-04-22	About LF's plans, we're still ep4. I think he's going to be forced to leave by himself (perhaps even next episode after seeing that preview and Sansa watching the ship leaving) and then Dontos will come back into play. No one will know what's up
2958	zaphodbrx	2013-04-22	I actually don't have a whole lot of nitpicks because the show is just now so radically different from the book with a huge amount of made up scenes, but I can't help but still hate how LF is portrayed as a complete idiot. Yea I agree. show!Littlefinger is a bumbling idiot.In season 1, he spent 90% of his time training whores.He spent season 2 being rude to noble women ( eg. Cersei 'power is power', Catelyn, Margery )And in season 3 everyone knows what he is up to, like ALL the time.He's not subtle or intriguing in the slightest. Just stupid.Oh and he apparently keeps the royal ledgers in the brothel and does all his work there. Probably eats and sleeps there as well. Can you imagine what this would look like to outsiders? What if a braavosi banker turned up and asked to inspect the royal ledgers right away, what would he say. Uhh, hmm.. they're being kept in a well guarded location, heh heh..

2960	cybobbie	2013-04-22	Tiny nitpick:In the same scene you have Tywin pronouncing Tyrell as "tyrr-ELL" and Cersei pronouncing it "TY-rell". Which is it!It was funny because I've noticed it when I watched the first time and wondered why they did it I mean they probably did that scene loads of times.-Oh, and Theon calling Ned his real father keeps bugging me for some reason-My biggest gripe of the episode is that we didn't get Mormont's last words to Samwell.It was really strange to see Theon considering Ned his real father, touching but very strange. Had to watch again the recording episode to be sure that he really did say it, I mean it's touching but don't feel right, specially at this point because it was kind of out of place to see him regretful so soon.As you I missed the final scene with Old Bear and Sam, not that it was important for the show, but as a reader fan I missed it.- Everyone know's Littlefinger's plans.- Everyone keeps referring to Lord Baelish as Littlefinger.I second that, the character is becoming too weak in the show :/I didn't mind Brienne's "woman" jab at Jamie, amd personally, I didn't think it was out of character.  I'd echo what Delmas said, that she was using Jamie's own mysogyny to get under his skin.  Plus Brienne's got complex gender issues, no one can deny that.It didn't bother me as well, I've already posted in another discussion that for me it was a way for her to get back o him in the woman role comments.Finally I think that the audience already got the point that Marg is working Joffrey very well, so we can have a break from the scenes between those two.
2961	Winterfellian	2013-04-22	I guess they included the sorceror to provide Varys with a reason for providing the story of his cutting. They should have just included it last season.It was misogynistic and out of character.In all fairness, it would have been obvious in the books too if readers waited a week between Dany deciding to trade Drogon and making the trade.In the books I didn't really think she'd make the trade... But I didn't want to be optimistic incase the trade was actually made. My sister, a non-reader, seemed to have the same impression I did, so I think D&D actually pulled this one off pretty well.I didn't mean it in terms of time, but maybe some scene with just Dany and Drogo the day before that indicated that Dany was second guessing herself wondering if she was doing the right thing, making it seem that she was thinking about giving Drogon or something like that. Anyway I realize is a minor nitpick because the scene was really good.
2962	teemo	2013-04-22	No one will probably agree with me, but I can't stand Lena Headey's portrayal of Cersei at all.  It was a little bit better this episode, probably because I think the dialogue between her and Tywin in their made-up scene was pretty spot-on, but I just don't feel like the actress understands her at all. I also don't think she's that great of an actress (yeah, she is better than Clarke, Harington, Turner, Madden, but she's overrated imo).  I know I'm in the huge minority since I don't even know anyone who feels this way, but for whatever reason her portrayal irks me.  They missed a huge opportunity by not giving Mormont his last words.  The writers grab onto every chance they can to have cheesy writing, so why they would decide not to let a man give his touching last words before he dies is beyond weird.  It was a great opportunity because how else now are viewers going to be reminded that Jeor is Jorah's father?  I know plenty of people who forgot/don't know that connection, and they could have placed it perfectly right here.  If timed right, they could just cut to Jorah's face at the end of the scene to emphasize it.  From Jeor to Jorah.  What a missed opportunity.  Shame.I agree with everyone about Varys' story coming out of nowhere.  Actually, it stuck out like a sore thumb.  It was like, "yo sup tyrion let me tell you this story how I was cut."  ?!?!?!?!  Awkward writing, but Conleth Hill handled it well as usual.I like Diana Rigg and looooveee QoT, but I don't know, I'm starting to find her irritating.  She talks so much about farting and chamberpots and she's nothing like I really pictured personality-wise.  I feel they dumbed her down because of the Dowager Countess.Four whores thinking a virgin is so great that they get together and decide not to pay him is ludicrous...it's ludicrous with one whore - but four???  Come on...Littlefinger was "too distracted" to care about the whores not getting paid, yet scared the shit out of Ros last season for being a buzzkill for the customers.  Sure, okay...what a trope....It's annoying how much D&D love Ros, like she's the Daryl Dixon of ASOIAF or something.  Her whole "moving up in the world" scene with Shae was idiotic and now she can read, is an executive assistant to a pimp and escorts him around town...wtf?  How did this even happen???Bran scenes are just pointless and I'm sick of seeing dead or soon to be dead Starks in his dreams.

2963	Young Nan	2013-04-22	I didn't like Theon's remorseful confession to Ramsay, it was too soon, and was out of the blue.
In the books I was very moved by his remorse after seeing him be broken and then try to redeem himself; on screen it felt out of place and didn't have the same emotional impact as it did in the books.  
Also, Littlefinger is not being very subtle.  Last season when they introduced Ser Dontos, I thought he was going to contact Sansa, but then LF just approached her directly, which is idiotic and out of character, and also renders the whole Dontos introduction in season 2 pointless.

2965	David Selig	2013-04-22	Also, Littlefinger is not being very subtle.That's quite an understatement. /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />He's never been subtle on the show, but ever since the second season, he's so incompetent and "in your face" all the time, it's a wonder how any of his plans works at all. Thankfully he wasn't in the episode so I didn't have to endure Gillen's overacting...
2966	Young Nan	2013-04-22	+1 to everything Schala said about Ros.  and the whole "podrick is so awesome in bed that whores won't take his money" story.  
Everytime I see D&D say "we really wanted to do X scene but we didn't have enough time/budget/other excuse" I think- then why introduce an extra whore character who seems to get more screentime each episode than all of the characters we actually give a shit about?
the primary audience for this show is the "boobies, knights, swords, cool!" viewer base, so I guess that's where they're going with it, its just a bummer.
2967	teemo	2013-04-22	I didn't like Theon's remorseful confession to Ramsay, it was too soon, and was out of the blue.In the books I was very moved by his remorse after seeing him be broken and then try to redeem himself; on screen it felt out of place and didn't have the same emotional impact as it did in the books.  Actually, I have to agree.  It felt forced and too soon, like "hey look at this redemption arc!!" In the books I remember Theon's thought about how he should have been with Robb at the RW when he was completely broken down and mentally gone.  That was heartbreaking and not forceful.  I wouldn't call it a terrible addition, but it was definitely not the greatest.The show lacks any kind of subtlety, honestly, which is something I love about the books.

2969	teemo	2013-04-22	I agree about the Pod thing. If it's mentioned again next week, I'm gonna lose my shit haha.I actually think it will be...watch it be an ongoing joke for the rest of the season, especially every time Tyrion and Bronn are around Pod.
2970	Young Nan	2013-04-22	I actually think it will be...watch it be an ongoing joke for the rest of the season, especially every time Tyrion and Bronn are around Pod.ugh,  I know it will be, and it's so annoying.  "pod is such a sexmachine, har har" is going to be the "fun times with tyrion and bronn" joke of the season, even though it isn't really that funny in the first place.
2971	Penguin king	2013-04-22	Just wanna repeat what people have said about Brienne's "you're acting like a woman line"  It was kinda misogynistic and not really something I feel book Brienne would say. I like Gwendoline Christie's portrayal of the character, but I don't think the writers always hit the mark.
2972	Penguin king	2013-04-22	ugh,  I know it will be, and it's so annoying.  "pod is such a sexmachine, har har" is going to be the "fun times with tyrion and bronn" joke of the season, even though it isn't really that funny in the first place.I'm still clinging on to the slim hope that there's a plot point hidden in there, because as a joke it's really not working.
2973	shiola	2013-04-22	WHERE DANY'S STORYLINE FUCKING GOES FROM HERE.
Dracarys was SO cool, and she has a huge fucking army.  And now she's just going to..... chill?  Liberate cities?  HOW will that translate to TV?

She didn't honestly believe it, but she knew he'd buy it and she wanted to say anything to help him.
2975	Winterfellian	2013-04-22	WHERE DANY'S STORYLINE FUCKING GOES FROM HERE.Dracarys was SO cool, and she has a huge fucking army.  And now she's just going to..... chill?  Liberate cities?  HOW will that translate to TV?Am really curiuos to see how they would handle this since most nonreaders are expecting her to head back to Westeros at this point now that she's got an army. My guess is that they will maybe have her pillage and conquer cities to raised enough money for a navy fleet. In the episode the army is marching afoot and there's no way they are ging to fit in her small ship. So Dany's new obstacle between her and Westeros is going to be a fleet.
2976	PatrickStormborn	2013-04-22	Dany's story is going to be the same as it was in A Storm of Swords: march towards Westeros, liberating cities and plundering resources for her war for the Iron Throne.

I like Gwendoline Christie's portrayal of the character, but I don't think the writers always hit the mark.I could be wrong, but it seemed as though she was giving Jaime a taste of his medicine. I think it was supposed to be ironic in the sense that she wasn't being serious, illustrating how foolish his misogyny sounds. It did catch me off guard immediately though.
2978	kephv	2013-04-22	Mormont dying without saying his last words -- though maybe he somehow survives a while longer and next episode he'll tell Green or Edd.Lack of dialogue from the books. This really sucks -- Jaime and Brienne, the Hound and the outlaws. They should've used more dialogue from the books. Woudl've made it a whole lot better.I know they're on a tight budget but even so, I thought the action scenes were horrible. At least two NW brothers just stood there while everyone was dying. That and they could've had a few more slavers around to make Dany's victory look a bit more compelling. I agree about the Pod thing. Worst show-only plot element so far, and that's saying something considering all the shitty stuff they came up with last season.If it's mentioned again next week, I'm gonna lose my shit haha.I agree about the Pod thing. I have no idea where the hell they're planning on taking this. My only thought is that it's nowhere at all; it's just some played out joke that needs to die.
2979	wandering	2013-04-22	I felt the same way as the scene was playing out initially, it was only when we got to see what was in the box that Varys' reason for suddenly deciding to monologue made sense.Exactly.
2980	Ser Loudmouth	2013-04-22	This was a good episode. I liked most of it and found it to be reasonably faithfull to the books (al least by the current standards of the series). There were just two additions which really bothered me:- the overly long (and so far pointless) gag about Podrick and his quality as a lower. I wanted to groan.- the scene with Varys and the sorcerer. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!It was good they showed him tell the tale. This is a well-proven narrative technique: characters that have suffered some trauma in the past and are driven by revenge are often encountered in fiction. It makes the character more interesting and allows the audience to sympathise with him.But you don't let that character have his revenge right away! The revenge you want will be yours in time! that is the keyword. You need to let that plotline grow for a while.All the audience should have gotten from that scene is that Varys hates magic and has a burning (pun not intended) desire for revenge. Not that he has allready got his revenge. We don't know if that might not happen at a later date in the books.Besides, Varys doesn't hate that socreror in particular. He says it himself that he doesn't even remember the face. He hates magic in general

2981	A Real Dire Wolf	2013-04-22	Tiny nitpick:In the same scene you have Tywin pronouncing Tyrell as "tyrr-ELL" and Cersei pronouncing it "TY-rell". Which is it!I read somewhere that someone thought that was deliberate: Tywin correcting her, adding to the whole "not as smart as you think you are" thing.
2982	congokong	2013-04-22	Finally this thread is back in business.
*takes deep breath* Here we go...
I can't really "nitpick." It seemed that mostly the entire first half of last episode was just made up scenes that shouldn't have existed. I don't know what is going on anymore. Margery and Joffrey were only together in the book during their purple wedding. I know some scenes between such characters will be added for lack of POVs but this is too much. Margery is everywhere now.
The episode got pretty good starting with the scene where Craster is offed. That was when they started going back to the books. From there until the end was solid.
Overall I'd consider this show a poor adaption at this point. When I go back to season 1, I'm shocked at how faithful it was compared to now. By season 7 if TWOW is not out it may not be a big deal since D+D are just doing their own thing.
2983	Roboginger	2013-04-22	I know that we are not supposed to comment on other people nit picks, but people complaining at brienne callin jamie a women seems a little thick skulled.  Brienne was trying to get Jamie to stop acting like a huge bitch, she likely just said what she thought would make him start eating n what not.I agree, she was trying to get some life out of him.
2984	mafalda	2013-04-22	I didn't necessarily HATE Brienne's woman comment to Jaime... I just kind of tilted my head at it.  I understand that she was trying to insult Jaime and rile him up, but still. She could have totally said "baby" or "child" but I guess being called a woman is more insulting to some people, and Bri knows it.
My nitpicks are:
How LF is portrayed.
Ros getting way more screen time than she deserved. She was in S1 to soley serve the purpose of the shock/nudity scandal surrounding GoT. She no longer serves that purpose so why have her. Let's concentrate on the actually important characters. And why is it that she can read? Who taught her? A wayward maester who visited her brothel?? Then again, she did apparently sleep with Pycelle.
Podrick's Package is starting to become a pet peeve. If they mention it again next episode I will scream!
How LF is portrayed.
I wish they would have shaved Jaime's head. Nikolaj, your beautiful coif would have eventually grown back.
Not really relative to this episode or season, but the new Mountain.
They are ruining Stannis. I know, I know, he wasn't begging for the gumbo pot, he was begging for another Shadow Baby. But he was still BEGGING!
Shae and Sansa, BFF! Until my boyfriend is forced to marry you, apparently.
Mother fucking Littlefinger! I can't even, just, no! Especially that dumb scene last season where he's talking to Cat. Whatever.
And DD's stupidly obvious foreshadowing of every single thing. If viewers (the non bookies) don't know by now that Joff will die, then I don't know what. There have been two blatantly obvious hints of his upcoming death this season so far.
I'm sure I have more but this is all I can think of now /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

Some of the changes since then are probably necessary, but I'm not sure how anyone can argue for changes like "Pod Super stud" The show is still worth watching, but like you say, it's really doing it's own thing now.
2986	DaveSumm	2013-04-22	I don't quite understand how Theon is supposed to have circled around to the same building and not noticed. He's a pretty savvy guy, raised by Eddard no less. I reckon he's capable of knowing if he's going north east south or west, capable of recognising the same building, and for that matter, probably knows that there aren't any other large keeps as close to Deepwood Motte as it took them to apparently travel there.
And agree with all the pronounciation gripes; my big bugbear for the whole show. Send one email round agreeing on pronounciations - done. It isn't difficult.
2987	Ser Hollard	2013-04-22	WTF Pod story...why even?  I mean how...why....WTF?  It was dumb enough to put it in once, and a horrible mistake to mention it again. And I still hate Ros, because she's like a Mary Sue character who never belonged in the story to begin with.  How are we supposed to think LF is dangerous when EVERYONE KNOWS every plan he has, and even  "oh you came to the big city from the boondocks as a whore but 6 months later your the head madame at one of the most powerful men in the seven kingdoms brothel and so in the know that the head spymaster recruited you to **** someone in the executive production level of the show because that is the only reason for your continued existence...."sorry, just got rambling there.... Heck, maybe the actor playing Pod is banging someone in the production staff too, and they thought it was so funny they insisted it become a plotline.I really hate that they bring up the realistic and understandable point that they have to cut/edit things because showing them true to the books would take too long, only to waste time on inane bullshit that was never in the books and has little to no use for progressing the story even in the TV narrative.Oh, and as much as I liked the scene between Varys and Tyrion looking down at the captured sorcerer I was shouting at the screen: Oh you don't know if the magic was real or what the voice was?  I don't know, maybe you could ask the sorcerer if you ever found him...

2989	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	Yeh, only nit picks are stupid Pod recurring joke and also how they've made LF out to be a total idiot. ''oh he's so dangerous but i know all his plans anyway lol''
2990	tearloch	2013-04-22	I liked the scene but it came out of a left field a little."Ah Tyrion! I was just about to tell you about when I was cut!"It wasn't the story in and of itself that felt forced but I felt like it didn't come up organically.I think the scene fit in pretty nicely by the time you got to the end of it.  Tyrion is seeking revenge, and Varys displayed how revenge is sweetest when served up cold.  It did seem odd at first, but when he pulled the cover off the box, it made perfect sense.
2991	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	This is a very, very small gripe, but when Olenna mentioned the Siege of Storm's End, I was hoping that she would namedrop Stannis, so the audience is reminded of his sheer badassery.

2995	DragonLady214	2013-04-22	Thank you!  I am so glad to see this mentioned this line that Brienne said to Jaime.  I love the Brienne-Jaime story this season and the actors are perfect.  But, the Brienne who had that very nice moment with Cat last season where she tells her that she has a "woman's courage" would not say something like this.Also, now Ros, Varys and Olenna know that LF is interested in Sansa and was going to try and take her to the Eyrie.  So, how are they going to handle the search for her after the purple wedding when Sansa completely disappears?  I don't buy that absolutely no one, including Varys and Olenna, is going to wonder if LF took her and got her to the Eyrie somehow, especially after word starts to get out that LF's long lost daughter that nobody ever knew he has shows up with him there.Otherwise, it was a great episode and I really enjoyed it.I believe the reason she said "You sound like a bloody woman" is because in the previous episode when she asks him what he would do if he were a woman, Jamie replies "I would kill myself.  Thank God I am not".  So calling him a woman is probably the biggest insult she could have thrown at him.  IMHO of course.

2997	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	You're awesome.  Me too.Great minds think alike /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> But seriously, I'm worried that they're deliberately making Stannis more unlikable...
2998	FierceElite	2013-04-22	No one will probably agree with me, but I can't stand Lena Headey's portrayal of Cersei at all.  It was a little bit better this episode, probably because I think the dialogue between her and Tywin in their made-up scene was pretty spot-on, but I just don't feel like the actress understands her at all.

I know I'm in the huge minority since I don't even know anyone who feels this way, but for whatever reason her portrayal irks me. I haven't posted here this season because this thread hasn't been around. It's been the only thread for me the last 2 seasons. Not going to say too much, because basically everything worth bitching about in this episode has already been done. With that said, I absolutely agree about Lena. I've been saying this since season 1. Cersei isn't a soft-spoken monotone. Drives me crazy every time she..slowly...calmly...calculatingly...speaks. For this matter, most of the actors don't fit their roles. Whether it be a product of the acting, the change in storylines/motivations, or both. Jon Snow, Littlefinger, haven't liked the little that I've seen from Jojen or Meera, Tywin, Shae, Mance, Tormund, Stannis, Renly, Loras, Thoros (consolidation of characters), Sandor, "Yara"...hate them all. Beyond just not fitting the physical description, they just suck at playing otherwise interesting characters. It's one thing for an actor to make a character their own, but to change key components of what makes their character who/what they are...just frustrating and disappointing.
2999	mafalda	2013-04-22	Okay, here goes.Now usually I like Varys' scenes, in-fact he's one of my favorite characters in either the book or show. I also think Conleith Hill is incredibly talented, his scene with the QoT was brilliant...But.Didn't his speech about being cut seem a little... forced? I don't know what I was expecting from the scene but something about the way he delivered it just didn't sit well with me.Yes! It was way rushed and way too.. CASUAL. It really bugged me.Thank you!  I am so glad to see this mentioned this line that Brienne said to Jaime.  I love the Brienne-Jaime story this season and the actors are perfect.

Naturally, DD will just make something up.O yeah!When the Seven Hells are the dragons going to get named!I have no idea, but I completely forgot about the other two because they only ever show Drogon! WHY is CGI so expensive? Really, anyone who knows, please tell me.I did get bored with Olenna in the middle of her third sentence /ninja.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ninja:' />Always chamberpots and roses /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />Imagine you'd work for her and had to listen to that every day. Again and again. The scene inadvertedly got to be not about her sharp tongue and mind, but about a puffish. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />Lol, your post made me laugh! The only funny thing she said was "What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?" The rest of it I was kind of wishing for the main point of the conversation to be made. If I had to work for her I'd leave Highgarden entirely.No one will probably agree with me, but I can't stand Lena Headey's portrayal of Cersei at all.  It was a little bit better this episode, probably because I think the dialogue between her and Tywin in their made-up scene was pretty spot-on, but I just don't feel like the actress understands her at all. I also don't think she's that great of an actress (yeah, she is better than Clarke, Harington, Turner, Madden, but she's overrated imo).  I know I'm in the huge minority since I don't even know anyone who feels this way, but for whatever reason her portrayal irks me.  They missed a huge opportunity by not giving Mormont his last words.  The writers grab onto every chance they can to have cheesy writing, so why they would decide not to let a man give his touching last words before he dies is beyond weird.  It was a great opportunity because how else now are viewers going to be reminded that Jeor is Jorah's father?  I know plenty of people who forgot/don't know that connection, and they could have placed it perfectly right here.  If timed right, they could just cut to Jorah's face at the end of the scene to emphasize it.  From Jeor to Jorah.  What a missed opportunity.  Shame.I agree with everyone about Varys' story coming out of nowhere.  Actually, it stuck out like a sore thumb.  It was like, "yo sup tyrion let me tell you this story how I was cut."  ?!?!?!?!  Awkward writing, but Conleth Hill handled it well as usual.I like Diana Rigg and looooveee QoT, but I don't know, I'm starting to find her irritating.  She talks so much about farting and chamberpots and she's nothing like I really pictured personality-wise.  I feel they dumbed her down because of the Dowager Countess.Four whores thinking a virgin is so great that they get together and decide not to pay him is ludicrous...it's ludicrous with one whore - but four???  Come on...Littlefinger was "too distracted" to care about the whores not getting paid, yet scared the shit out of Ros last season for being a buzzkill for the customers.  Sure, okay...what a trope....It's annoying how much D&D love Ros, like she's the Daryl Dixon of ASOIAF or something.  Her whole "moving up in the world" scene with Shae was idiotic and now she can read, is an executive assistant to a pimp and escorts him around town...wtf?  How did this even happen???Bran scenes are just pointless and I'm sick of seeing dead or soon to be dead Starks in his dreams. I agree with you about Lena. Her portrayal is umm, well I think she's almost quite there but there's something missing about her. I can't quite pinpoint it. It was throughout S1 and most of S2... I'm only thinking she's improving because she's nailing Cersei's right amount of paranoia. My friend who has also read the books thinks she's pretty, but not pretty enough to play Cersei, and that the Queen of Westeros is supposed to be one of the most beautiful women as she was described in the books.when I first saw the mutiny at CK, I didn't have much thought on it because I was so caught up in the moment. But it was very messily done.. i watch the show with my bf who isn't a bookie and he thought the entire NW just turned evil and crazy and I had to explain that only a few of them turned crazy. And they just stabbed Mormont and left him there... no Sam talking to him, no last words, nothing. The non bookies don't even know that Jeor is Jorah's dad but I guess DD doesn't care. And no raven! My Old Bear deserved better /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />Dany, oh Dany! Amazing scene. My favorite scene from the whole series. But WHY hasn't she changed her clothes?? It didn't bug me last eppy when she wore the same outfit for a second eppy in a row, but it bugged me this time. Third episode, and a huge moment for her. They couldn't be bothered, they just threw a cape over her /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
3000	mafalda	2013-04-22	And I'm also sick of Bran's dreams too and Jojen obsessing about them. I did not like Bran's chapters and his screen time is boring me too. Even thought the tv Reeds are way cooler than the book Reeds. They were just strange!
3001	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	Just like Stephen Dillane's portrayal of Stannis, I think Lena's portrayal of Cersei is the right way to go. If she acted just like Cersei does in the books, she would just seem ridiculous, like an evil queen out of a children's movie. Rather than having Cersei being fiery and so blatantly awful, I feel it's more realistic if her demeanour is just ice-cold and bitter, rather than "MWUHAHAHAHA LOOK HOW EVIL I AM". It works for Joffrey, because he's a little brat, but it just wouldn't translate as well on the screen for Cersei, a more developed and well-rounded character. In the same way, if Dillane was as grouchy as book Stannis, and just kept hissing and snapping and glaring every single moment, it would look silly. I really dig the gritty attitude he displays while playing Stannis.
3002	The Red Maester	2013-04-22	Catelyn saying, "Promise Me, Promise Me"  - Ahem, that's Lyanna's line.
3003	teemo	2013-04-22	I don't even really find TV!Cersei that bitter and ice cold.  She seems more like a troubled mother who is scared of her son with a mean streak in her, and that's what the actress thinks as well.  Like when she got all shaken up over Joffrey killing the bastards (when she did it herself in the books).  I don't think she ever really acts all "MWUHAHA EVIL" when she walks around in the books....those are usually thoughts in her head.  She puts on an icy front.  
I agree with FierceElite about her monotonous, calculated voice.

3004	Reposado	2013-04-22	I know they're on a tight budget but even so, I thought the action scenes were horrible. At least two NW brothers just stood there while everyone was dying. That and they could've had a few more slavers around to make Dany's victory look a bit more compelling. .Always an issue. They to get the guys who do the figh choreography for the vikings.Id also say we sbould talk about the pod scene a d thevarys scenein this thread. Those trainwrecks cant be nitpicked
3005	lostinwesteros	2013-04-22	I'm so glad to see how many other people find the Pod scenes a horrible waste of time.  At first I thought it was cute, but then....ridiculous and pointless.  Is it supposed to be some sort of mystery?  They're leaving out key scenes to include these, and it hurts the show.I agree with what's been said about Margaery being in it entirely too much - what's the point?  We already know she's playing Joff like a pro, and even that isn't important to the plot at this point.  
	Spoiler  He's about to be murdered off, so why don't we just wait for the wedding feast?  We just need to see her show up at the wedding.  And, speaking of that, when are they going to do the Sansa hairnet thing?  Anyway, Margaery's 'wiles' aren't really needed until much later when she's wed Tommen and the whole thing with Cercei unraveling had started.  We've got plenty of time to get there. 
I also don't know why all of the Theon story line is coming out now.  They're making him one of the very main characters, just like they are Margaery, and that's not the story that the books tell.  Besides, 
	Spoiler  part of the shock value of finding Reek in ADWD is that we haven't seen him for a long time.  Then we do see him all of a sudden and he's unrecognizable, trying to kill a rat for food. 
Oh...and I agree with what's been said about the Varys scene being a little wierd and not essential to the story line.  If the message to Tyrion was to "Wait patiently, your time for revenge will come", then IMHO it could have been conveyed much more efficiently.  Varys is such a super character, I really like him, and I think he's been vastly under-used.  A waste of a good resource.I didn't realize I had so many little gripes until I started this post.  But....I agree with what someone said about D and D perhaps taking this and turning it into their own story, nor GRRM's.

Well, they need to show exactly how Theon turns into Reek. The books have the benefit of inner monologue, the show doesn't. Plus, it would be far more effective to show, rather than tell the viewer about Theon's torture. If they do things right, hopefully, they have one flaying scene which is absolutely brutal to watch, and then don't show Theon until the scene where he eats a rat.
3007	Relic	2013-04-22	I didn't realize I had so many little gripes until I started this post.  But....I agree with what someone said about D and D perhaps taking this and turning it into their own story, nor GRRM's.Look, they almost have to. There is no way GRRM will be finished with the book series before the show is off the air, so they have to beat their own path. Sadly, they aren't anywhere near as clever as GRRM.
3008	Newstar	2013-04-23	Can we get a consistent pronunciation of "Tyrell" already? It drove me to distraction when Cersei said "Tie-rell" and in the very next line Tywin said "Tirrell." So frustrating!
3009	Dove	2013-04-23	I like to think that he just was correcting Cersei's proncounciation. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />
3010	FattyPeon	2013-04-23	Im very annoyed at Theon calling Ned his father.Not because Theon would never say it, but because its bollocks! and we're supposed to think this is some kind of revelation for Theon. Ned was never a father to him! He's right to be bitter and angry about that!"Forced" is the perfect word for Varys monologue delivery. He should've been delivering that dialogue to Tyrion is a darker room, speaking softer and slower, more close-ups, maybe some glistening eyes. I mean come on.
3011	protar	2013-04-23	Things I didn't care for:Wizard-in-a-box. A pointless, self-indulgent waste of time which marred a chilling and well acted book scene.Follow up scene to Pod and the whores. I laughed the first time, but now it's time to shut up about it.Completely pointless Bran scene. I understand why they're struggling with Bran but that still doesn't excuse the fact that it will be half way through the season next week and he's done next to nothing. Perhaps his episode 2 material could have been split over episode 3 as well?No Mormont/Sam scene at the mutiny. But perhaps Sam will return to the ruins of Craster's and find Mormont bleeding out?
3012	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-23	Agree that the Bran scene was pointless, but in the show's defense, he does absolute jackshit for most of the novel. I was hoping that we instead get some backstory about Robert's Rebellion from the Reeds, but I doubt it, considering how Jojen mentioned that his father never spoke of the Rebellion.

3013	paddington	2013-04-23	I am finding the show hard to follow, an I've read the books a few times.  It's just leaping between PoV to quickly without really establishing anything. 
A good example of this is the Night Watch scenes, I don't really get the sense that they are scared and on the run from a huge army of wildings, and undead.  More just hungry and a bit cold.  Frankly the whole watch behind the wall arc has been reduced to the watch sitting around Crasters keep, moaning.
I enjoyed the meeting in the cave between the Hound and Dondarrion, the end with the unsullied, and the set for the temple was pretty great.

I was hoping that we instead get some backstory about Robert's Rebellion from the Reeds, but I doubt it, considering how Jojen mentioned that his father never spoke of the Rebellion.I get that, but I think spreading out some of his already existing material across episode 3 as well as 2 would have at least given the illusion that Bran is doing more than he is. Maybe end Bran's material in E2 with meeting the Reeds, then E3 gives the extra info on warging? Then he sits out episode 4 and does whatever he's doing in E5, with him falling out the tree as a lead in scene.
3015	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2013-04-23	All the Varys stuff seemed rushed this episode.
I liked the 'How I was cut' expose as it happened but it was pretty off-kilter how it started "Oh remember that conversation we were going to have a year ago?"
The wizard-in-a-box though? Nahhh - the scene needed more menace it for that to have worked as it should
The whole rapid trust of Lady Olenna was just too rushed I think. The back and forth between them was great but the ending? Oh now we are BFFs and going to tell each other everything?
The weakest scene in the whole ep for me was Bran's scene. It seemed to just be there to show he was still alive without actually pushing his story.

3016	Elba the Intoner	2013-04-23	The more I think about it, the more perplexed I am about why Varys would even go to Olenna in the first place to tell her about LF wanting to take Sansa with him. Why wouldn't he go right to the Lannisters about this? He's good buddies with Tyrion now so he could have easily told him. It makes Varys look really indispensable to them by telling them this bit of news, and it would neutralize LF's power in one fell swoop since the Lannisters would realize that LF is not really on their side after all.  I guess we'll have to wait and see how this plays out.  Anyone have any ideas?
3017	Mulled Wino	2013-04-23	Great minds think alike /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> But seriously, I'm worried that they're deliberately making Stannis more unlikable...I know they are, but I'm holding out hope that they make his rescue of the wall thst much more epic and it converts everyone to the fact that Stannis is the only contender that cares about his realm.

3019	Tony Soprano	2013-04-23	The biggest problems are Ros and Shae. Thankfully, the latter was absent this episode. 
I've never liked Ros. I've always thought she takes up unnecessary screentime that could be used to focus on other more important characters. But this episode took my hatred of the character ( or rather, the writing ) to a whole new lever. I don't like what they've done with her at all, especially concerning Littlefinger. I just can't see a man such as him confide his plans to a woman like her. And when she went to snitch to Varys, it frustrated me even more. Her presence is causing more problems than solving them. I don't see the need of replacing Varys' birds, who we never see in the books, with her. It's idiotic. I hope the writers finally let her catch an axe with her forehead this season. 
I also don't like what they're doing to Sansa's relationship with the Tyrells, especially the betrothal. I mean, come on, everyone in the Realm knows Loras and Renly were lovers, and now you want to marry him to Sansa? Unfortunately, it seems the writers have forgotten about Loras' actions in Seasons One and Two, and now they've made him straight. Also, it should have been Willas. Why did they swap him with Loras? It's not like they have to show the character onscreen.
One more thing: I'm skeptical about Dany's story in the future because of the whole Jorah/Selmy situation. I just don't see how they're going to wrap all this up and have the same fallout and ending like in the book.

But it means they have to find another way of Barristan accusing Jorah of spying on Dany for Varys.Suspect they will just have Barristan denounce Jorah at some point but it will be less cool than the uncovering/counter-uncovering that happened in ASoS which causes her to send both on a suicide mission through the Meereen sewers.
3021	Er Rn	2013-04-23	Yeah, all the NW stuff isn't really working for me either. And I agree, the rangers seem more hungry, cold, and grumpy than anything. There is no sense of urgency, no terror than an undead army is out there.
3022	Cas Stark	2013-04-23	The more I think about it, the more perplexed I am about why Varys would even go to Olenna in the first place to tell her about LF wanting to take Sansa with him.

I guess we'll have to wait and see how this plays out.  Anyone have any ideas?If he tells the Lannisters they will still have Sansa, if he tells the QOT, they won't.  So, it fits better w/the original plotline, e.g. Varys is not a Lannister loyalist ultimately.
3023	DragonLady214	2013-04-23	Look, they almost have to. There is no way GRRM will be finished with the book series before the show is off the air, so they have to beat their own path. Sadly, they aren't anywhere near as clever as GRRM.IMHO:  GRRM could have tightened up some of the story lines.  I appreciate how D&D have condensed some of the endless wandering about in the woods (i.e. Arya, Jamie/Brienne, hopefully some of Bran and Dany in Yunkai and Maureen).  Also how they have combined/eliminated certain characters.  There are way too many book characters to make it work on tv.  My Mom loves this show, but she always calls me the next day to clarify since I read the books.  Plus, you have to keep in mind the budget they must work with.  Between the sets, costumes, actors, CGI, etc.  they have to be as economical as possible and still be loyal to the core story.  It will never be as good as the books so you have to judge the series as a stand alone.

3024	Winter's Knight	2013-04-23	I did NOT like Brienne accusing Jaime of being a woman to break his depression- it was wrong for her as she was never a "girls are stupid character" and it was wrong for Jaime because whatever else his faults, misogyny isn't one of them. 
It left a bad taste in my mouth, especially since, In the books it's "craven" that breaks through to him.

I think he has seven chapters over three books.That's the problem with TV. They feel they need to give all characters good amount of screen time. The reason is probably budget, contracts, etc., but it hurts the show. Theon for example has no business being in the show at all, but because it's a show he's there.

I don't like how they changed so many of the characters...from Littlefinger's boldness and carelessness to Stannis' lust and callousness. I don't know why they feel the need to change their attitudes. They're already interesting and well developed characters, why meddle with it? I don't think Loras is part of the Kingsguard in the show. I specifically remember that the boon he asked of Joffrey was an alliance sealed by marriage with Margaery. He was never appointed to Joff's KG.

He's making me start to like him.aww, you must be sad /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' /> your user image.  hey, it's still possible he's not dead quite yet and has some time....maybe?  That really is a missed opportunity though if they don't do it.----I normally wouldn't care about Loras replacing Willas, because the audience is familiar with Loras.  Yes, they don't have to actually introduce Willas, but the writers probably want to keep everyone tightly connected to make the audience feel more invested.  However, my issue with it is how in the books Sansa has this super naive idea that she's going to marry the Knight of Freakin' Flowers (to her - the most beautiful man in the world) and it's totally squashed by the QoT.  I really liked how everything was going in Sansa's arc...the mystery of Ser Dontos, of Willas, of Margaery, her future in general.  Now it's been reduced to her marrying the "most handsome man" in Westeros and LF directly coming to Sansa with his plans.  This show hates mystery, except for the convoluted Theon/Ramsay thing.  Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying it, but it's so annoyingly purposely confusing rather than a mystery.
3038	Masamune	2013-04-23	Yep.  The early reveal of Barristan made sense because viewers would probably realise.  But it means they have to find another way of Barristan accusing Jorah of spying on Dany for Varys.It doesn't matter if people realize. We all knew who Arry was in Harrenhall, didn't we? It made her scenes with Tywin that more compelling (if they ultimately went nowhere). Keeping Barristan's identity a "secret" would've worked fine.

Keeping Barristan's identity a "secret" would've worked fine.Agreed. They shouldn't deviate unless they have to (that ship has sailed) so Daenerys should still believe he's the world's oldest squire.I'm wondering why he hasn't revealed to Daenerys that Jorah is a spy since he's already revealed who he was. Revealing later on would seem kind of sleazy. Is he saving that card for when Jorah annoys him?
3040	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-23	It doesn't matter if people realize. We all knew who Arry was in Harrenhall, didn't we? It made her scenes with Tywin that more compelling (if they ultimately went nowhere). Keeping Barristan's identity a "secret" would've worked fine.Except that it would've made Jorah look like a moron and would have been frustrating to the viewer that he couldn't figure out who he is rather than a somewhat badass "Of course you know me, I'm fucking Barristan Selmy" reveal. Tywin has no idea what Arya looks like.It was also a bit frustrating for me to read that Dany is also so careless about this 60-year old squire coming into her service, just a reminder that she really should've been quite easily killed but is protected for plot reasons.

Keeping Barristan's identity a "secret" would've worked fine.It's different though cos Arya had an obvious reason for keeping her identity hidden.  The audience would realise who Barristan was and spend over a season thinking 'why doesn't he just tell Dany?!' and it would appear not to make sense because we don't find out till after he was worried she was the crazy side of the coin.

We know Dany hates everyone and everything associated with King Bob. Her accepting the Lord Commander of his Kingsguard with really no questions asked was a little strange.The timing of the reveal in the books was also important for ... later events.

3043	aFeastForDragons	2013-04-23	Only thing I didn't like was the the part after the Night's watch guy kills Craster. Their was some really good dialogue but it got buried by rushing the scene. I had to watch it 2-3 times to make out what he said. A minute of extra screen time would have done wonders.
3044	SerMixalot	2013-04-23	I did NOT like Brienne accusing Jaime of being a woman to break his depression- it was wrong for her as she was never a "girls are stupid character" and it was wrong for Jaime because whatever else his faults, misogyny isn't one of them.It left a bad taste in my mouth, especially since, In the books it's "craven" that breaks through to him.people keep saying Jaime wasnt misogynistic.  This is the guy who called Brienne wench for several hundred pages.
3045	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-23	people keep saying Jaime wasnt misogynistic.  This is the guy who called Brienne wench for several hundred pages.Jaime is such a misogynist before he meets Brienne that the only woman he could ever love wanted so desperately to be born a man.
3046	Roose Seal	2013-04-23	^Yeah, Jaime might seem progressive in Westeros terms, but he's still one hell of a chauvinistic pig. You guys might need to re-read his first few chapters with Brienne.
3047	SilentSense	2013-04-23	-so many stories running in parallel now that there is very little progress in each, and what little progress there is feels kinda rushed, and we're almost half way through the season. :Z-tyrell, tyrell. pissed me off more than it should-sorcerer in the box, how unprompted both of varys scenes were, though I did like them a lot-theon and ramsay scene, bran scene.-not showing the hound-beric duel. was getting excited and then they're cutting to dany. which admittedly was quite a nice scene howeverpeople keep saying Jaime wasnt misogynistic.  This is the guy who called Brienne wench for several hundred pages.almost like he wanted to really provoke her or something when in fact they are best mates. weird.

Jaime and Brienne is definitely one of my favorite storylines at this point in the books (and Arya), and their journey is such a slow, brutal haul, emotionally draining haul, and it's quite amazing and definitely humanizes the characters, especially Jaime, who needs it. It has to be rushed in the show, however, and the characters and scenes are becoming more and more one-dimensional as time goes on because not enough screen time can be dedicated to everyone...

3050	Dove	2013-04-23	Somehow I never thought of it that way, ugh. You think it skips around too much now - just wait until we have 5+ prominent new Dornish and Ironborn PoVs doing their own thing, and literally every main character is seperated into their own plot threads besides a few people still remaining together in King's Landing.
It's going to be a huge mess if they try to be too faithful, but if they don't, they'll get reamed by a lot of book people.
3051	The Pain Yak	2013-04-23	1. Show!Littlefinger is several orders of magnitude less devious than his book counterpart. The man simply has had no opportunities past his betrayal of Ned Stark to show off that he's one of the best players of the game around, while getting plenty of new scenes that make him seem downright inept. If Ros had existed in the books, given his treatment of her last season, can anyone possibly imagine Book!Littlefinger possibly being so foolish as to let her see him making his plans with Sansa Stark and trust her (apparently implicitly) to hold her silence? Aren't 'never get your own hands dirty' and 'trust no one' basically two of his rules to live by?
And now he's getting outmaneuvered through mistakes so basic they would have done Ned Stark proud. He looks like an idiot, not a brilliant schemer.
Littlefinger is a character in need of rescuing. And soon, if viewers are to appreciate what a magnificent bastard he's supposed to be.
2. I really wish they would start emphasizing guest right. Said that on WiC.net, and now I say it here. I want them to do it subtly, and I want them to do it in a way that doesn't give away how important it will be for RW, but I want it there so that people understand that what the Freys do isn't just a run-of-the-mill kind of betrayal. Its one of the most horrific crimes imaginable in Westeros, for which they end up loathed even by their new allies. It should be neither neglected nor hammered home so hamfistedly that people can't mistake they're being set up for something; rather, it needs to be subtly slipped in and understood, and the betrayal at Craster's strikes me as a tragic missed opportunity for that.

3052	Tyrion_the_Oneironaut	2013-04-23	Hmm.
-didn't like how Varys caught his sorcerer. I always liked to wonder who it might be(Moqorro)...plus I think seeing the feeble old git begging for help in a crate kind of takes away from the imagery Varys just painted not moments before. The magic was was so creepy it haunts Varys to this day, well big deal because fat lot of good magic did the sorcerer in the end!
-Brienne & Arya's POVs are supposed to give a sense of destruction the war is taking on Westeros. All I'm really sensing are some disenfranchised common folk joining up with the BWB. Even Tyrion has a chapter where he has to deal with the carcases from Blackwater Bay.
-the Astapor slavers came off as cartoonishly stupid. All this time, someone like Ramsay Bolton could have just dropped a chest or two of gold, commanded the Unsullied to attack their former masters & taken their money back & taken over the slave business. Yes I know Astapor has other defenses but they're no match for 8,000 Unsullied.
-the Queen of Thorns hits you over the head with her biting, unsolicited cynicism. I was hoping for more Sophia Patrillo smartassery.
3053	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2013-04-23	On the Brienne and 'Woman' thing.It did cause me to raise my eyebrows on first watch.The second time I thought it might have worked better if there had been more 'Wench' from Jaime...But I have since rewatched E3 to see the Theon/Boy scenes again and came across something. Its from when Brienne and Jaime are talking about the impending rape attemptSo if you were a woman, you'd let them do it? Let them take what ever they want?If I were a woman, I'd make them kill me, but I am not, thank the gods.When you take the two conversations together the later reference to 'woman' makes sense. The writers would have done this deliberately as they would have written all the Jaime+Brienne scenes as a project. Unfortunately the fact we see them a week apart and with so much else going on means the effect they were aiming for misses the mark a bit.

I was hoping for more Sophia Patrillo smartassery.Agreed with your first and fourth points. That Varys scene pissed me off because the convo was way too casual. And while reading the books I always thought there was gonna be something mysterious and amazing regarding Varys and the sorcerer, like something was gonna happen when he finally found him, or maybe he was someone we knew (like you said, moqorro). This just ruins it for me now.Oh how perfect Sophia would have been. God rest her soul! I like Diana Rigg as QoT, but she does tend to ramble. Like the sigils and words speech... that's it, everything she says sounds like a speech! Like she's having a conversation with herself, she never gives anyone else a chance to say anything. I don't think those girls doing the embroidering got a word in!For your third, a lot of people have been saying that. But I think that's the only way for it to work, is if the slavers were stupid. If they were smart the whole thing would have been an epic fail and Dany would also be in an Astapori knot! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
3055	The Pain Yak	2013-04-23	The Astapori slavers falling for such a blindingly obvious ploy was a fault of the books, too. The show creators merely carried it over. Not one of GRRM's stronger plot twists, with a truckload of blatant foreshadowing, but the end result was just so satisfying to read that I didn't really mind.
This is how I personally rationalize it somewhat: Dany got away with it because the Good Masters approached her with a healthy mix of misogyny, contempt and complacency. A Ramsay Snow or some such wouldn't have been able to get away with it because Ramsay is a grown man. Dany, by contrast, is a 15 year old girl. They just didn't take her seriously and saw only a naive little girl to be swindled rather than a potential threat.  
Was it still stupid? Obviously. Yet it was a byproduct of Astapor and its rotting, decadent culture. Safe for so long from danger, they saw only the profit and refused to see the risk.
3056	Adulescentulus Carnifex	2013-04-24	While I agree (in general) that Littlefinger's character has been weakened in the show, keep in mind that unless they make a massive departure from the books, his plan actually comes to fruition.  What better way to demonstrate Varys' point that he's the most dangerous guy around than by magicking Sansa out of King's Landing even while everyone's trying to prevent it, and one-upping that by offing Joffrey in the process.It does make me curious to see how they handle the Tyrell involvement in the Purple Wedding, though. Are they just playing along with Varys, and doing (to book readers) odd things like offering Loras to Sansa because they know it'll never actually happen?  Or will Baelish pull of the whole wedding assassination himself, giving the (little)finger to everyone for thinking they were better than him?  Either way, knowing what we know, we simply can't accept the whole discovery of Littlefinger's plans at face value.

Everyone knowing about Littlefingers plan is a departure from the books, but the involved characters seem to think he's taking her with him to the eyrie when he first leaves, which he doesnt.So hes going to leave for the eyrie, without Sansa. Sansa will be like wtf, Varys will be like wtf, QoT will be like wtf, audience will be like wtf. Then before you know it Sansa is married, then when the PW comes around everyone's forgotten. Then boom, Joff is dead and Littlefinger is back to whisk Sansa away.He still looks like an utter genius after all.

You think it skips around too much now - just wait until we have 5+ prominent new Dornish and Ironborn PoVs doing their own thing, and literally every main character is seperated into their own plot threads besides a few people still remaining together in King's Landing.It's going to be a huge mess if they try to be too faithful, but if they don't, they'll get reamed by a lot of book people.I don't think it will get any worse than this, and I think they're starting to really learn how to give each character arc the screen time they deserve (whether it's the material they deserve is an entirely different matter sadly.). S4 sees a couple of new plots, but also plots merging (Stannis/Sam/Jon, Jaime/KL) and falling away (Cat and Robb). I think it mostly balances out as having the same amount of plots as S3. If the Ironborn and Dorne are introduced in S4, then S5 does not introduce any major character sets (though a few characters like Tyrion are getting their own adventures of course.).
3059	The Roose is Loose	2013-04-24	No disrespect to the nitpickers, but Varys' story of being cut didn't seem out place to me, because, 1. We get the reveal of the sorcerer in the box, and thus the culmination of his "lesson" to Tyrion that he can get the revenge he wants on Tywin and Cersei if he plays the long game, and 2. Varys' story parallels Jamie's current story (an important part is cut off, and each character resolves to endure the hardship and remake himself).
My nitpick is the tywin's kingdom count (3 in open rebellion).  It's thoroughly discussed by others, but the proper count is 2 (the North & Iron islands), since riverlands and Dragonstone aren't/weren't kingdoms when aegon landed and the storm lords bent the knee after tbotbw.  In the show I think they simplified to 3 kingdoms, because there are still 3 other kings alive (Robb, balon, Stannis).

What was King Harren the king of then?I'd argue that Aegon did subdue 7 kingdoms, and Trident/Riverlands was one of those. The others being the North, Iron Isles, the Vale, the Stormlands, the Reach and what ever the Lannisters called their lands in the West at the time. Dorne was added generations later through marriage rather than subjugation.

3063	aFeastForDragons	2013-04-24	This is why part of me is dreading everything past season 4.The show is going to really drag then. 10 episodes of:Jon and Stannis wandering around Castle Black documenting wildling refugees, castle repairs and food supplies. Brienne going up and down the Riverlands.Dany sitting in Mereen with a host of new unpronounceable cast members trying to marry her while the dragons and her Unsullied do nothing.Littlefinger biding his time in the Eyrie while Varys has disappeared. The Tyrion, Ironborn, Arya, Samwell, Davos, Reek plots will be really good though.

"We never sell more than 1/3 of them to any one person...but this bitch doesn't have the money any how. Wait, did you say dragons?! Sold! Good thing too, because we haven't had a sale in a long time, and these guys are expensive to feed.."As for the Varys scene, I can live with it. I just thought in the books it was a nice creepy window into the wonderful world of Rhollor, about which we find out more the very next episode. Someone as disturbing as Varys showing fear of fire magic would have been a nice note to end the scene on.
3066	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2013-04-24	Ok maybe i'm slow..but where exactly is Theon being kept prisoner? the Dreadfort or Moat Cailin? and if that really is The dreadfort and not Moat Cailin wouldn't he(Theon) be able to tell the difference?
And we still haven't had a single hint of Jon's warging abilities. I was expecting Orell to point it out(Its said in Varamyr's prologue that skinchangers can recognise one another).

I think the Crownlands belonged to one of the other kingdoms before Aegon the Conqueror came along, Dragonstone never had a king and was just an outpost for the Valyrians (not sure why they set up shop there, but that was Aegon's jumping off point), and the Riverlands were occupied territory under the rule of the Iron Islanders. That leaves the Iron Islands as the seventh of the seven kingdoms since they had a king. I could be wrong about that, but that's my understanding.And yeah, 'making the eighth' was a TV show invention, I'm certain of it. No POV characters around Bob Baratheon to see what went on during his hunting trip, which is the scene where the dialogue comes up.

Yes I know Astapor has other defenses but they're no match for 8,000 Unsullied.Drogon is worth a hell of a lot more than a couple of chests of gold. He's one of only 3 dragons in the entire world. If someone had tried to buy a large amount of unsullied with gold I'm sure they would have been suspicious, but the thought of owning something so rare and priceless as a dragon blinded them from the obvious dangers.
3069	ladyinblack	2013-04-24	Agree with most of the nitpicking here....why do D&D think the only way to keep viewers is dumbing down a good storyline? Understand that they had to reduce the huge list of characters but shouldn't they have a few more people around in the courtyards etc?
Hate Ros, Shae  and the Podrick scenes. It takes away valuable time from story development of important characters & plots. If they had time to concoct this garbage, they had time to use for plot development
Sorcerer in a box????why?just stupid
LF is nothing like in the books + in the books he didn't spend his page time in brothels.
Another thing--costumes...Margery, Ros and Shae look like they got into the wardrobe of Aladdin or Spartacus. It is autumn in KL!
No excuse in  leaving out Mormonts last words & The Slayer bit
3070	Sword of the Morning Wood	2013-04-24	No excuse in  leaving out Mormonts last words & The Slayer bitIf you watch the season 3 trailer, there's clearly an Other walking menacingly towards something in the woods. I'm sure Sam will kill a white walker but they've just moved it to after Craster's Keep. Otherwise what would be the point in introducing the dragonglass at the end of season 2? I'll be dissapointed if nobody but Gilly sees him slay the Other as a great part of 'the slayer' story was that all the men of the Night's Watch saw/knew it was the big fat coward Sam that killed the Other. Although he does get teased afterwards, I always felt they had a new, if begrudging, respect for him after that. If nobody sees him do it, I doubt many people will believe him when he gets back to Castle Black.
3071	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-24	I actually liked Brienne's line, why are so many people complaining? 
She has trouble with her identity in the novels aswell, for example when she accidentally says she's her Father's only son. Then realises what she said. 
She wasn't insulting women because she doesn't respect women but because in her mind this is something that would trigger a reaction from a man like Jaime.

She is a character who compares dying in childbirth to dying in battle. She tells Catelyn that she has a Â<U+0093>womanÂ<U+0092>s kind of courage,Â<U+0094> and she greatly admires that. At this point in the story, the person that she respects the most Â<U+0097> the person she pledged loyalty to, and is willing to risk everything for Â<U+0097> is a woman. She does not pledge for Robb, King in the North. She pledges for his mother, because Catelyn is the one who helped her, and Catelyn is strong one who deserves her fealty.

3074	Ran	2013-04-24	This doesn't change the fact that Brienne has spent all her life in a culture that subordinates women and in which she has, by her very nature and her desires, struggled to separate herself from that subordinating culture by taking on aspects of male roles and life. There'd be something rather wrong, in fact, if she was all about female empowerment and how strong and fierce women are all the time; it'd ring false.Brienne has an ambiguous relationship with the idea of femininity. She honors and respects it on the one hand, but deep down it's a hindrance to her, a thing she can't really partake in the prescribed ways.In that article, note the qualification of what Brienne says: "a woman's kind of courage". Not courage, general. She has the Westerosi gendered world-view, just as most characters do.On top of that, let me add that she does not need to deeply believe women cry and weep at the merest problem to use this against Jaime. She just has to know (as she does) that this is the stereotype, however unjust, and she has to know (as she does, as she saw last episode from the Kingslayer himself) that Jaime would be spurred to anger and resistance if she applied that stereotype to him.It's the exact same thing as people going overboard on Yara Asha calling Theon a cunt, all because of her observation in ADwD that she thinks men are quite ridiculous about considering that such an insult. That doesn't mean she wouldn't use it -- it's just proof of men's stupidity that they're bothered by it but, hey, if they're bothered by it, by all means, she'd use it.

3075	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-24	But Brienne doesn't look at women as less brave, she recognizes Cat's woman's courage for instance.Etahttp://feministficti...watch-is-ended/Oh, but I said that Brienne doesn't hate women. Brienne shows no signs of being a misogynist  but she does understand that this is a ''man's world'' so to speak, and she also understands that because of this, to call a swordsman as weak a ''woman'' is very much going to be an insult to him.Why should Brienne be all for female empowerment? She is an outsider looking in. She was born a woman but can not partake in many of the actions of other noble women. She's not pretty, she's not elegant or delicate. She definitely appreciates women though, and understands courage when she sees it, whomever displays it, man or woman. But it would be foolish to disagree that in this world, a character like Jaime Lannister would definitely be insulted by this. It's not that she doesn't like women, but that she understands this will be a motivator for Jaime.

Maybe it's used differently in the US, but in the UK, you can call someone a "dick" a "prick" or an "arsehole" and it means pretty much the same thing.
3077	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-24	Yeah, exactly ''cunt'' is really not gender specific WHEN USED AS AN INSULT in the UK.
3078	Lady Arwen	2013-04-25	Tiny nitpick:In the same scene you have Tywin pronouncing Tyrell as "tyrr-ELL" and Cersei pronouncing it "TY-rell". Which is it!YES. This irked me. Couldn't have just done one more take where they both said it the same way, eh?

But I think there's a bit to say about her facial expression and the sort of disgust and disdain she expresses when saying it. i think that speaks to her inner conflict regarding the  double standard not only manifested by men of Westerosi society, but also the common woman's/lady's acceptance and adherence to their typical societal roles. I thought it was quite a deep and provoking line, actually.
3080	The Pain Yak	2013-04-25	In contrast to people complaining about Brienne the self-hating woman, I thought changing Dany's response to Valar Morghulis to 'Yes, all men must die, but we are not men' was a little too overtly girl powerish. Made me cringe a bit.

I was just about to tell you about when I was cut!"It wasn't the story in and of itself that felt forced but I felt like it didn't come up organically.I thought the fact that they threw in the sorcerer-filled crate made the urgency of his story fit perfectly.

I remember watching the Wire when McNulty calls his ex-wife a cunt and thinking 'shit that was harsh, can they do that in America?'Of all those words 'bitch' is the only one you can call a girl.  Stuff like prick, twat, bastard, wanker etc. just sounds strange when talking about a girl, same with 'cunt'.

3088	Tyrion_the_Oneironaut	2013-04-26	Yeah, what does that even mean?Just a play on words. She's not gonna die.
3089	FattyPeon	2013-04-26	Just a play on words. She's not gonna die.Yeah but, she's not gonna die ever? It doesn't work, that was my point. Why did they write that?
3090	Tyrion_the_Oneironaut	2013-04-26	Yeah but, she's not gonna die ever? It doesn't work, that was my point. Why did they write that?I'm pretty sure that was in the book. And it's to show her confidence.'We're gonna live forever', and all that. Just a figure of speech.
3091	FattyPeon	2013-04-26	In the book it goes something like:
Dany: you might die etc
Missandei: Valar Morghulis
Dany: Yes, but not for a long while, we can hope.
Something like that, something not at all ridiculous.
3092	The Pain Yak	2013-04-26	In the book it goes something like:Dany: you might die etcMissandei: Valar MorghulisDany: Yes, but not for a long while, we can hope.Something like that, something not at all ridiculous.Right. The exchange about how Missandei faced death and disease and starvation if she followed Dany is there, Missandei's response is there...but the follow-up is changed from 'yeah, we'll die, but hopefully not for a long time' to 'we are not men.'I know it was supposed to express confidence. Instead, to me, it just seemed nonsensical and absurd. No, Dany, I'm pretty sure eventually dying applies to you and your new handmaiden, too.This is one thing I hope they start veering away from. Dany saying stuff like that...and half her second season dialogue seemed to consist of dialogue like that, boasting and threatening and telling everyone around her how special and powerful she is...doesn't make her seem confident or cool to me so much as naive and short-sighted.Then again, given where her storyline goes from here, perhaps that's intentional...
3093	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-26	Yeah but, she's not gonna die ever? It doesn't work, that was my point. Why did they write that?In context, she asks Missandei if she's worried that in her service she may even die. Missandei says all men must die. Dany says yes, but we're not men. So of course Dany isn't asserting that they will be immortal, but rather Missandei need not worry because the two of them will go a long way. No easy deaths kind of thing. I don't know, it's sort of half silly but it was still kind of badass.
3094	teemo	2013-04-26	Yeah, it's kind of a stupid line.  I also notice how in the show Dany randomly switches from playing the badass to innocent girl card back and forth...like one second she's trying to give water to some dying slave, next minute she's telling Missandei, "you're mine now and you're prolly gonna die." (she was so much nicer to her in the books) They're trying too hard to make her a badass with a heart of gold.

3097	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-26	Nah, she's definitely a better person in the books.Dany quite obviously teeters between huge badass conqueror and conflicted young woman in the novels. She says as much with her own words.
3098	teemo	2013-04-26	I understand she can be a mixed bag in the books, but it's even more pronounced in the show.  When they cut out the season 2 of Doreah strangling Irri it seemed overly harsh to lock up Doreah alive like that.

Doreah in the books does nothing of the sort.
3100	teemo	2013-04-26	I know that (obviously, her dragons weren't even stolen in the books), but it didn't really make that clear in the show unless you saw the deleted footage.  It didn't to me anyway.

Dany sees members of her Khalasar slain and her dragons stolen by orders of a man with whom her hand maiden is now fucking. She sees it as terrible betrayal (Which it actually is) and condemns her to death. The reason the stangling scene is cut is because it was awful and because they knew people would figure out that Doreah betrayed her.

I think they should just have GRRM read some chapters live on TV every week because they can't do it justice, they have proved that since episode one of season two. Also, fans who have already read the books are not allowed to be confused by minor changes in the series. FURTHERMORE, the collective body of readers must be contacted before any changes are made to approve of them...like, we were here first, everyone else can fuck right off.
Season one was good, not great, they should have ended it there.

It's just a small thing and I understood it once I saw the cut footage, but at the time it was just weird to me.A character's motivation to any event is not whatsoever influenced by what you think. The Freys weakened their position greatly with the RW. Balon Greyjoy was a total moron to attack the North instead of Lannisport. Ramsey should not have gone to the extents that he did to torture Theon. Our opinion doesn't matter to the characters.Doreah is a whore, but she was bought by Viserys to please him and sort of act as Dany's handmaiden when he wasn't calling on her. After Viserys dies, what is Doreah's role besides to be Dany's handmaiden? She follows her through the Red Waste to get to Qarth, a choice she didn't need to make since Dany offered everybody freedom to leave. She follows Dany and befriends her. She is in her service. And because she's a whore she should not only forego her service but consort with men who betrayed her? Again, look at it from Dany's point of view, not your own. You are not the character.
3107	teemo	2013-04-26	I know, but I'm saying that I didn't even understand that Doreah betrayed Dany.  Maybe that makes me an idiot, but I can't understand a character's motivation for something that I'm not even getting.
3108	teemo	2013-04-26	lol, I'm rewatching this with a friend right now (she is still screaming about Jaime's hand), and I didn't even notice the Ty-RELL vs. TY-rell thing between Cersei and Tywin until reading this thread....not only is it inconsistent, but it's literally in back to back sentences!  Kind of strange that no one caught that.
3109	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-26	I understand your point, but I think if you look at Dany's reaction and her actions, its safe to say she truly believed Doreah had betrayed her for her own benefit (Promise of riches, power, whatever). I hope I don't sound condescending or anything through this conversation, I just think that if you put yourself in the character's position it would seem actually quite reasonable. I feel like sometimes in response to people's posts I come off as brash but when I watched the scene I had a totally understanding reaction to Doreah being condemned to the cell.

3117	Sansa in the North	2013-04-27	people keep saying Jaime wasnt misogynistic.  This is the guy who called Brienne wench for several hundred pages.^Yeah, Jaime might seem progressive in Westeros terms, but he's still one hell of a chauvinistic pig. You guys might need to re-read his first few chapters with Brienne.He was trying to provoke her. I think it went something like this:Brienne: Don't call me wench, Kingslayer.Jaime: My name is Jaime, not Kingslayer.Brienne: Do you deny that you slew a king?Jaime: No, do you deny your sex?He never says that being a wench is a bad thing. He's like, yeah you're a woman, why do you deny it? He is, in fact, giving her a clear message that there's nothing wrong with being a woman.I still maintain that Jaime is one of the least sexist characters in the series. He treats women exactly the same way he treats men. He executes rapists (see Pia) and when his squire is attracted to Pia, he advises her to be gentle and considerate to her, for her sake. He has always been faithful to Cersei. And I don't remember reading a single sexist thing in a Jaime POV chapter.Cersei laments in one of her chapters that she and Jaime used to dress up in each others clothes and she couldn't understand why they were treated so differently. I think Jaime also noticed that and growing up with Cersei is what has made him respect women. Now, Cersei is a "other girls are stupid, but I'm a honorary man" kind of character, but that's another issue...sorry, I'm not even sure if this belongs in this thread, but Jaime is my favourite character and you know how it is with defending your favourites /blush.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':blush:' />

While I perhaps could make myself believe Jaime would react in that way after being insulted as "womanish", because he would recognize it as a (Westerosian) contemptuous insult. But the problem is that it's Brienne who's speaking. I know D&D have altered Brienne's character into a more grim direction (and so far it hasn't been a good chance, IMO), but this just doesn't work even there. I don't think Brienne would make herself use such a misogynistic insult especially as 'coward' or 'craven' would have driven the point home as successfully.  So, in order to make that scene work for me, I should believe Brienne uses an "insult" she doesn't believe in and would be reluctant to use in the first place, and a very sick Jaime feels he should react in a proper macho way and ends up doing just that even though he doesn't really feel insulted. Well, sorry, too complicated and ridiculous. The exchange might be seen as a black comedy, but somehow I feel D&D aren't going to expand it to make it work.I also thought that in the books J&B's wench/Kingslayer namecalling became gradually somewhat playful - I don't see that kind of progress happening here.

3123	Pearlthegirl	2013-04-29	Jaime is such a misogynist before he meets Brienne that the only woman he could ever love wanted so desperately to be born a man.Bwahhahahahaha!
3124	Broken Fox	2013-04-21	Aside from the awesome ending these scenes were my favorite from the episode. They were brutal. Jaime is a broken man and NCW is playing it perfectly.
3125	Katydid	2013-04-21	I can't imagine how many times NCW had to shower after every one of his scenes.  He's always covered in mud!
3126	Kasrith	2013-04-21	Even that opening scene with his blank face was gold
3127	The Flaying Man	2013-04-21	I can't speak enough praise for NCW, he embodies Jaime. And as an added bonus, we get his deliverance to the Leech Lord next week!
3128	iheartseverus	2013-04-21	Seeing Jaime Lannister utterly helpless, getting kicked and repeatedly slammed face down in the mud and horseshit was..  shocking, as it was meant to be.  It sort of mirrors what Theon is facing--the brutal stripping away of everything that made him who he is.  Who and what comes out the other side of that furnace--that's the question.
3129	scurvy	2013-04-21	He seemed pretty good with the sword in his left.  At least passable for a weakened man with blood loss, and little food or exercise for a year.
3130	TheMountianNick	2013-04-21	Feel incredibly bad for him.  It took being held captive, for his sister's influence to leave him.  He does the right thing in saving Brienne, and what does it get him?  The look on NCW;s face this episode is heart breaking.  You can tell he is broken.  I think he is realizing that he was nothing but a tool for everyone around him for so long, and now he is a broken tool.  What does he have left?
3131	tito5601	2013-04-21	making him drink horsepiss was cruel, locke is evil but i cant help but love noah taylor in watever movie he is

I think he is realizing that he was nothing but a tool for everyone around him for so long, and now he is a broken tool.  What does he have left?That's the perfect summary for Jaime.  And once a tool has broken, who needs it around anymore?  Ugh, Jaime... <3
3133	go joff go	2013-04-21	He sad puppy face were pretty hard not to feel sorry for.
3134	Ser Greguh	2013-04-21	NCW earned his paycheck this episode, that much is for sure.  I wonder how many takes he had to do of having his face buried in horseshit.  "Sorry Nikolaj, the light wasn't quite right in that one.  Okay Nikolaj, we need a wide shot of that for the editor.  Okay Nikolaj, come on, man, that take wasn't quite convincing.  Really bury your face in that shit."
3135	Broken Fox	2013-04-21	It was mud not horseshit. He actually talked about filming those scenes on Conan the other day.
3136	LordStoneheart	2013-04-22	My brother and dad were laughing at first. I love that non-reader fans hate Jaime since the book fans are all over his nuts for some reason.
But after a few minutes into the scene they seemed a bit more sympathetic, so I think showJaime will eventually get to his current fangirl status.
3137	Dagon Greyjoy	2013-04-22	I love that non-reader fans hate Jaime since the book fans are all over his nuts for some reason.In the books, Jaime is funny and Bran is immensely boring. He was so boring at some point I started thinking: Had Jaime killed Bran we wouldn't have to endure Bran POVs, and in the end actually stopped feeling bad about Bran and started resenting Jaime for botching the murder. Show viewers are never confronted with the sheer drudgery of reading thru a Bran POV, so they don't forgive Jaime that easily. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
3138	Eric Xayavong	2013-04-22	Yes, yes. Let the sympathizing begin!

3140	Isrararrafi	2013-04-22	My brother's reaction at the beginning of the jamie sequence "hahahaha" 
He kept laughing right until jamie threw up and took the sword....
Then silence throughout...
At the end....damn i am actually feeling sorry for him now...
By the way he is a non book reader /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> the makers/directors/actor got the job done perfectly
3141	Dove	2013-04-22	That scene of him vomiting and wallowing in the mud, ugh. Really brutal. Even if the name is changed, Locke's pretty obviously got Hoat's personality/sick sense of humor.
Did kind of laugh out loud when one of my friends asked, "Uh, why does that guy carry around a flask of horse piss?"
3142	Toshio.Keepiru	2013-04-22	I welcome it.  Hopefully the threat on his other hand is just a hint of what the future holds for him.
3143	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-22	Yeah, his scenes were brutal. I liked Brienne calling out that he was about to fall, even when he was just starting to list a bit.
3144	Oakenfist	2013-04-22	That scene of him vomiting and wallowing in the mud, ugh. Really brutal. Even if the name is changed, Locke's pretty obviously got Hoat's personality/sick sense of humor.Did kind of laugh out loud when one of my friends asked, "Uh, why does that guy carry around a flask of horse piss?"Horse piss would be used to put out the camp fires.I actually have no idea but that's the only logical reason I came up with.

If those aren't true then he really did just carry the jug around thinking hey why not make the Kingslayer drink some horse piss now.

3148	The Mondrian Oak	2013-04-22	I think the whole thing is as simple as it looks: "let's fill a jug with horse piss, so that we give it to the Kingslayer instead of water". A sadistic prank.

3156	DogLover	2013-04-22	I think Jaime's character is one of the best and most accurate portrayals in the tv series. His and Brienne's scenes have been amazing, especially in this episode. I've been watching the tv series with my husband (hasn't read any of the books) who was initially appalled that Jaime is one of my favorite characters, but after losing his hand and getting the shit kicked out of him, my husband agreed that Jaime is now a very sympathetic character and he's very reluctantly starting to actually root for him.

3164	Drogo_1	2013-04-22	My biggest problem with this episode is the beginning of Jamie's scene. I Hated that they had his severed hand around Jamie's neck. They should've followed GRRM's brilliance and hung his hand around Brienne so it was slapping her tits. it's the little things that matter and that would've been better. All and all Jamie looked like a broken bitch.
3165	King of the North(west)	2013-04-22	Jaime does actually drink the horsepiss in the book too
Once they handed him a cup and he quaffed it straight away, trembling, and the Brave Companions burst into laughter so loud and harsh it hurt his ears. â<U+0080><U+009C>Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s horse piss youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re drinking, Kingslayer,â<U+0080><U+009D> Rorge told him.

But there was also a part where they put them both in the same saddle, facing eachother, so the hand did bounce off her tits in that moment

All and all Jamie looked like a broken bitch.Why would Vargo Hoat tie Jaime's hand around Brienne's neck? If this happened as you say in the book (which it doesn't) why would it be even better than having it tied around Jaime's own neck?Nicolaj is doing an amazing job. Unbelievable actually.
3169	MsLibby	2013-04-22	I loved that he looked dead in his eyes  as he was riding the horse, in both scenes.There was no life in them and that is not an easy thing to do for an actor or anyone. There is usually a spark of some kind. But not last night! Jaime's eyes were dead

That is book purism at its finest!

3171	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-04-22	This scene was amazing - it captivated me, especially since I knew "Dracarys!" was coming - in that moment I did not care and was content to just watch it.  I think NCW and G. Christie are both doing such an excellent job. I do feel sorry for Jaime. Really, all of the actors are really stepping up this season. It's very exciting.

3174	cybobbie	2013-04-22	NCW is simply awesome as Jaime, since when Jaime was at his best and now that he is in the bottom his acting is brilliant. Last episode's scenes made me upset from start, I mean only to see the hand on his neck was shocking. It was cruel while reading the book, but to actually watch it was really painful, specially because NCW does it so well, the look on his face was a heart breaker. I love all his scenes with Brienne, always very exciting to watch.

3180	Damar	2013-04-22	I actually kinda liked that Jaime has some skill with his non-fighting hand, or the wirters at least keeping open the possiblity that Jaime might be as good with that other hand after he gets a chance to recover and train, instead of almost completly useless as he became in the books.
3181	Peptalk	2013-04-22	My mother is reluctantly starting to sympathize with him now, and my friends. FINALLY!
The opening scene was very moving and incredibly well done. It starts with your "just" pitying his situation and ends with you mortified with how helpless he actually is, and how cruelly treated. I also loved their second scene, when she encourages him to eat and live, especially since they through Brienne explained why his selling Vargo (oh, I know he's called Locke on the show but I can't bring myself to stop calling him Vargo) on sapphires last week was so incredible. The fact that there are no sapphires on Tarth and that he knows it enhances that it is an act of genuine kindness and compassion, since it is evident that it is a lie he came up with just to save her from rape.
Jaime <3
This is his season and I hope Coster-Waldau will be rewarded for his portrayal of Jaime when award season is coming up. Both he and Christie excel in their roles and Jaime's and Brienne's storyline is definitely my favourite. I'm happy they are staying so true to it.

3183	Peptalk	2013-04-22	Oh and I liked that he was quite apt with his left hand as well. It does emphasize that he is/was a great swordsman that he isn't utterly helpless with a sword even if it's the wrong hand. I also loved how he reached for the sword with his stump when he dropped it, before he realized he had to use his left hand. Reflexes are reflexes and it's realistic that he does.

3187	jarl the climber	2013-04-22	Horse piss would be used to put out the camp fires.I actually have no idea but that's the only logical reason I came up with. Lol.There is some evidence that urine was used to clean out wounds, so maybe it had some medicinal purpose.
3188	MsLibby	2013-04-22	Urine, mostly human but I'm sure other animals would do, was often used during the medieval times for cleaning stuff, particularly armour and linen.
3189	aFeastForDragons	2013-04-22	It was also used for dying hair but that was more a tribal thing.
3190	lostinwesteros	2013-04-22	What's happening to Jaime is just unspeakable.  Having his hand dangling over his shoulder, the horse piss, facing down in the mud, the threat of having his other hand cut off.  And how about the pain from having one hand amputated with a dirty knife and no bandage that I could see.  But so glad Brienne knew just what to do to make him at least eat.  It's like Catelyn told her at Renly's death, that she had to live (and flee) in order to get revenge (and Littlefinger - or was it someone else? - telling Loras the same thing - to flee Stannis' army so that he could seek revenge later.
3191	jons nissa	2013-04-22	as everyone has already said, the scene was brilliant and if i weren't already sympathetic to the kingslayer, i would be now. i especially loved that he tried to fight with his left hand and then brienne joined in to defend her, eh, friend. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />  i think coster-waldau is doing a bang up job with this and i look forward to more of him and brienne.

3194	Katydid	2013-04-22	Honestly I really enjoy watching Jaime the child killing monster suffer.Has Jaime killed a child?  I must've missed that scene. I did read the scene where he intended for Bran to die, in order to protect his own children.  Does that excuse his actions?  No, but it perhaps explains them.  Was it twisted and wrong?  Yes.  Was it a man/father/lover choosing the lesser of two evils?  Yes.  In Jaime's mind, Bran's death would save his own children and sister from death.  Not a nice choice to have to make, but he made it nonetheless.  /leaving.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':leaving:' />

(even if she hates him).  She could understand why Jaime would attempt to kill a child he does not know to save his own.
3196	David Selig	2013-04-22	Yeah, but Jaime only needed to kill Bran because he was committing high treason in just about the dumbest way possible. So no sympathy from me, he put himself in this position though recklessness and extreme selfishness.
 Then there's the murder of Jory and the other two Stark men, which is even worse and completely unjustifiable in my book.

Other answered on the merit of the thing in this thread, so Ill not repeat out Jaime's fanboys mantra, as I do too often.
3199	Chickren	2013-04-27	I saw this too. In the books Jaime FEELS incapable of doing the same deeds as with the right hand, but keeps practicing with Illyn PAyne for quite a number of pages. In the show, he already killed the poor Ned's guard with a left handed knife in the eye.Yes, the show may be offering us a more objective view of his capabilities with his left hand. We only know how he's doing from his pov and compared to his right, he thinks he's awful.It would be interesting if he were actually average or something.
3200	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-27	Yeah, but Jaime only needed to kill Bran because he was committing high treason in just about the dumbest way possible. So no sympathy from me, he put himself in this position though recklessness and extreme selfishness.Then there's the murder of Jory and the other two Stark men, which is even worse and completely unjustifiable in my book.Regarding the Jory/Stark thing, they were at war, which started when Cat captured Tyrion. Killing soldiers in a war isn't really murder, and I think it was pretty despicable. But that's the point. Jaime did despicable things and then later does honorable things when he realizes what sort of man he's become. The fact that some people sympathize with him and some people still despise him means he's wonderfully written and portrayed.
3201	Lady Lu	2013-04-27	I thought that as well! He looked a lot better than I was expecting. Credit to NCW for pulling that off as he said his left hand is basicaly useless himself.Is NCW right-handed? Gods I hope he gets a pay raise for spending the next several years doing everything with his off hand. Adding my voice to the chorus of he is the perfect Jamie.

Adding my voice to the chorus of he is the perfect Jamie.If you watch this, although he's fighting mainly two handed, all the other hand-dominant things he does is right-handed, and he does hold the sword in his right. So I believe he is a righty. http://www.youtube.c...h?v=7L8ByreRfUo

Also very nice to see Jaime in fighting form again (well, obvious repercussions for the good folks of Winterfell aside).

3205	Lady Arwen	2013-04-27	Nikolaj is a perfect Jaime, it's like he just walked out of the books.Yes, this! For awhile I thought NCW had too much rugged masculinity to portray the Jaime of my imagination (I pictured more...delicate...facial features), but all those reservations have long since gone out the window. He's perfection: both physically and in terms of his portrayal of the character.
3206	nara	2013-04-28	Did kind of laugh out loud when one of my friends asked, "Uh, why does that guy carry around a flask of horse piss?"Laughed out loud reading your post, because I had the same reaction, even though I read the books
3207	SerMudz	2013-04-28	Yes, this! For awhile I thought NCW had too much rugged masculinity to portray the Jaime of my imagination (I pictured more...delicate...facial features), but all those reservations have long since gone out the window. He's perfection: both physically and in terms of his portrayal of the character.NCW embodies Jaime, from day one he's been one of the best portrayals on the show and the material hes getting this season is finally giving the chance to show what a fantastic actor he is.I'll admit back when S1 first aired he didnt look how I magined him (even now when i read the books i imagine him exactly like this http://en.amokanet.r...d8a96329f1b1591)But now I think hes perfect, the mannerisms, the wit, his speech, everything.
3208	SilentSense	2013-04-28	Has Jaime killed a child?  I must've missed that scene.I did read the scene where he intended for Bran to die, in order to protect his own children.  Does that excuse his actions?  No, but it perhaps explains them.  Was it twisted and wrong?  Yes.  Was it a man/father/lover choosing the lesser of two evils?  Yes.  In Jaime's mind, Bran's death would save his own children and sister from death.  Not a nice choice to have to make, but he made it nonetheless. /leaving.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':leaving:' />Indeed, just like Cersei. Everything she does, she does for Tommen, a mother choosing the lesser evils. /leaving.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':leaving:' />

His whole life has involved dancing on a string to Cersei/s whims, and she doesn't even love him. I hope the show is able to drive this point home.
3210	King Kev.	2013-04-28	The show is doing an excellent job in conveying his brokenness. Without his hand, he feels as if he's nothing. And the way Locke and co. are treating him isn't helping. The horse piss was just fucking brutal. You really do feel sorry for the bastard who pushed Bran out the window. And thus begins character redemption arc.
3211	boojam	2013-04-23	Its been mentioned but I just wanted to note a topic.
He has been good all along , the intro theme being famous now.
Now Episode 4's ending and behind the credits was hit out of the park.
I know it's sort of a rework of E10 Season 1 ending...
but this was zinger!
To me I noticed a touch of Ennio Morricone.
That was great Ramin!
I do not know why you have not won an Emmy (or been nominated) for this show.

3212	Loras	2013-04-28	I think that the best piece of music from this episode is the score to Theon speaking about Ned being his true father.
Merging the Greyjoy theme and the Stark theme so majestically - it really helped the scene pull at the heart strings.
That being said the ending score was very powerful too.
3213	Bayard	2013-04-28	The soundtrack for season 1 was outstanding. S2 was nice, but not more... I'll have to hear the entire soundtrack for season 3 to have an opinion about it.... hearing it during the episodes can be deceiving. I was not that impressed with the Dracarys song.

I'll have to hear the entire soundtrack for season 3 to have an opinion about it.... hearing it during the episodes can be deceiving. I was not that impressed with the Dracarys song.I felt that Season 1 was a lot more repetetive, less bold. Compare "What is Dead may Never Die" to almost any track on the Season 1 soundtrack. Or Valar Morghulis.
3215	tito5601	2013-04-28	i really liked the soundtrack that came up last season in almost every stannis scene for it was perfect  http://www.youtube.c...h?v=04yq13nNaXwalso this one i think is pretty good  http://www.youtube.c...h?v=AkQXZSQqFag
3216	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	Loved it.  
"I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are"
And loved the last line when Cersei says "perhaps you should try to stop him from doing what he likes". 
"I will".
Sounds like there definitely might be some adjustments to the book story after the PW
3217	Dragonstoned	2013-04-22	Funny how she said Tye-rells and he said Tyh-rells.  And her saying CONtribute and him saying conTRIBute.  Almost as if he was correcting her.
Loved him turning the 'not as smart as you think you are' back on her too.
3218	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-22	I loved this too because Dan in one interview clearly thought Cersei was much smarter than she was, it was high time for Tywin to put her back in her place. And no this is not misogynistic, Cersei is not a good average for all women, and I do love seeing smart female characters like Daenerys and Margaery make the most of their wits on the show, too.

3219	Tourniquet	2013-04-22	Tywin is one of the best casted characters on the show. I love his portrayal.
3220	Gannicus	2013-04-22	Tywin dresses down everyone doesn't he? But no doubt it was a great scene. Has there been a scene with Tywin that hasn't rocked?
3221	Roose Seal	2013-04-22	Should the "I will" be taken as a hint that Tywin might have been in on his grandson's poisoning?
3222	Gannicus	2013-04-22	Should the "I will" be taken as a hint that Tywin might have been in on his grandson's poisoning?I doubt it, but I hope that means we'll get the scene where  he ushers him off to bed and the line "And any man who must say 'I am the king' is no true king at all."
3223	cuendillar	2013-04-22	Should the "I will" be taken as a hint that Tywin might have been in on his grandson's poisoning?No more than his book line of teaching Joffrey "a sharp lesson", as he once did to Tyrion when he had the audacity to marry a commoner. Whatever Tywin's up to, King Festering Boil is not going to like it.
3224	Greywolf2375	2013-04-22	Should the "I will" be taken as a hint that Tywin might have been in on his grandson's poisoning?Not in my opinion.I take it more in the place of - whether they include it in the show or not - his dismissing the king from the council chambers and having the KG escort him out. Joffrey may be the King, but Tywin is in charge.
3225	Our Blades Are Sharp	2013-04-22	The sharp lesson will coincide with the line we've being hearing joff say in the promos methinks.
"..they are mine to torment." oh, joff /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />
3226	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-22	I've read there are going to be some QoT/Tywin scenes added that weren't in the book.  Should be fantastic.
3227	cybobbie	2013-04-22	I loved the scene. Charles Dance portrays a perfect Tywin IMO, making easy for the character to dress down everyone. I really can't wait to see a scene with him and Joffrey.
3228	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	I think its bigger than having the KG escort him out.  Tyrion already slapped him.  
Im thinking one of three things
1) as mentioned possibly tywin is indicated to have a part in the pw.
2) joff's vrossbow comes back to bite tywin in te bowels for embarrassing joff.  (Fired by tyrion though)
3) tywin teaches him a new sharp lesson, not in the books.
3229	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	I loved the scene. Charles Dance portrays a perfect Tywin IMO, making easy for the character to dress down everyone. I really can't wait to see a scene with him and Joffrey.The Lannisters as a family are the best cast.
3230	Hotpie4theironthrone	2013-04-22	Absolutely loved this scene.
I hope they take it one further in the next episode with him planning to marry her off, as i think that is a very important in the book for Tywin's character, showing he doesn't give a fuck about Cersei and putting her in her place etc
3231	Roose Seal	2013-04-22	The Lannisters as a family are the best cast.I just want Charles Dance to record all the audiobooks. I could listen to that sharp deep voice of his all day long.
3232	Dragonstoned	2013-04-22	So far we've had a scene with Tywin and each of his children (Jaime s1, Tyrion and now Cersei s3) and he has owned them every time.  He rinsed his family in the camp in s1 and sent Reginald Lannister away from Harrenhal in s2.
Need more scenes with Tywin dressing down other Lannisters!
3233	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-22	The Lannisters as a family are the best cast.Agreed.  The Cersei/Tywin relationship is just great.  Cersei makes a great case for herself as being marginalized juss because she is a woman, and that otherwise, she's better qualified than any of them.  And Lena Headley is great at both convincing the audience and herself that she's right.But the truth is that she has been a huge fuckup, first by boning her brother, then killing Robert, then her complete inability to control Joffrey, right from letting him kill Ned, to then having the entire capital pissed off at him.  If she's going to claim "I've been ruling as Regent", then the Regent should have told the guards to take the little boy away and spare Ned's life, etc..  And Tywin, douche though he is, made that clear with very few words.  Can't wait to see Dance's scene(s) with Diana Rigg.

3234	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-04-22	Charles Dance has me completely loving Tywin and Tywin is anything but lovable.  
I am anticipating with much excitement seeing he and Jack Gleason eat up the scenery together in some upcoming episode. Why are they making us wait so long to see those two together?
As a side note: The costumes this season are so incredibly beautiful, including Tywin's black outfit in the last 2 episodes. It makes him all the more imposing. I also had my mouth drop open at Sansa's dress in this episode. It was absolutely stunning, especially with her red hair.
3235	Joyful Union	2013-04-22	I just want Charles Dance to record all the audiobooks. I could listen to that sharp deep voice of his all day long.Charles Dance can make anything sound good.Case in Point: http://www.youtube.c...h?v=fKCSGbX-JRM

3237	Ser Drizztos	2013-04-22	I'm actually going to be sad when Tywin dies.That's how good Dance is.Can't decide between Tywin and Varys as my favorite character/actor on the show; they both fit their roles perfectly.If I hadn't been spoiled already I'd be devastated when Tywin dies.
3238	Talvivaara	2013-04-22	Agreed, the scene with Tywin and Cersei was brilliant!
3239	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	I'm actually going to be sad when Tywin dies.That's how good Dance is.Yea, and a celebration when rob stark does
3240	The Monkey	2013-04-22	Yea, and a celebration when rob stark doesFor me, Cat's death hit me 100 times harder than Robb's. I reckon that will be the biggest tragedy for TV viewers as well, as well as Arya's botched family reunion.OnT, yeah, it was a fantastic scene, strange to think it was the first time those to exchanged words in the show so far.

3242	Nymeria_Snow	2013-04-22	I loved it. That's always been why I loved reading the Cersei chapters- she so wants to be a person in possession of exceptional power but her schemes are never really as smart as she thinks. She's just so deluded but that's why she's such a great character!  /happy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='^_^' />
3243	Er Rn	2013-04-22	Its amusing to me that Tywin seems so irritated by his own children but yet he adored and admired Arya Stark.That's a good point, hadn't thought of it like that.But yes, this scene was great. Can't wait to see some confrontation between Tywin and Joffrey.

Didnt feel that way in the books.
3245	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	Its amusing to me that Tywin seems so irritated by his own children but yet he adored and admired Arya Stark.Possibly because Arya Stark is the biggest BAMF in the history of BAMF's.  Real recognizes real.

3247	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	Yes as much as the books made me root for the North, the show is making me root for Tywin. Not the Lannisters in general. Just Tywin.So agree.  He's out manuverimg everyone, out charisma'ing everyone and generally being that BAMF.

3248	Damar	2013-04-22	I liked the contrast with Arya, as Tywin clearly respected and liked her because she was smart and insightful, and Cersei clearly is not.
3249	Jabronius Maximus	2013-04-22	The tv GoT is making me root against the North and Robb for being dumb and unlikeable.  Didnt feel that way in the books.I feel the exact same way lol he simply takes over every scene he's in. It's gonna be a downer when he goes down for sure. And I've noticed that the show seems to focus more on the Lannisters than the books do; but given the quality of acting in that family I really don't mind as much.Anyone think they're doing this to prep for the inevitable 'Rains of Castamere' episode? In the books i obviously liked the North more, and was blindsided by Robb's and Catelyn's (mostly Cat) deaths. Maybe the show runners are attempting to put the Lannisters in a favorable light to lessen the impact of the RW.

It reminded me of his season 1 convo with Jaime: "[Tyrion's] a Lannister!! He may be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us."
3251	Runaway Penguin	2013-04-22	Dance was great also as Lord Vetinari in Sky One's adaptation of Going Postal... He is simply perfect for scheming machiavellists /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
3252	Sun	2013-04-22	I'm actually going to be sad when Tywin dies.That's how good Dance is.I am going to miss him so much, and so will the show. The Kings Landing setting without Tyrion, Tywin and Bronn will be a very poor place come season 5.
3253	Dove	2013-04-22	Charles Dance is a boss, it says a lot that he manages to make Tywin charismatic even knowing what we know about him.
I loved his scene with Cersei for multiple reasons, but especially because of his grim promise to have "words" with Joff. Aww yeah can't wait for that.
3254	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	"If I would go to war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I would do for my firstborn son and heir?"Tywin is a massive dick to his children, but that line perfectly captures how committed he is to his House and family.

3255	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	I love how it was a nice little hint towards Cersei's incompetence. At this point in the books she still seems like she has a sort of lowly cunning, and is quite intelligent and strong. And then we get that put-down from Tywin.
3256	Swagwell	2013-04-22	Charles Dance can make anything sound good.Case in Point: http://www.youtube.c...h?v=fKCSGbX-JRMBWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!
3257	ThePrinceOfSunspear	2013-04-22	This scene was an amazing scene and one I wish to God had been in the books.....
But I hope people also loved Cersei's part in it too...for all her bad decisions she was right about one thing. She's the only one of Tywin's children who truly LISTENED to what he had to say about family, honor, and legacy.
Cersei more than Tyrion or Jaime actually understands her father and what he wants/expects out of his children. I loved her entire monologue about how she might be the only one paying attention to his lectures and how perhaps she should be the one in his confidence when it comes to his schemes ,etc.  Cersei clearly just wants his love and respect and it's killing her that he denies it because of her sex (in her mind).
3258	Spring Snow	2013-04-22	BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!Oh my god, that's hilarious! Tywin what are you doing

3260	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	Maybe the show runners are attempting to put the Lannisters in a favorable light to lessen the impact of the RW.They have to be.  The Boltons are exceptionally cruel and Karstark is a dick.  Robb is breaking oaths and running from east to west with his army for no reason.  He's mocking Edmure, parading his prisoner mother around for some reason.  There's not a lot to like about King Robb right now.
3261	chris999	2013-04-22	Not in my opinion.I take it more in the place of - whether they include it in the show or not - his dismissing the king from the council chambers and having the KG escort him out. Joffrey may be the King, but Tywin is in charge.I agree.Technically, Cercei is in charge as Queen Regent because Joff isnt of age... but everyone in the 7 kingdoms knows who calls the shots.Tywin is ruling as the Hand, he is the one that the lords respect and fear.
3262	chris999	2013-04-22	I doubt it, but I hope that means we'll get the scene where  he ushers him off to bed and the line "And any man who must say 'I am the king' is no true king at all."Most definitely. They got all of the most experienced actors. Plus Tywin is the best actor on the show now that Ned is gone.
3263	Ramsay Gimp	2013-04-22	They have to be.  The Boltons are exceptionally cruel and Karstark is a dick.  Robb is breaking oaths and running from east to west with his army for no reason.  He's mocking Edmure, parading his prisoner mother around for some reason.  There's not a lot to like about King Robb right now.In almost every interaction Robb has had with his subordinates in the show, he has been chewing them out or brusquely dismissing whatever they say. I'd like to see a scene of him earnestly listening to advice for once
3264	Shitmouth the Wise	2013-04-22	The sharp lesson will coincide with the line we've being hearing joff say in the promos methinks."..they are mine to torment." oh, joff /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />"EVERYONE is mine to torment."I think that will be in answer to Tyrion's line from the book, "She's no longer yours to torment", in reference to Sansa.
3265	jarl the climber	2013-04-22	Whats interesting is that she went to Tywin for this discussion right after the one she had with Ollenna about the role women play in governing. What we are seeing is friction between the Lannisters encouraged by the Tyrells, who are pressing their buttons.

I think Lady Olenna talked it off as joke and Cersei took it way to seriously to even consider herself an equal to her father.
3268	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	What does Tywin even think of Cersei? Does he like her? Does he love his daughter?

It reminded me of his season 1 convo with Jaime: "[Tyrion's] a Lannister!! He may be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us."Oh yes!  The almost non-expression to Cersei could imply that he knows about Cersei/jaime too, and why she is asking.  But what I really loved was the perfect set-up for what happens when Jaime returns. "... my firstborn son and heir" - Tywin has never got over Jaime joining the KG and giving up Casterly Rock and the Lannister inheritance.  He still thinks that he is going to be able to buy off the high Septon (which he undoubtedly can) and that he will be able to browbeat Jaime into doing what HE (Tywin) wants i.e leave the KG, make a political marriage and take over as Lannister heir.   Tywin may be able to out-plot the Tyrells and Varys by (I am assuming) arranging for Ser Loras to join the Kingsguard and have Sansa marry Tyrion instead of a Tyrell, but for once he has miscalculated with his children.

3274	Tony Soprano	2013-04-23	That was a great scene. Lena Heady and Charles Dance are great together, and I'm happy there's finally someone brave enough to scold Cersei for her idiocy. 
I really want to see the two of them more often in the show. Praying for an extended storyline!
3275	Toxspecific	2013-04-23	They have to be.  The Boltons are exceptionally cruel and Karstark is a dick.  Robb is breaking oaths and running from east to west with his army for no reason.  He's mocking Edmure, parading his prisoner mother around for some reason.  There's not a lot to like about King Robb right now.Yes indeed. Pardoning your mother is such a crime, he should parade her naked in Riverrun and lose the support of the Tullys.And as for whether Tywin loves Cersei or not, I think maybe he does but he's very disappointed at how she has dealt with things. Letting Joffrey behead Ned instead of keeping him hostage, letting Arya escape etc all must have pissed Tywin off. He knows she isn't a good leader.

3279	SummerSong	2013-04-23	"If I would go to war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I would do for my firstborn son and heir?"Tywin is a massive dick to his children, but that line perfectly captures how committed he is to his House and family...Agreed. He's a cold hypercritical parent and incredibly blind when it comes to Tyrion, who has skills that a truly wise person would put to good use. He has no grounds to throw stones when it comes to bad parenting. As Cersei said, the Lannister family legacy is what drives Tywin, not the welfare of his individual children or grandchildren. I'm fascinated by what Tywin plans to do to get Joffrey under control. Any ideas about what "sharp lesson" he has planned? I do not believe the PW has anything to do with it. He loves having his family on the IT; he would not jeopardize Lannister power by offing his king grandson except as a last resort in a catastrophic situation. (Mad King Aerys III?) We're nowhere near that yet.It's a tough nut. The Hand of the King has only as much power as the king grants him. Joffrey clearly has a mind of his own, and getting more so. What would happen if Tywin slapped Joff down and he decided to call it treason? I don't doubt that Tywin can come up with an effective lesson, but what could it be?

Tyrion is smart enough but he's a dwarf and doesn't care for Tywin's objectives.
Jaime is a brilliant fighter but he isn't smart enough nor does he care for Tywin's objectives.
Take the best from each of his children and there is his perfect heir....poor tywin.

Actually Tywin says as much to Jaime in season 2 so yes, he believes the Lannisters are bigger and more important than any individual Lannister and he included himself in that.

She is a bitch with power and cunning. Tywin is a bitch /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />  with power and cunning, smarter sure but he's not as smart as he thinks he is either. If he really was smart he wouldn't have been the scumbag he was to Tyrion and how he so many times underrated Robb as a leader.
Tyrion was likely as smart (or maybe even more) than Tywin but he was never cruel.
Jaime is the family's "rebel" yet he's clearly Tywin's favorite.

3292	lannistergold	2013-04-25	Great scene, and so very Tywin. But it also illustrates how overconfident he is - he won't find Joffrey all that receptive to reason or discipline.

3297	mcb	2013-04-25	Great scene, and so very Tywin. But it also illustrates how overconfident he is - he won't find Joffrey all that receptive to reason or discipline.Oh, Tywin could control Joffrey easily enough. There's for example that scene in ASOS, where Joffrey's throwing another childish tantrum, expecting everyone to bow to his non-existent charisma, and Tywin calmly talks around him and sends him to bed. Everyone just follows Tywin's orders and completely ignores the king's protests. Hell, even Tyrion managed to cow Joffrey once or twice.Whether Joff could learn is another issue, but he could be controlled, except that book!Cersei didn't even try to limit her precious, precious boy. (Show!Cersei, conversely, is aware his flaws, but doesn't know how to deal with him.)

3298	Warhawk137	2013-04-25	I should preface this post by pointing out that I'm not saying Tywin is in any way a "good" person...
In many ways, Tywin is something of the paradigmatic patriarch of a powerful family.  And in his conversations with his children we have seen throughout these 3 seasons, you can really see his children as 3 imperfect aspects of himself, which can explain his disappointment in them.  Cersei has his ruthlessness without his cunning and insight, Jaime has his charisma without his tact and subtlty, and Tyrion has his intelligence without his discipline and seriousness.

I think Tywin in many ways in a very ironic character, perhaps even tragic (even though I don't feel much sympathy for him). As Cersei points out in this episode, he loves his family's legacy more than those who are supposed to carry on that legacy, his children. He is a man consumed by ideals, but at the same time this obsession hinders him from actually giving his children what is necessary to live up to those ideals. That is how I think of him at least.

I thought it was interesting that while Cersei was preoccupied with events and the eventual power struggle at Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing, her father dealt with alliances on a larger scale. With one seing the trees and the other the forest, they could have made a great team!

But with Tyrion's scene you can freeze frame it and make out some words. I think there are YouTube videos of it, or at least there was a thread on here on the corresponding episode in which people discuss what words can be made out.

3304	King Kev.	2013-04-26	Any scene with Tywin is a guaranteed winner. Charles Dance is a masterful actor. Hell, Lena Headey is great as well. I loved his whole "You're not as smart as you think you are." line. He realizes Joffrey is a sadistic prick that needs to be tamed, and it's fucking awesome.
3305	ohpooratlas	2013-04-26	Do you remember the first time we are introduced to Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister?  He's gutting a boar (or what I think was a boar, it could be some other game animal) and he puts Jaime in his place and makes that "I need you to become the man you were always meant to be" line.  Ever since that scene I have loved Tywin Lannister. He does such an amazing job in getting the best possible performance out of all the other actors working with him in a scene.I cannot wait for the future scenes with Jofferey and the QOT.  And I cannot wait for a certain post-PW scene. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
3306	nara	2013-04-26	Awesome scene!  As much as I hate deviations from the book (I'm talking to you, Ros) I love everything they've added with Tywin!  It does seem that they're suggesting that he will be behind the PW and RW (the latter in a more obvious way than in the books), but I don't know how much of that is a red herring.  I like the fact that the dialogue hit head on the question of whether Tywin's treatment of Cersei is sexist or just wisdom--that topic has been debated a lot on this forum
On a side note, I'm glad they showed Cersei remembering Jaime and showing concern for him--I felt that was missing in the past few episodes.
3307	King Tyrion I	2013-04-27	Do you remember the first time we are introduced to Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister?

3310	Janicia	2013-04-27	Cersei isn't wrong about the Tyrells.  She felt a Tyrell threat to Joffrey's safety from Olenna's words about sons and from Margery taking Joffrey into potential danger with the crowd.  I think it was just a gut threat, one that she couldn't really articulate, but she felt something ominous in that scene with the Tyrells.  Cersei goes to Tywin to talk about it, and then decides there is no way to explain her gut fear to Tywin, and says the lame thing about Margery manipulating Joffrey.  Tywin, for all of his brilliance, doesn't foresee the events that shatter his family, but Cersei senses them coming, both the threat from the Tyrells and from Tyrion.

Cersei explains how she's the only one of Tywin's children to really heed his advice, and then she actually has a good point, and Tywin disregards it because she's unable to actually present it properly. But she still is right. She looks foolish even though she's the wisest of them all, in this circumstance, in spite of her batshit craziness.
3312	Lady Arwen	2013-04-27	Charles Dance is outstanding. Why is this the first role I've seen him in? Is that a testament to how underused he is in mainstream productions, or do I simply live under a rock?
It will be fascinating to see him try to "stop Joffrey from doing what he likes". Either he'll totally thug Joff and humiliate him beyond belief, or it will be like that scene in the book where everyone expects Joff to back down, but instead he makes a valiant effort to thug Tywin right back. I remember that being a Tyrion POV where Tyrion thinks, "This just got veeeeeeeeeeeeeery interesting" (or something to that effect).

3322	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-22	I think he's not going to play a role, but he was simply there to show Varys can be cruel and dangerous too, in a way he's also showing Tyrion how dangerous he can be.

3323	Ramsay Blow	2013-04-22	Yeah it was definitely a surprise and also shows how far Varys's reach can go. I liked how Tyrion just happened to walk in as he was opening the box. Varys is smooth.
3324	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-22	Yeah it was definitely a surprise and also shows how far Varys's reach can go. I liked how Tyrion just happened to walk in as he was opening the box. Varys is smooth.weren't they talking about tyrion getting his revenge when Varys brought up the story. wouldn't surprise me if he was going to wait to open it, has tyrion walk into his room and thought "might as well" and decided to fit the story into tyrion's situation. as to the opWell Varys says right after "the revenge you want, will be yours in time" to tyrion. so he's telling him that  he will eventually get his revenge on cersei for putting a hit on him, but he's going to have to wait a while. like he did.  I assume that was the sorceror in a box's whole purpose.
3325	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-22	He's basically telling Tyrion he doesn't have enough influence now, but he will in time. After all Tyrion is a very nice weapon for Varys to use against the Lannisters, he doesn't want him doing anything rash and lose his head.
3326	victim	2013-04-22	On top of what the others said, it's a great way of cutting through the exposition with action and motion. A lot of the time, actors are far better with monologues if they're given a task to do alongside it. It also, believe it or not, makes audiences listen more.

3329	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-22	Could he be replacing Maester Qyburn, perhaps?What? No, Qyburn appeared in Episode 1, he will probably stick to his role, treat Jaime's hand and go with him to King's Landing.
3330	GeorgeIAF	2013-04-22	Not a chance, Maester Qyburn was already introduced to us.
3331	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-22	On top of that, I don't think that sorcerer will be doing a lot of... well, anything once Varys is through with him. His necromantic abilities could perhaps come in handy for Qyburn once he takes over Varys' spot, but I think this is reaching, since I always believed Qyburn had necromantic powers of his own which are not akin to the Red Priest's magic (if he really is a red priest, I'm not sure about this either).
3332	Delmas	2013-04-22	I thought for a moment that Varys may use him for something, but as he depsises magic I see this as unlikely.
3333	Lord Varys	2013-04-22	Revealing that sorcerer was kind of cheap. If they had to play on Varys' lust for revenge, it would have worked much better if they had let Conleth hinting at what he did to that guy when he rose to power and influence.
Despite the fact that some people theorized that Varys may have lied when talking about his background, my guess always was that he would have dealt with the man in time. Tracking him down may have been part of Varys and Illyrio's early endeavors.
The real mystery surrounding Varys' cutting most likely is going to be why he was chosen for this ritual, and not some other poor boy.
3334	ViennaGirl	2013-04-22	is it consistent with BookVarys that TVVarys hates sorcery? I guess it is - I can't think of any reason why it's not. I thought that scene was unintentionally funny. He had a wizard. In a box.
3335	theguyfromtheVale	2013-04-22	It's semi-consistent. The line is straight from the books, so it's definitely not made up. But there are a number of fan theories floating around that particular Varys monologue, and there's a number of strange hints (like Illyrio calling Varys a sorcerer) that might go either way.

He had a wizard. In a box.yeah, it's basically consistent with what we get from his story in the books.  My perception is that this may be one place where his dislike of magic is kept at a personal level since it seems to contradict his support for Dany.  He isn't going to work to stop her even though her biggest asset is magic in nature.
3338	FuriousGeorge	2013-04-22	Basically a way of making a sick trailer where Varys gets to say 'Hello my old friend, it's been a long time'
3339	Eric Xayavong	2013-04-22	The context of their discussion was clear once the sorcerer was revealed. Very nice touch.
3340	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-22	On top of that, I don't think that sorcerer will be doing a lot of... well, anything once Varys is through with him. His necromantic abilities could perhaps come in handy for Qyburn once he takes over Varys' spot, but I think this is reaching, since I always believed Qyburn had necromantic powers of his own which are not akin to the Red Priest's magic (if he really is a red priest, I'm not sure about this either).I think pairing him with Qyburn makes a lot of sense.  Qyburn was a relatively minor character.  Then Varys takes off after the events of ASOS, presumably leaving that guy in the box.  So what's going to happen to him?  He'll be found by someone, and it makes sense he'd be found by Varys successor, Qyburn.  So either we assume that Qybrun will simply free this guy, to disappear from the story forever, or that he'll use this incredibly convenient fount of dark magical knowledge for other purposes.  Seems to me this sorceror is the perfect missing link for Qyburn to fill in whatever gaps exist in his necromantic knowledge.  I think that's actually better than the book having what amounts to a hedge wizard becoming a necromantic master on his own.
3341	Longspear Ryk	2013-04-22	Was that not burnt up pyatt pree in the box?
3342	Versiroth	2013-04-22	Honestly, I think the sorcerer was there just to show Varys current influence/power.  It also shows how patient he is when it comes to obtaining his goals.   It's almost foreshadowing the audience later discovering that he's been trying to get the Targaryens back into power all along.
I seriously doubt this sorcerer will ever be seen or heard from again.

3343	Drogo_1	2013-04-22	was the sorcerer a little person?
3344	Kasrith	2013-04-22	He's basically telling Tyrion he doesn't have enough influence now, but he will in time. After all Tyrion is a very nice weapon for Varys to use against the Lannisters, he doesn't want him doing anything rash and lose his head.Which would make him the quarter man... Just doesn't have the same ring to it
3345	Kasrith	2013-04-22	was the sorcerer a little person?No, just thin and frail
3346	Zarniwoop	2013-04-22	Well, I think the sorcerer was there just as an axcuse for them to tell us Varys backround, without him the whole subject would feel pushed. I actualy didn't know where they were going with the box and that explained why he decided to tell him the story now out of the blue

3347	HouseHarrison	2013-04-22	It was just a cool revealing moment. I doubt he'll play any role again. The TV show is not like GRRM where most stuff ends up being relevant.
3348	MaHaBone	2013-04-22	I agree that expositional scenes are better with action, and that showing is always better than telling, but I was a little disappointed that they sorta "collapsed the wave" with this one.  I liked the idea that the sorceror could be another character that would appear later, like Qyburn or Merwyn or Pyatt Pree.  Plus, that Varys could be making the whole story up a la the Joker.
Oh well.
3349	boojam	2013-04-22	So we know this guy was in the books, but Varys never is mentioned even trying to track him down.What possible purpose could this guy have?  What role could he play?Any theories?It's a D and D invention, Varys tells the same 'cut' story in the book, but the book implies that this leads to Varys building a campaign , something BIG, against magic. But I don't know if means he out after the  Great Other and Red God, or what?!(He made the 'magic' vendetta threat before too, in the Blackwater episode.)
3350	darksellsword	2013-04-22	Its abit coincidental Tyrion seeking vengence and exposing his desire to avenge the attempted murder to Varys just at the moment
Varys opens the box. Ive always believed Varys frequently lies about his past and why he was made a eunuch , it wouldnt suprise me
if it was just some guy in the box and the story was total fiction. I really enjoyed that scene thought it was tv gold.
3351	High_Heart_Hag	2013-04-22	Was that not burnt up pyatt pree in the box?That's what I thought at first. But after looking at several screenshots it looks more like Hallyne the Pyromancer. Whomever it is, Varys's point is made and he never acknowledges the man's identity. I found this scene a rather unartful version of the deer scene. That only contributed to a greater feeling that the episode was cartoonish and evoked a comic book aesthetic that didn't jive with the previous episodes (i.e. the storyboarding was too visible/poorly executed). I doubt the wizard-in-a-box willl reappear.
3352	Fez	2013-04-22	I agree that he was only there to show what Varys can be capable of, and I really doubt he'll ever be heard from again.  For one thing, if he were anything more than extra, word about his casting would've leaked at some point.  All the castings get leaked, even the ones where its not totally clear who the actor is playing ahead of time.
On a different note, his presence does blow up some of the more extravagant Varys theories.  Such as that maybe he wasn't really cut, or that it was Marywn who cut him.

3354	EmmaoftheCanals	2013-04-22	I had a bit of trouble making out what we actually see when Varys opens the chest.
We see a face and some kind of spikes? The face seems to be turned the wrong way round considering the orientation of the box. Can't figure it out...
Can anyone help me out?

3355	Akal Colzet	2013-04-23	It was there for the reasons mentioned above but I also think it was there for the benefit of the audience. In the books there is no question that Varys is a dangerous man, the TV audience may have problem taking him seriously and this was done to show that he is not an enemy to be taken lightly.
3356	Stargareyen	2013-04-23	I don't think it is just to prove Varys is a dangerous man or serve as warning to Tyrion that he shouldn't be trifled with...
For one, Varys proves to Tyrion that if you are patient and resilient enough, you will meet your goal one day... Also, it is a way for Varys and Tyrion to bond and realize Varys has influence over Essos leading up smoothly to the events at the end of third book...

In the books there is no question that Varys is a dangerous man, the TV audience may have problem taking him seriously and this was done to show that he is not an enemy to be taken lightly.I always got the impression that Varys , in the books, and now on the show did not want Stanis on the Iron Throne because he did not want a follower of the Red God there.Well that makes sense if it's Melisandre's brand of R'hllor , human sacrifice ? I think there would be another rebellion!Of course there is the seemingly benign brand of  R'hllor (think Thoros of Myr).Ok so here is George making even religion gray, well it happened in our universe, so ...Its all kind goofy, supposedly the Targs (I hope I have this right) adopted the New Gods as a sop to Westeros...I have no idea who the Valyrians worshiped , if any at all.On top of that I don't think GRRM cares much about religion, personally that is.The Sefven seem like a piddling shallow religion, while the Red God and Great Other seem like silly religions.(Well all religions, personal view, seem silly to me.)

3359	crazibouncer	2013-04-24	I think the scene was showing that Varys does not just talk the talk, but he can also walk the walk.  Seriously, do not mess with Varys.
3360	dttljs123	2013-04-24	It means Varys is connected from Asshai and back to KL's. Also he will one day sit the Iron Throne. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
3361	PetyrPunkinhead	2013-04-24	The context of their discussion was clear once the sorcerer was revealed. Very nice touch.Yup. This scene was basically a character/backstory moment for Varys and an excuse to get Tyrion and Varys together for the audience. Originally Varys told this story to Tyrion in S2 (in the Blackwater episode I believe), but it was cut out. I think this version is much better, and the "unboxing" of Varys' greatest and oldest enemy was a truly brilliant way to show Tyrion that revenge is a dish best served cold.
3362	dansnow	2013-04-25	Not a huge fan of the scene. Cool for tv, and doesn't really affect my enjoyment of the episode but it is way to out of character. While I could buy Varys having the sorcerer in a box, there is no way he would show Tyrion. Even though they are sort of allies it is simply a sloppy move in the game. It gives another potentially powerful player a lot of leverage over him. 
Much like Littlefinger, Varys' character in the show is way to sloppy to be the master of the game he is in the books.
3363	Shane snow	2013-04-27	I feel like there's to many questions left unanswered if they just show the guy in the box and leave everyone wondering who it is and Wat varys did wit him
3364	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-27	Not a huge fan of the scene. Cool for tv, and doesn't really affect my enjoyment of the episode but it is way to out of character.

Tyrion tells someone (Tywin?) that Varys has some Essosi sorcerer locked in a box? Who cares? Is he going to blackmail him into doing something unless he reveals his huge secret that nobody cares about?Everyone already distrusts Varys and suspects he knows and withholds too much.
3365	Janicia	2013-04-27	Much like Littlefinger, Varys' character in the show is way to sloppy to be the master of the game he is in the books.While I agree, I think that is unavoidable in the TV interpretation.  Littlefinger and Varys are very clever and very careful.  The kinds of things that they do in the books - the sneaking around, endless conversations with people to get information, endless conversations to manipulate people, the sitting around thinking, the clever bookkeeping - these would be boring to watch.  Even shows that are focused on a small cast of characters that devote themselves to political machinations really struggle to portray interesting, clever, plausible schemes.  GoT has way too much going on to give the scheming justice, and it is better that we see clumsy scheming than no scheming.  The books can give a lot of information without having to prove it because of the point of view structure.  We have never seen Randall Tarly in battle, but we know that he is good in battle because we've been in the heads of a bunch of Westerosi who all believe that he is good in battle.  Similarly, we don't know exactly how much influence Varys and Littlefinger have over the events in ASOIAF because we've never been in their heads.  When something works out to their benefit, we assume that they engineered it.  Since we're not in their heads, we can't see their failures, nor the frantic switching from plan B to plan C,  nor the extent to which they've been lucky, rather than amazingly clever, in their big bets.  But the TV show isn't in anybody's head - it has to show us "real" events as they happen, so some of the mystery that makes Varys and Littlefinger really work as characters is necessarily stripped away.  To me it looks like the wizard in the box had his mouth sewn shut?  Ick!
3366	King Kev.	2013-04-27	The sorcerer might play a purpose later on, but to me, it just seemed like a way to really show us how dangerous Varys truly is. If you doubted him before, you definitely get the sense that this guy really is a force to reckon with.
3367	ServantOnIce	2013-04-28	Varys showing the TV show only watchers how dangerous he really is.  Varys on TV is playing the game very well while Littlefinger is far too sloppy compared to the books.  The Tyrells are also too obvious as Madge is playing, "Gotcha" with Cersei, something she never did in the books.  
Varys trusts Tyrion, you know why? Tyrion hates his father, his sister, and his nephew .  .. Tyrion trusts Varys with secrets because Tyrion wants revenge, revenge against his Father and Sister . . his Father for his hatred and discrimination and his sister for her attempt to have him murdered.   Varys trusts Tyrion because he has Tyrion figured out.
Same way Everyone trusts Sansa, Sansa is an easy piece in the Game of Thrones to manipulate and figure out.
3368	Reposado	2013-04-28	Pretty sure they did it just for filler
3369	Toxspecific	2013-04-28	Odd thing to note, Cersei never once thinks about what is considered her plot to have that Kingsguard dude kill Tyrion in ACOK. Not once.
3370	Frey Pie a la Mode	2013-04-23	Sorry if this was posted somewhere else, but I don't like how they made it seem like Jamie and Cersei's true relationship was common knowledge. Locke making comments about Cersei sticking things up Jamie's bum and loosening him up for them just struck me as odd. I can see maybe a few whispers in KL about them, but Locke's men all laughed like they knew what he was talking about.
I was similarly annoyed that a common watchman would be making jokes about Renly and Loras back in the previous season (again, maybe there was gossip around the capital, but would it be generally known by some random guard?), but this was even worse IMO /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />.
3371	tito5601	2013-04-26	i think because of stannis letters to all the lords that joffrey is jaimes kid with cersie everyone in the realm retty much knows jamie and cersei bang eachother

3372	Broken Fox	2013-04-26	I think it's a common rumor at this point.
3373	Mulled Wino	2013-04-26	Commin rumor certain to be believed and perpetuated by Lannister enemies.  Makes perfect sense.
3374	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-26	I feel like the rumor being generally so widely known will be a factor in Jaime's motivation to tell Cersei to just let everyone know and have it be public. So I sort of like that addition.
3375	King Kev.	2013-04-26	It's a common rumor around Westeros by now. Makes perfect sense to me.
3376	shiola	2013-04-26	Everyone knows.  Stannis sent out the letters in [the first episode of?] season two.

3381	GeorgeIAF	2013-04-27	Jon Arryn found out that they were banging and he was poisoned by Pycelle because of it, if i remember correctly, Tyrion found out about it.
3382	The Monkey	2013-04-27	Jon Arryn found out that they were banging and he was poisoned by Pycelle because of it, if i remember correctly, Tyrion found out about it.Lysa poisoned him, on Littlefinger's request.
3383	Runaway Penguin	2013-04-27	Lysa poisoned him, though there are hints that Pycelle wasn't trying too hard to save him...Might be situation similar to Tyrion murdering Tywin (if he really was poisoned by that time)...
3384	protar	2013-04-27	Lysa poisoned Jon on LF's behalf, but it was Jon's snooping around and investigating the incest that allowed LF to cover his tracks by implicating the Lannisters. Otherwise I doubt he would have done it at that point.
3385	Kienn	2013-04-27	LF used Jon's death to start the war on purpose. He told Lysa to poison Jon and told Lysa to send a warning to the Starks, instigating the Stark vs Lannister conflict which would bring more of the realm into war and give him opportunities to expand his influence and power.
As far as the OP, the rumor was widely known because of Stannis' letter. Officers discuss it with guards around, guards discuss it with other guards and everyone else. Same for the Loras/Renly affair earlier on.
3386	boojam	2013-04-27	Before Stannis' letters, it was not a common rumour, I think probably Varys, LF and Tyrion knew, as you say, but it is not like other people knew.

Hence the seed is strong.From there his suspicion led him to do a bit of research and he was coming to the conclusion that if the kids aren't Robert's who else could they be? Who's the other man that has been with Cersei long enough to father three children with golden curly hair. Who would she love enough to accomplish this with?
3388	Runaway Penguin	2013-04-27	Stannis suspected. He initiated Jon Arryn's search. However... Whatever whoever suspected, it didn't make it out of relatively closed circle, out of whom most people probably thought that hinting something to Robert without proof is a certain way how to get an appointment with Ser Payne.

3390	Daynestar	2013-04-27	Two things, what made Jon Arryn suspicious?It was Stannis who started it off - the appearance of Edric Storm made him suspicious. He was very familiar with him as he was fostered at Storms End and looked very much like a young Robert in stark contrast to all his 'trueborn' children. But he knew Robert wouldn't believe him, which is why he went to Jon Arryn first. Littlefinger then had Lysa murder Jon (with possible collusion from Pycelle), so Stannis fled the capital and began gathering his strength. In the TV series though, it seems that Stannis found out from Ned's letter to him and that Jon Arryn came to his own conclusions without Stannis' help.

I don't think so... he would be either too drunk or to occupied with examining poor girls in his chambers to dust off just to pursue Cersei. More like he would be talking about how he swung his warhammer and crushed Rhaegar.
3393	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-27	^ Lol! I don't think so... he would be either too drunk or to occupied with examining poor girls in his chambers to dust off just to pursue Cersei. More like he would be talking about how he swung his warhammer and crushed Rhaegar.Robert is only good at one thing. He drinks and whores his life away because being King in peace means you do everything but fight, which is the only thing Robert could do. He would relish the opportunity, I think. Or maybe even those days passed for him? I don't know, that's a part of his character I like. Is he totally washed up or does he still have some of his prowess?
3394	Janicia	2013-04-27	In both the books and the show, it is revealed that the incest rumor has spread widely.  In season 2, Tyrion watches a street preacher talking about the incest (that may have also happened in the book, I don't remember?).  During Cersei's walk of shame, the smallfolk of Kings Landing refer to her relationship with Jaime.  There is also a council meeting in the second book where LF suggests spreading a counter-rumor about Stannis being cuckolded by Patchface.  The rumor was to be spread from the brothels, so it would become common knowledge just like the incest rumor.
3395	ShigellaSand	2013-04-28	At this point, I suspect the only ones who haven't heard the rumors are Sansa and Tywin. (Okay, maybe some wildlings as well. And Tommen/Myrcella.) Sansa because the Lannisters pretty much control every scrap of information that comes her way, and Tywin because, well, who would dare be the one to tell him?
3396	DrRobotnik	2013-04-22	Exceedingly charismatic and memorable actor, and the eye-patch prop reinforces that.
However, I have concerns that the eye patch may lead non-book people to confuse Beric with Euron Crow's Eye when he's introduced.
Thoughts?
3397	Jamie Lannister	2013-04-22	I don't think it'll be an issue. They'll probably sex Euron up even more than the books do.
3398	TheEvilKing	2013-04-22	Seems like a good fit for the part, but god did he have some cheesey lines in this episode. Next week should be dope though.
3399	Mediumjon Umber	2013-04-22	I think Euron will have more of a classic eye-patch and not a bandage like the one Beric's sporting. I don't think people will find it confusing.
3400	Greywolf2375	2013-04-22	Yeah, I don't see an issue with having multiple people with covers on their eyes - especially with how/when they get introduced and the difference in how the characters will be presented.  Eurons I would not be surprised to see a gem or something in, not a ratty rag tied around the head.
It is a good question considering how Asha's name was changed to avoid confusion, but with the number of injuries/maimings/etc that happen, I think that is one thing people will be able to identify.
3401	Frumpus	2013-04-22	we don't even know if euron will even be a character on the tv show

3404	Flayed Starkman	2013-04-22	HBO seems to think that the regular unsullied TV watchers are stupid, or at least easily confused. They can't be that stupid though.
3405	Sweet-N-SourRobin	2013-04-22	Nah because Euron's patch will be over the other eye.
Obviously totally different character /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
3406	Dragonstoned	2013-04-22	I like him although he is different in demeanour to the sombre Beric in the books.  So is Thoros and I don't think it's really a problem; the BWB will get all dark under Lady Stoneheart anyway.
3407	Kasrith	2013-04-22	If they look nothing alike, the eye patch won't be enough to fool people. 
I swear sometimes I think you guys come up with 'problems' just for the sake of problems /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
3408	Tyrion4President	2013-04-22	Yeah, I don't see an issue with having multiple people with covers on their eyes - especially with how/when they get introduced and the difference in how the characters will be presented.  Eurons I would not be surprised to see a gem or something in, not a ratty rag tied around the head.It is a good question considering how Asha's name was changed to avoid confusion, but with the number of injuries/maimings/etc that happen, I think that is one thing people will be able to identify.why was ashas name changed again? does it have to do with ashara dayne?
3409	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-22	why was ashas name changed again? does it have to do with ashara dayne?Because Asha and Osha sound almost exactly the same.
3410	Our Blades Are Sharp	2013-04-22	Too close to Osha...so they changed it to Arya...o im sorry I meant yara...
3411	Toxspecific	2013-04-22	Exceedingly charismatic and memorable actor, and the eye-patch prop reinforces that.However, I have concerns that the eye patch may lead non-book people to confuse Beric with Euron Crow's Eye when he's introduced.Thoughts?Then they can change Euron's name to solve the problem. lolJoking of course, Beric was truly Beric! I imagined him to look younger, but I guess being stabbed and burned does that to you.
3412	A bowl of brown	2013-04-22	Is it a differennt actor from the Beric who was briefly in season 1?
3413	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-22	Is it a differennt actor from the Beric who was briefly in season 1?Yes, different actor. The original actor I don't even think speaks a line and he appears for about 3 seconds total, so fortunately they can get away with it.
3414	A bowl of brown	2013-04-22	Cheers, thought it was.
Most nonreaders probably wont remember him from season 1 anyway it just seems a little odd to put him in it and then change actors. Though I suppose it may be difficult to get a decent actor to appear for 3 seconds then have no screen time for the next season and a half
3415	Sphinx The Riddle	2013-04-22	we don't even know if euron will even be a character on the tv showLOL! People also said no Reeds because they cant be patient... to not have Euron.... would be stupid and to think they may not include him.. is even stupider..
3416	Darryk	2013-04-22	Awesome introduction, and the actor's got the character nailed.
3417	Frey Pie a la Mode	2013-04-22	It's cool because he's a GOOD guy with an eye patch! The intro of an eye patch so often screams "Villain!" (Like the Governor in The Walking Dead /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />)
3418	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	If they look nothing alike, the eye patch won't be enough to fool people. I swear sometimes I think you guys come up with 'problems' just for the sake of problems /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />Here here, i mean wtf???Euron and beric will be almost impossible to confuse.  One always in pyke or on a ship, one hiibg in the woods, then goes away.
3419	Fez	2013-04-22	He was a very different character from book-Beric, but very awesome.  Its easy to understand why so many would risk all to fight for him and his cause.
Its just a shame that he probably won't get very much screen-time though.  But that's a common "problem" to have, the series has just been amazing at casting the various roles; and its these various tertiary characters, like Beric, or Balon, or Salladhor Saan, that really make me wish that episodes were two-hours long each.
3420	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-22	One thing I particularly liked about that scene was the way the Hound's face fell a bit when Beric said he'd be taking the challenge.  Nice way to communicate to the audience that Beric is a serious tough guy.
3421	Pilz	2013-04-22	I don't see how those two will be confused.  Euron will be very pirate-like most likely.  He will show up with a big dragon horn and a bunch of other exotic stuff.
3422	WheelofIceandFire	2013-04-22	What is going to happen to Arya after the trial in the next episode?. I cant remember how and when the Hound captures her in the book. Arya attempts to run away from the brotherhood in the book, but in one of the trailers there was a shot of her holding a bow with a couple of men next to her. Do you think they will have Beric decide to send her to Riverrun (or the Twins) with a group of men from the brotherhood, who then get attacked by the Hound (who i remember seeing attack someone in another teaser).
They really need to feature her at the RW so they have to have The Hound find out that Edmure is getting married and Robb/Cat will be at the Twins

3423	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-22	Beric will be gone by the time Euron is introduced.
3424	kephv	2013-04-22	First thing I thought when I saw him is that he looks just like Les Stroud the Survivorman. Which is perfectly fitting for the character, I suppose.
3425	Iotun	2013-04-22	I thought his lines were a bit cheesy to be honest. Also I thought the character seemed awkard, I didn't like how he held himself, his hands seemed unnatural by his side.
Eh, nitpicking, I really don't mind.
3426	Broken Fox	2013-04-22	I thought the actor did a good jobThis will always be how I picture Beric though http://fc08.devianta...rion_by_mcf.png
3427	A Real Dire Wolf	2013-04-22	Was it just me or did he seem way less... beaten up? I mean, he just seemed like a dude who'd lost an eye, not a brutalised zombie.
3428	Mother of Mountains	2013-04-22	I guess they're going to show us that, I bet he looks different after his next resurrection. They're bound to show us one as a intro for UnCat.
3429	briantw	2013-04-22	Was it just me or did he seem way less... beaten up? I mean, he just seemed like a dude who'd lost an eye, not a brutalised zombie.He also had the scar on his neck from the noose.
3430	Conchobar	2013-04-22	Some of the accents in this show are weird!
Beric's accent is like a weird Irish/ English accent. So is Barristan's and Cat's, and Littlefinger's.
Great depiction of Beric though, gave me goosebumps.
3431	Spring Snow	2013-04-22	I don't know anything about the actor but I really enjoyed Beric's voice and delivery. He's quite promising.
3432	shiola	2013-04-22	Was it just me or did he seem way less... beaten up? I mean, he just seemed like a dude who'd lost an eye, not a brutalised zombie.Probably too much money to CGI him, and it might seem a little weird or even off putting for nonreaders.
3433	Holy Sock	2013-04-22	Some of the accents in this show are weird!Beric's accent is like a weird Irish/ English accent. So is Barristan's and Cat's, and Littlefinger's.Great depiction of Beric though, gave me goosebumps.That's because the actors are Irish and they're sort of trying to put on English accents.
3434	lostinwesteros	2013-04-22	I'm probably the only one with this reaction, but I just wanted Beric to have basically the same body type as he did in Season 1.  And I may be remembering that incorrectly, but I thought he was taller and thinner.  And I, too, thought he looked a little too good...but I didn't notice the rope mark around his neck.  I'll look for that, as I know I need to go back and watch it again at least one more time.
Other than that, I liked the way Beric interacted and presented himself.  So, I'll get used to his appearance, and it'll be fine.

3436	shiola	2013-04-22	diff. actors Brah..Yes, and he/she is saying that they wish this new actor was more similar to the old actor.
3437	shiola	2013-04-22	I didn't think his dialogue or character came off very strong..  It felt rushed, and I didn't feel like he was as important as he was in the books.  I'll be proved wrong next episode, I'm sure, and I'm excited for that.  But for now I'm kind of opinionless on him.  I like the rest of the BwB though, and their "hide out" is bad ass.
3438	The Mondrian Oak	2013-04-23	Yes, and he/she is saying that they wish this new actor was more similar to the old actor.God, hadn't I known they are not the same person, I would have NEVER noticed. Expecially since Beric appeared in season 1 for what, 30 seconds? I would have thought that battles and resurrections had taken its toll on him, nothing more.
3439	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-23	I think the severity of his wounds will be revealed in the duel--maybe he loosens his collar up and we see a horrific wound. The Hound notices and has a momentary "wtf?"...cue blazing swords..."WTF!!!" 
Also, there's a snippet in trailers/promos where Arya's lying on the ground, Gendry beside her, and shrieking at the Hound. I'm curious how she got there.
3440	hollowcrown	2013-04-23	I can't even remember what he looked like in Season 1. He looks awesome here though. Seems like a small guy but one who inspired loyalty from the Brotherhood and fear from the Hound.
Badass dialogue too.
3441	stu1987	2013-04-23	From the little we saw of Beric in the latest episode, I totally didn't take to him at all. Thoros and Anguy have been incredibly charismatic so far, whereas Dondarrion seemed pretty poor. Hopefully he'll get some sharp dialogue and decent scenes to work with though.
3442	SerMudz	2013-04-23	I can't even remember what he looked like in Season 1. He looks awesome here though. Seems like a small guy but one who inspired loyalty from the Brotherhood and fear from the Hound.Badass dialogue too.Im not sure why The Hound would fear him though? I mean, its not like he's ever established as a formidable warrior in the books - in fact, he's been hacked to bits by various Lannister bannermen (The Mountain, Amory Lorch, Burton Crakehall etc). The guy has a history of getting the crap kicked out of him.
3443	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2013-04-23	Each to their own I guess, but I really liked the Beric introduction. I loved the "That's what we are! Ghosts!" speech.
3444	Joyful Union	2013-04-23	Its just a shame that he probably won't get very much screen-time though.  But that's a common "problem" to have, the series has just been amazing at casting the various roles; and its these various tertiary characters, like Beric, or Balon, or Salladhor Saan, that really make me wish that episodes were two-hours long each.Very true. I'd love to see Balon again, Patrick Malahide kicked ass. Maybe we'll get to see his death scene?
3445	MisunderstoodFrey	2013-04-23	I only just realised Dany and Cersei were different people. I mean, their hair sort of looks the same. Confusing stuff.
3446	MisunderstoodFrey	2013-04-23	Also, there's a snippet in trailers/promos where Arya's lying on the ground, Gendry beside her, and shrieking at the Hound. I'm curious how she got there.Hound wins. Arya thinks he's guilty, does a typical badass thing and runs forward to attack him, and somebody takes her to the ground to stop her.
3447	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-23	Hound wins. Arya thinks he's guilty, does a typical badass thing and runs forward to attack him, and somebody takes her to the ground to stop her.Works for me!I don't think Sandor was scared of Beric, just surprised and not immediately dismissive...hadn't they been getting reports of Beric dying in a myriad of ways?
3448	shiola	2013-04-23	Each to their own I guess, but I really liked the Beric introduction. I loved the "That's what we are! Ghosts!" speech.I liked the speech a lot.  But not the delivery.
3449	shiola	2013-04-23	Also I think Sandor was maybe not so frightened of Beric, but he was off put from the start because he's fucking surrounded by fire.
3450	Asch	2013-04-23	From the little we saw of Beric in the latest episode, I totally didn't take to him at all. Thoros and Anguy have been incredibly charismatic so far, whereas Dondarrion seemed pretty poor. Hopefully he'll get some sharp dialogue and decent scenes to work with though.I share your opinion.Beric ranks among my favourite characters in ASOIAF. The way we have been teased about him was just extraordinary : his raids, the contradictory tales about his possible death, the Lannister's utmost desire to hunt him down. And then we had his first appearance: stepping from a shadowy corner, wounded, taking off his armour, setting his sword ablaze, the understanding that he actually really died several times. Man I just love him so much.I hope he is going to take off his armour next week thus revealing his devastated body.The actor was charismatic in this episode, but I want him to bring Dondarrion to the next level of charisma.

3451	Toxspecific	2013-04-23	Beric doesn't look small. Guys, he's standing infront of Sandor freaking Clegane. Any man would look small.
And their fight was bloody awesome in the books. Sandor winning but taking some damage. Epic stuff.
3452	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-04-23	I can't even remember what he looked like in Season 1. He looks awesome here though. Seems like a small guy but one who inspired loyalty from the Brotherhood and fear from the Hound.Badass dialogue too.The actor playing Beric did a great badass because he underplayed it.  No boasting, no humor, nothing except a relatively flat affect and letting his presence speak for itself.  I know a few people who are in a similar line of work (so to speak) and he had that demeanor down perfectly.  It was a nice contrast with the fun, entertaining Thoros.  Beric may have been a flashy guy in AGOT, but the Beric of ASOS was much quieter, with more of a presence about him.
3453	WheelofIceandFire	2013-04-23	Hound wins. Arya thinks he's guilty, does a typical badass thing and runs forward to attack him, and somebody takes her to the ground to stop her.I really hope this happens like it does in the book. I want to see Arya actually attempt to attack/kill him with someone's knife (or even sword) but have a feeling that she will just scream at him or something.I just want Arya to become as dark as she does in the book /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
3454	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-23	It was the fire that was frightening Sandor. The prospect of fire.
3455	King of Hats	2013-04-23	Shouldn't Sandor have been more apprehensive about Thoros than Beric?...iirc, Thoros beats him(maybe a few times) in meles with his burning sword?
3456	Kasrith	2013-04-23	Probably too much money to CGI him, and it might seem a little weird or even off putting for nonreaders.Ya this, he wouldn't be much for the Hound to be worried about fighting if he looked like some half rotten dude.
3457	Kasrith	2013-04-23	I think the severity of his wounds will be revealed in the duel--maybe he loosens his collar up and we see a horrific wound.

I'm curious how she got there. Guessing he guts Beric, is free to go as per the trial, and she isn't happy about that.
3458	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-23	I know the Hound is a little more restrained in the show, so I'm curious if they'll have him crying over his burns. It will make me very sad but be very awesome.
					
					
							Edited by PhoenixFlame, 23 April 2013 - 04:44 PM.
3459	Kasrith	2013-04-23	I hope that's in there, they've emphasized already that people are not black and white, and sympathy has been felt for characters previously despised, so having the Hound cry about his burns would be an excellent touch. 
I think viewers already really like him, having him break down would really hurt people watching.
3460	Underzaker	2013-04-24	My main concern is people mistaking him for the governor /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
3461	Rain of Castamere	2013-04-24	i was shocked by berric.
how much he has changed.. wow..
is it even the same actor as in s1?
i mean he looks way older, not like "were going to age you up a little bit and give you some battlemarks with makeup" but more like theres a whole lifetime between s1 and s3 berric..
again, this is the same actor?
3462	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-24	^It's a different actor. RIchard Dormer now, the previous guy was just a stand-in.
Beric is appropriately badass in his first introduction but in the next few episodes we'll see if his weariness of life is brought across. Beric is a charismatic figure who is a hero to the Brotherhood but inside I feel he knows he's putting up a front, to hide the reality.
So yes, so far so good from Richard Dormer but we'll see. I also know that (tv spoiler):
	Spoiler  He will be appearing in 5 episodes. My best bet would be Episodes 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10. Uncat seems very likely.

3466	DrRobotnik	2013-04-24	Thanks for the responses, all.
The reason I asked is because Beric in the series looks a bit like how I envisaged the Crow's Eye. Eyepatch and the black beard, in particular. 
Although I suppose that Beric will start to look more and more zombie-like and this question will become moot.
3467	Rain of Castamere	2013-04-24	^The Hound crying had better be in. And of course, the cut to credits has got to be Beric Dondarrion staggering to his feet.Nice. Also a Final Fantasy IX fan?no not the FF one. it originates from something else for me.
3468	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-25	Is it just me or does putting an eyepatch on a character immediately make him 20 percent more awesome? Beric just walked up there and immediately owned the scene with his charisma - it was weird because he was so different from how I expected, but I think he was very easy for viewers to accept, at least to me he was, even though (or maybe because?) he was as casual as someone taking a stroll in the parc. This Beric was simply very easy to accept for me as a character that suddenly just walks in there, I don't think the half-zombie kind of Beric would have had the same effect. Props to Richard Dormer, I look forward to seeing more of him.

Not only does his eye patch make him look more awesome (by at least 45% in my book) but also his voice is about as cool as it gets. And on top of that, the Hound looked almost fearful when he heard he was going to fight him.A slight departure from the books, but it's so cool I don't care. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
3470	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-25	Same here, I liked Beric in the books as well though. Truly a man who gradually loses everything, but perseveres. It takes some guts to go up against the Mountain, and you can only imagine his pain considering everything he goes through, yet he presses on and finally even gives his life in an attempt to save someone else... which didn't turn out that well, but hey, he had good intentions and it was a brave decision /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
It was also kinda hilarious hearing all these stories about how he had 'died', and then finding out all of them were likely true... Plus 'the Lightning Lord!' Coolest nickname (if a little generic, but it just fits so well) yet, no?

3472	Masamune	2013-04-25	Exceedingly charismatic and memorable actor, and the eye-patch prop reinforces that.However, I have concerns that the eye patch may lead non-book people to confuse Beric with Euron Crow's Eye when he's introduced.Thoughts?Yup, just like your average viewer being unable to differentiate 'Osha' from 'Asha', having two unrelated characters wearing eyepatches would be a total mindf*ck.
3473	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-25	Yup, just like your average viewer being unable to differentiate 'Osha' from 'Asha', having two unrelated characters wearing eyepatches would be a total mindf*ck.I disagree. Two actors that look nothing alike and share only a head accessory in common is not confusing in the least. Now if they cast a Richard Dormer clone as Euron, then you have a point.
3474	TomBadgerlock	2013-04-25	we don't even know if euron will even be a character on the tv showI don't reckon he will. I doubt they will introduce Vic, Euron and Aeron. I think it'd be easier to have Balon replace Euron and have a Vic/Aeron mix.
3475	BericDondarrion	2013-04-25	The original Beric in season 1 looks much better then this guy.Beric is supposed to be a 22 year old lord, this beric looks wayyyy to old.
3476	GoodGuyA	2013-04-25	The original Beric in season 1 looks much better then this guy.Beric is supposed to be a 22 year old lord, this beric looks wayyyy to old. How would you look if you went through what he did?
3477	mankytoes	2013-04-25	I thought the "we're the ghosts line" was ott, aside from that he looks cool. I'd still always support The Hound against him, of course.
3478	Kasrith	2013-04-25	The original Beric in season 1 looks much better then this guy.Beric is supposed to be a 22 year old lord, this beric looks wayyyy to old.I don't think it matters how he's supposed to look, that means nothing to viewers. What he's supposed to do, especially in that scene, was drop Sandor's jaw when he found out that he was fighting him and this guy totally did that. I applaud the change.Looking forward to the duel, s3Beric is going to be way more effective in convincing me (and I'd assume viewers who don't know what he's supposed to look like) about being a decent opponent against the Hound in a Trial by Combat - s1Beric would not.All we need now is the real Mountain to come back...
3479	Randyll Tarly	2013-04-25	How would you look if you went through what he did?Agreed! Dying five times in a row in ways that would crush your body, I doubt you can keep such a handsome and young looking body regardless of your age.The we are the ghost line was cool. WHen he mentioned that to Clegane, the first thing that pooped into my head was the We Are the Champions chorus from Queens. As how the dialogue and accusations progressed, it was obvious he was the only one taking the challenge against the Hound. After all from all the members of the BwB, he has been the only one to be brought back.
3480	Randyll Tarly	2013-04-25	All we need now is the real Mountain to come back...I have started to miss him! He should appear at least once taking insults from Tywin for abandoning Harrenhal.
3481	BericDondarrion	2013-04-25	How would you look if you went through what he did?He looks no different then any other regular guy except he has an eye patch on.Again, not impressed on the new actor.The original guy was fine IMO.
3482	KRANG202	2013-04-25	Ya not really impressed. Beric always seemed to be more ghostly and other worldly. Taller for sure too. Young but aged beyond his years. Strong but melancholy. 
That actor just looks like a grizzled old man soldier. Not liking the choice at all.
3483	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-26	Do they mention Beric's height in the books? Richard Dormer isn't exactly short - 5' 11". But the Hound is 6' 10" so makes pretty much anyone look tiny.
3484	White Harbors Wrath	2013-04-26	I don't really like the length of his facial hair. It's ruining my immersion.
3485	'96Buck	2013-04-26	I thought his lines were a bit cheesy to be honest. Also I thought the character seemed awkard, I didn't like how he held himself, his hands seemed unnatural by his side.Eh, nitpicking, I really don't mind.Get killed and raised from the dead repeatedly, look as good, you will not. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
3486	'96Buck	2013-04-26	Ya this, he wouldn't be much for the Hound to be worried about fighting if he looked like some half rotten dude.I dunno...the Hound was surprised to see Beric at least in part since supposedly the Mountain had already killed him...as much as the Hound hates Gregor, anyone who Gregor has failed to kill would scare him.
3487	Calidad	2013-04-26	I think the scene and the character was done very well. Although, I think when he was introduced to Gregor, Gregor could have said "Beric Dondarrion?! I heard you were dead" That would have fit quite nicely there.
3488	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-26	I disagree. Two actors that look nothing alike and share only a head accessory in common is not confusing in the least. Now if they cast a Richard Dormer clone as Euron, then you have a point.Have you heard of sarcasm...?
3489	Conchobar	2013-04-26	He looks no different then any other regular guy except he has an eye patch on.Again, not impressed on the new actor.The original guy was fine IMO.lol, except for the fact he was only an extra and probably had no real acting experience.

I have no clue who he is, but I will say quite confidently he's not as good as Dormer. I would take good acting over superficiality any day, and in the show universe who cares how old Beric Dondarrion is?Have you heard of sarcasm...?I have, and I missed it obviously. Given the quality of some other people's posts it wasn't out of the realm of possibility that you were being serious /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

3494	theREALjonsnow	2013-04-23	Two questions that must be answered before episode 5 " Kissed by Fire"
Will Yrigtte's carpet match the drapes?
What will happen after Sandor kills Beric? (besides being kissed by fire... i.e what will he & arya do? does he steal her or will she willingly go with him to Riverrun/The Freys
3495	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-26	Arya will probably get caught by the Hound as she's trying to escape from the Brotherhood, I don't see her going with him willingly, that would be dumb. Or she could escape and he could then 'save' her from Polliver (and maybe a few extra Lannisters), who still has Needle and thus has to die.

3496	'96Buck	2013-04-26	Arya will probably get caught by the Hound as she's trying to escape from the Brotherhood, I don't see her going with him willingly, that would be dumb. Or she could escape and he could then 'save' her from Polliver (and maybe a few extra Lannisters), who still has Needle and thus has to die.My guess is more the latter, she escapes, then "Lions" catch her, then Sandor appears.  Easier way with fewer new characters and sets.
3497	Versiroth	2013-04-26	They could go ahead and mingle in the new Melsandre/Gendry plot.    The hound kills Beric and is then released.   Gendry goes missing (captured by Melisandre) and Arya sneaks away to look for him only to be captured herself by the Hound.
3498	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-26	He'll steal her but it won't be next episode. I reckon Kissed by Fire will end with Beric Dondarrion staggering to his feet.
Also, who will tell Tywin of the Tyrell's plot? Please make it Littlefinger.
3499	Versiroth	2013-04-26	I doubt they would make the Hound save her from Lions.   They will probably want non-book readers to believe that the Hound plans on doing something bad to Arya.   Either hurting her, or turning her over to the Lannisters.   They'll then give the audience some hope once they learn that she's to be returned to her mother.  And then......   BAM!!!  The red wedding poos all over their happiness. /devil.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':devil:' />
3500	victim	2013-04-26	Also, who will tell Tywin of the Tyrell's plot? Please make it Littlefinger.My guess is he attempts to get Sansa to come with him, she says, "No, I'm marrying Loras," and he tells Tywin.
3501	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-26	Also, who will tell Tywin of the Tyrell's plot? Please make it Littlefinger.Seems unlikely... He was too busy to even notice his 'loss of income', after all /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
3502	'96Buck	2013-04-26	My guess is he attempts to get Sansa to come with him, she says, "No, I'm marrying Loras," and he tells Tywin.And so, she shoots off her mouth to the wrong person, again, with romantic stars in her eyes, again, and hoses herself, again.

The red wedding poos all over their happiness. /devil.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':devil:' />He could save her from Polliver et al w/o breaking audience belief that he wants to redeem her with Tywin himself to get back in to favor.
3504	juanml82	2013-04-26	In the books, during the fight, isn't Arya who ends up saving the Hound after the fight begins? That would be cool to see. Too bad she has less questions to make. I hope they make justice to the book scene - we've already lost too much of Arya (and her soups)
3505	Versiroth	2013-04-26	He could save her from Polliver et al w/o breaking audience belief that he wants to redeem her with Tywin himself to get back in to favor.That whole scene is supposed to come after the red wedding.   It's the event that eventually kills Sandor even.  It wouldn't be as powerful and meaningful a scene if it happens before he attempts to take Arya to the Twins.

LF smiles and gives his congrats ( in his head he thinks... ok first ill tell tywin. then mention that loras should be KG & he should marry her to imp. then ill team up with QoT to kill Joff. then ill take my prize in the chaos. o yea and ros ive found out u work for Varys cause why else whould they rush to steal the lions prize unless the spider whispered to the rose)I doubt they would make the Hound save her from Lions.

3511	Mulled Wino	2013-04-23	Love the dynamic,    The scene was pretty much straight from the books, which makes it an auto-win.  The actor playing the Hound is amazing.  I believe his bravado and that he isnt afraid of anyone.  
I do kinda miss Lem and his piss colored cloak though.  
Im enjoying this storyline thoroughly so far and cant wait for more scenes with these two.
3512	shiola	2013-04-23	Same :]  Rory is such a fantastic actor.  I love The Hound.
3513	Lady Sansa Stark	2013-04-23	I'm so much looking forward to their journey together. Really, really looking forward. Her changing opinion of him always interested me in the books. How she stopped saying his name in her prayers.

How she stopped saying his name in her prayers.There's NO WAY the Hound can be bad if Arya decided not to kill him.I prefer their journey to pretty much every other one.  Even jamie-brienne, and especially tyrion's lol.
3515	WheelofIceandFire	2013-04-23	I love both actors (Maisie and Rory) and Maisie has had great chemistry with everybody she has worked with (Sean Bean, Charles Dance, Tom Wlaschiha etc) so i hope we do get to see a lot of their journey together. I would hate it if they decided to leave out the Inn in the next season (i know the tickler is dead but she could just kill Polliver).
I can see the Hound capturing her in episode 6 or 7. It looks like Beric sends her off with some men from the brotherhood and they are attacked by the Hound (Arya is seen with some men, holding a bow, in the woods during one of the previews and the hound is seen fighting someone in daylight, and neither has happened so far so he propably captures her when she is being escorted to riverrun or the twins). I seem to say it a lot, but i really want Arya to have more screentime this year (to build to her arrival at the twins) and would be upset if she just has a two minute scene with the Hound between episode 5 and episode 9. I would be even more upset if they decided not to include her in that episode, but just cant see that happening. Ending with her being knocked out and making it look like the Hound has killed her would be a great cliffhanger

Maybe she'll quote some of his conversation with Lommy when she kills him, since asking him the Tickler questions wouldn't make much sense.For example, she could stab him in the legs several times while screaming, "CAN YOU WALK?"

Ending with her being knocked out and making it look like the Hound has killed her would be a great cliffhangerMan, they need to have the Inn scene in episode 10 of this season. It brings home the point that the Starks' cause isn't completely a lost after the RW, and nicely shows how all the shit Arya has been through has messed up her psyche.OnT, yeah, I loved the scene, and my all indications, the Beric/Sandor fight next episode will be the best duel this show has seen yet.
3520	sastelise	2013-04-23	I love the brief glimpse of fear on the hound's face when they take off his hood and he sees the fire, followed by the utter contempt and fearlessness he expresses towards his captors. Great acting!

3527	Harrad	2013-04-23	I'm so much looking forward to their journey together. Really, really looking forward. Her changing opinion of him always interested me in the books. How she stopped saying his name in her prayers.In GoT the only thing she could condemn him for was riding down Micah. He explained that away with "I vas only following orders." On the whole he seems to have saved more Starks than killed, so no wonder he drops off her list. Now that Jaime has veered in that direction...who's next? It wont be Tywin or the Mountain...mebe Sersei?
3528	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-23	What I love about the Hound and Arya are their similarities. Arya didn't have her face burned off, but she had to flee and fight to stay alive, much like Sandor fled his home when Gregor inherited. Sansa and him are similar in that they used to believe in stories and are now more disillusioned (though unlike the Hound, Sansa's not bitter about it). With Arya, her similarities lie in her rage and pain. 
Regarding the end of of ASOS with Sandor and Arya...
	Spoiler  I didn't interpret her abandoning him as gleefully forcing him to suffer. Sure she was mad he didn't try to save her mother, but she'd already taken him off her list. Both of them were full of bluster--the Hound and his breakdown speech and Arya's cold "maybe some wolves will find you." Just my opinion though.

I've always thought that there stories were similar too, all three were raised on stories of "True Knights" only to be betrayed by those same knights. Sandor and Arya become embittered, it remains to be seen how Sansa reacts. At the end of Dance, they are all in similar places, too-not literally of-course, but none have their identities, they are all essentially faceless and nameless, all are wanted and all three in hiding. It will be interesting to see where they go from there.
3530	wolverine	2013-04-23	The Hound has been played just about perfectly.
A couple of the non-book readers I know watching the show have Arya as their favorite character.  More scenes with them together should be great.
3531	Juliads	2013-04-23	Rory is amazing as the hound.  I hope they do his character justice after turning him into a silent piece of furniture for most of season one and two.
3532	lil_z	2013-04-23	A couple of the non-book readers I know watching the show have Arya as their favorite character.

I'm hard pressed but I think Arya is and will continue to be the best storyline/character with a Dany as the close second.
3533	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2013-04-23	I don't think the inn should be this series. There will be enough fallout from the RW as it is so Ep 10 will have a lot going on.
I wouldn't mind if the last scene of the series was
	Spoiler 
a wolf running through the forest hunting something ahead that you can't quite see. The wolf comes up to a pond and looks in. It sees its own face and the face is Arya.
Would be mind=blown for viewers, it would justify Bran's story and it would be a forshadowing of the 'blind girl' events later.
I doubt they will do it though.

3538	Rapsie	2013-04-24	Rory is amazing as the hound.  I hope they do his character justice after turning him into a silent piece of furniture for most of season one and two.This so much. He's one of the best characters in the book and it's such a shame his character got no delvelopment in Season 1 & 2.

That, sir, is brilliant and would be amazing no matter where/when they decided to show it. It would have a slap in the face effect even if it wasn't the season ender...What did the Hound mean when he referred to Micah as a "bleeder"? It sounded like an excuse to me.It's just the Hound being 'raw' and remembering the butcher's boy, but not caring particularly about his fateI saw the RW coming a mile away. I preferred the Hound/Arya part of the RW anyway.You are more observant than I. I literally changed emotions mid sentence and was shocked...
3543	towerofjoy	2013-04-24	The Hound and Jaime couldn't be more different but I see them both as the disillusioned types that have given up on honor in others and themselves. But every once in while, they are reminded and behave truly like knights.

3546	scurvy	2013-04-24	Sandor is outstanding.  Bugger the writers for taking away so much of his interaction with Sansa and giving his story to Littlefinger.   He could have told her Bugger on your Ser and told her how he was burned, opening himself up; but at the same time threatening to kill her if she ever told anyone.
Sandor is one of my favorites in the books as well and Arya is my favorite, so I'm really hoping for lots of scenes without adulteration.  But, they could easily screw this up, like they did Jon Snow and Quorin last season.

But every once in while, they are reminded and behave truly like knights.Am really looking forward to how this develops character-wise!The South to North travels of Arya and Sandor and North to South travels of Jaime and Brienne are very much opposite sides of the same coin.  Both become more like their captors.  Arya becomes more like Sandor: a killer who is driven by revenge.  Jaime becomes more like Brienne as he becomes more and more honorable along the journey.  Those two trips are what make SoS so great for me; the transition of both sets of characters.
3548	Delmas	2013-04-24	What did the Hound mean when he referred to Micah as a "bleeder"? It sounded like an excuse to me.Its not a excuse at all.  It is essentially trash talk.  Saying he bled a lot when he killed him, essentially rubbing it in Arya's face.
3549	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-24	Yeah...I liked their part of the RW more. I was a tad cold toward the real RW because I didn't particularly like Robb or Cat. Still an amazing scene, but I didn't have the "throw the book across the room" response some readers did. But when Arya and the Hound arrived, I was "OH SHIT!"
I'm hoping they get more into his character. He made a comment once that D&D were unfolding the Hound more slowly, but that he definitely gets unfolded. I hope the unkiss stays in too--Sansa can either dream about it (like when she had her moonblood) or just coyly allude to it when Randa asks her. Cue viewers to be "whah??!?!" and drive up YouTube hits.

Between the somewhat cryptic description of the massacre and setup,  Sandor and Arya fighting Freys, Sando having to regulate and control the almost uncontrollable Arya, the brutal dialogue of Sandor, and Arya's inner thoughts, I was forced to read it about 3 times to digest everything.Rory's portrayal of Sandor is raising my personal ranking of Sandor Clegane in the ASoIaF book universe.  Not even Dance has done that (because Dance is excatly like I picture Tywin).
3551	Matthew Marzolf	2013-04-25	Their outside RW chapter is one of my favorites too. The shit hits the fan and the Hound shows his true colors. He's a man of action, doesn't hesitate, cuts his horse free and fight's his way out and despite the realization Arya's ransom potential just took a shit, he pulls her ass out too. No fear, no hesitation to save one of the few companions he's had. As far as honor, I don't think the Hound ever had a disdain for it so much as it's trappings. He was more of a deeds person.

3556	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-25	Sandor, Sansa, Jaime, Brienne, and Arya are like a pentagram of weird connections and contrasts.
3557	Frumpus	2013-04-25	Arya-Hound storyline was my absolute favorite in the entire series. Really hope they don't screw it up in S4.

3559	Head of The Ned	2013-04-26	It was a good scene, I haven't read the books but the Hound looks completely afraid when he finds out he has to duel that one eyed man. I'm guessing he is a BA?If you haven't read the books, get away from this forum as fast as you can. There're spoilers everywhere.You have been warned. Seriously dude. Or lady.
3560	Great Winter Knight	2013-04-22	Ok So it has been awhile since I read the 3rd book, but did Varys know about LF plan for sansa?  Not to mention that since Rob is still alive whom ever marries Sansa is not getting Winterfel, does that point to more families being part of the Red wedding.  I say this because at this point in the show Rob is still alive and there are people fighting over who will get Sansa as a wife.  In the book its because she is the heir to WF, so it makes sense to try and wed her.  But at this point in the show there is no reason except to try and have Sansa talk to Rob or create some sort of Northmen strife.  
Anyone got any ideas?
3561	ShigellaSand	2013-04-22	In the book Robb was still alive when people were fighting over who got to marry Sansa off to their kid. He has no kids, which does make Sansa his heir.The thing is, Robb is at war. He's at war with the Iron Throne and the Lannisters, who have the backing of the Tyrells and an alliance with Dorne. I'd guess most people, especially those siding with the Lannisters, assume he's not going to make it out alive. They may not have been prepared for the RW, but they knew there was a significant chance Robb was going to die... which made Sansa a prime target for marriage shenanigans. And it's not as if they'd lose anything by marrying a son to her, so why not take the chance?
3562	Grandpa House	2013-04-23	To answer your original question, the book doesn't say that Varys knew about LF's plot, though this doesn't mean that he wasn't actually aware the whole time. Also someone else had a good theory that LF's initial Sansa-escape-plan is gonna fall through when she is married Tyrion, so that when he later takes her away after the purple wedding it will still be a shock and something Varys/no one would know about.
3563	victim	2013-04-24	It's never explicitly stated that he knew but we are talking about Varys here. The man has his fingers in just about every pie and he's always known more than he lets on. I wouldn't be shocked if he knew about the RW before it happened as well.
3564	Kernest	2013-04-24	And in the books we don't have a POV to whom Varys could reveal this information, that's probably the biggest departure here.
3565	AdiTarg	2013-04-24	I do think that LF knows that Varys knows, and he wants Varys to try and stop it. 
The thing is, in the books, everyone thinks that LF is away, so no one suspects him. I think that is what will happen here, he will be "away" and Dontos will make a comeback.
3566	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-24	Also someone else had a good theory that LF's initial Sansa-escape-plan is gonna fall through when she is married Tyrion, so that when he later takes her away after the purple wedding it will still be a shock and something Varys/no one would know about.I thought that was fairly obvious.Although I'm wondering how the Littlefinger - Queen of Thorns dynamic will work. Varys has just warned her about him...and she's now going to turn around and ignore his advice! Consorting with Littlefinger...she may well lose a few fans in the process. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

3567	Janicia	2013-04-24	The Tyrells never trusted LF further than they could throw him.  They coordinated the PW with him, but that was at least as much in their interests as it was in his, and they made sure that Sansa and Tyrion  would take the fall for it.
3568	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-24	The Tyrells never trusted LF further than they could throw him.  They coordinated the PW with him, but that was at least as much in their interests as it was in his, and they made sure that Sansa and Tyrion  would take the fall for it.Exactly. But going into any bargain with Littlefinger is always a risk.A cautious woman, having listened to Varys, would have stayed well awary from Lord Baelish and all his scheming. But then the Queen of Throrns is not a cautious woman...
3569	Sun	2013-04-24	In the books there was nothing to suggest that Varys was aware of LF's scheming regarding Sansa.
3570	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-24	I created a new thread but sometimes they don't go through. So here is my idea of what's really going on with Littlefinger:I think I've worked out Littlefinger's ploy. You see, it never made any sense him suggesting that he take Sansa to the Eyrie straight away because how would he get away with it? The second Sansa disappears, everyone will wonder who could have done it and Tywin most certainly would realise that it's Littlefinger.Instead, I think Littlefinger suspects he has a spy in his midst (Ros) and is trying to rat her out. Consequently, he leaves a false trail of immediate plans to take Sansa with him to the Eyrie and uses this as bait for Ros. This would not only make Littlefinger appear like a dangerous player of the game but it also reconciles his unusually cavalier approach of late.If my theory is right, this is bad news for poor old Ros - because Littlefinger is already many steps ahead of her.
3571	shiola	2013-04-24	It never says so, but it never says many things regarding Varys.  I just assume if something's happening in King's Landing, he probably knows about it.
3572	jugdesh258	2013-04-24	I think that in the book Varys is deceived like everyone else lest it would seem that everyone would know that Sansa went to the Vale and her disguise was bunk.  She is a suspect in Joffrey's  death.
Unless we are going to assume he knew and was also protecting her....even though he is not fond of littlefinger. 
He knows now so that might be something he has to wrestle with..
3573	Harrad	2013-04-24	The Tyrells never trusted LF further than they could throw him.  They coordinated the PW with him, but that was at least as much in their interests as it was in his, and they made sure that Sansa and Tyrion  would take the fall for it.Wait...Its implied that Margaery was aware of the PW plot but not certain. It always seemed a bit too much even for her. Still this is GoT.
3574	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-04-24	The situation is the same as the books, there's more people that believe Bran and Rickon are dead at this point in the books but besides that, it's the same, Robb is wed, his wife is not prego yet and Arya has been missing a long time. Plus Sansa is above Arya in inheritance of Winterfell.The simple answer is no, Varys doesn't know LF planned to get Sansa out of KL. If he did know that LF wanted to get Sansa out Varys never figured out the details of it.Wait...Its implied that Margaery was aware of the PW plot but not certain. It always seemed a bit too much even for her. Still this is GoT.Margaery was drinking from the same cup as Joffrey that contained the poison, she most definitely 100% knew what was going down.

3576	Mulled Wino	2013-04-24	In the books there was nothing to suggest that Varys was aware of LF's scheming regarding Sansa.Exactly, there is evidence suggesting Varys didnt know anything about it.
3577	congokong	2013-04-24	I think the only thing Varys didn't know was that Ned would lose his head.
Ok, he may not have known. The same could be said about the Purple Wedding. Littlefinger was very cautious but Varys often just sits on information and does nothing with it. Ex: I'm pretty sure he knew Ser Mandon Moore was going to try to kill Tyrion during the Battle of the Blackwater, but he did nothing to stop it.
Actually, that's one point in favor that Varys never treated Tyrion as a friend, because he realized Tyrion was just using him like almost everyone else. That was probably why he respected Ned Stark, who was honorable and didn't come to him asking for secrets. Instead he went to Littlefinger for help and we know how that went.

Sansa is their most valuable hostage right now.Finally, the Tyrell's and Lannister's finding out about the plot doesn't necessarily mean that LF has a spy, it might mean that Sansa was dumb enough to tell someone.A nice idea in theory but I doubt that is what is going on.To answer your original question, the book doesn't say that Varys knew about LF's plot, though this doesn't mean that he wasn't actually aware the whole time. Also someone else had a good theory that LF's initial Sansa-escape-plan is gonna fall through when she is married Tyrion, so that when he later takes her away after the purple wedding it will still be a shock and something Varys/no one would know about.LF's initial escape plan fails because Margaery puts the idea of marrying Loras in Sansa's head and her getting to go to Highgarden. The Tyrell's plot fails because someone tells Tywin of that plot and he counter plots it.I'm pretty sure in the books Varys didn't know about LF's plan to take Sansa to the Vale.  Or at least it was never mentioned that he knew.  As soon as Roz told him about the extra feather bed, I was like "woah, this didn't happen in the book!"LF didn't have a plan to take Sansa to the Vale with him initially, so Varys indeed did not know about it. Ros didn't exist in the books so indeed that didn't happen in the books.Exactly, there is evidence suggesting Varys didnt know anything about it.Of course you have to wonder how much Varys knows that he just doesn't bother to do anything about. Varys is absent from the docks when the riot happens Tyrion notes.

As soon as Roz told him about the extra feather bed, I was like "woah, this didn't happen in the book!"That it was never mentioned, I agree. However, it is not clear that Varys didn't know. It seems contradictory that he would keep that information away from Cersei, since LF is his rival, but, then again, he proved he does not like Lannisters by killing Kevan. I always had the impression that Varys always knew more than he revealed. In fact, I believe his main weapon is to reveal only the necessary information to the right person, in the right moment, such that, people never loose interest in him.As for Olenna, it makes perfect sense to me that, from the moment she plans the PW, she knows that Sansa and Tyrion will be blamed. Therefore, using Sansa to gain the allegiance of the north becomes and infeasible choice. She has no reason to allow Cersei to put her hands on Sansa, so it might be possible that the price of LF to help in the orchestration of the PW is Sansa. TQoT may also underestimate LF, by not believing that he is capable of giving Winterfell back to Sansa, and that way, breeding another title for him.

We can assume anything we want, but people assume varys knows eeeeeverything and its a little old.  Lf is a player in his own right and has gotten away with things before.Lf was absent as well for whatever reason.  Varys just cant be the only person that knows EVERYTHING.  Its so tedious and makes for a pretty lame game if we just assume he knows everything.

3583	Montey14	2013-04-24	I think Little finger had already hashed this out with the tyrells when he got them back  the iron throne.....It's kind of interesting that in the books robb admits a terrible mistake in not swapping jamie for his sisters and marrying her off to Loras to gain their backing......

You're right that it wouldn't be entirely convincing as there are other possibilities, but Ros is certainly a dispensable asset.So yes, LF does want to take Sansa with him. But he's a clever man - and the plan that they supposedly uncover is far too stupid to be his actual plot.Of course, the possibility remains that D&D haven't really thought this through all that carefully. I hope that is not it - but it's very possible.

3586	Mammothsbane	2013-04-25	Ros is the only one who would know about the 2 featherbeds?Well the show made it seem like Ros was running the letters, but there would have to be other people loading the boats and stuff. Unless Littlefinger is doing all the physical labor... which he probably isn't.
3587	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-25	Ros is the only one who would know about the 2 featherbeds?We don't know - but she could well be (other than the guys who make and carry them). But what I'm saying is that Littlefinger would never ever dare to take Sansa to the Eyrie at the same time as he was leaving himself. That would be madness as everyone would know that he was the one who stole Sansa.So either he bought the feather beds in advance for a later plan or he bought them to weed out Ros as a spy. I think the latter would be a cooler storyline and more in keeping with his extremely sharp and devious nature. But the former is probably what will play out.The absolute worst situation though, would be if D&D suggest that Littlefinger was planning to take Sansa with him there and then. Because that would be akin to Littlefinger purposefully screwing over himself.

Would a dangerous man:a) Concoct a stupid plan that will never work/cool.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='B)' /> Leak said plan to Ros without suspecting her or noticing that she took his inventory list with herI hope not.
3592	Newstar	2013-04-25	It seems like in the books there was one plan and one plan only (hairnet/Joffrey's wedding), and that it was in the works way back, since Dontos approached Sansa in the first half of ACOK.
On the show, based on the information we have, it seems like there will be two plans:
Plan A: smuggle Sansa out on a ship when he leaves for the Eyrie (will fail when Sansa refuses to leave with him)
Plan B: hairnet/Joffrey's wedding
My problem with Plan A is that Varys seems to be acting as if Littlefinger is stealing away Sansa to marry her. Isn't he heading to the Vale with the promise that he will woo Lysa Arryn? Wouldn't marrying Sansa instead be a bit of a problem, for both Lysa and for Tywin, who sent him on the errand? (As Littlefinger pointed out, taking her would be treason.) Also, if Sansa disappears, right about when Littlefinger leaves the Vale, is there going to be any question at all as to who took her? It wasn't  clear in the books because Littlefinger wasn't known to be in KL. If he leaves and Sansa mysteriously goes missing, everyone will know where she went, and Littlefinger would be accused of treason. Finally, the show has made a point of showing Sansa accompanied by two guards at all times. How is Littlefinger going to get around that?
One convoluted way this would work is if Plan A was never intended to be anything more than a ruse to put certain things in motion.
1. Littlefinger approaches Sansa with a plan to escape KL, supposedly to take her with him. He says he "might" be able to take her, meaning I think that if she doesn't wind up refusing him then he can just tell her that the timing is off and it won't work this time.
2. Ros (either acting as double agent or spilling information Littlefinger hoped she would spill) goes to Varys with her suspicions as to Littlefinger's intentions.
3. Varys goes to Olenna, who proposes a Loras/Sansa match (as Littlefinger probably figured she would).
4. Loras is engaged to Sansa.
5. Littlefinger goes to Sansa to fetch her, supposedly, and she refuses on the basis that she's to marry Loras...just as planned, as Littlefinger never had any serious intention of leaving with her at this point, anyway. I think Littlefinger is counting on her to refuse at this point.
6. Littlefinger leaks this information to Tywin.
7. Littlefinger leaves KL, having affirmed his loyalty to the Crown (and thwarted the Tyrells).
8. Tyrion marries Sansa.
9. Littlefinger somehow gets the purple hairnet to Sansa, PW proceeds as otherwise planned.
Of course, this depends on a lot of things Littlefinger might not have been able to reasonably anticipate, and he's also counting on Varys not openly accusing him of trying to spirit Sansa away, but if "Plan A" were nothing more than a roundabout way to get to his real aim and objective, then it would make Littlefinger look like the genius he is. It's one thing to nab her when she isn't trying to escape a horrible marriage and isn't wanted for murder: better to narrow her options first.

3593	Shadow on the Wall	2013-04-25	6. Littlefinger leaks this information to Tywin.7. Littlefinger leaves KL, having affirmed his loyalty to the Crown (and thwarted the Tyrells).I love this idea. I don't think the pathway you suggested is the only solution - there are quite a few (as I've suggested). But using the leak as a way to curry favour with Tywin would be a great idea from Littlefinger's end. We know next episode that Tywin will uncover the plot. If it's Littlefinger who tells him that would be excellent - although I won't get my hopes up.
3594	Newstar	2013-04-25	It would be even cooler if the "leak" was a situation Littlefinger had deliberately engineered by creating a set of circumstances that would lead to a Loras/Sansa engagement, rather than an improvised response to Olenna doublecrossing him.
There was a Varys/Littlefinger scene in the throne room shown in Season 3 trailers. Maybe Varys confronts Littlefinger about his shenanigans and realizes he's been used as a stepping stone for Littlefinger to get in good with Tywin. Brilliant! Varys will be all "But what about Sansa?" and Littlefinger will be all "What about her? You're talking to the future Lord Protector of the Vale, bitch!" Hopefully, there will be some mic-dropping involved.

Hopefully, there will be some mic-dropping involved.I wouldn't get your hopes up. D&D have done a fantastic job with the asoiaf series but Littlefinger has been one of their weak links. I definitely think he is salvageable but until I start to see that happening I won't get too excited.But yes, I'm a huge Varys fan and would love to see that scene. The two of them should be much more equal in intelligence than the show portrays.EDIT: Actually, looking back. Littlefinger season 1 wasn't bad. I think the main problems were in season 2. So hopefully soon he'll be back on track.http://www.youtube.c...h?v=1LXu-0X8ECw

3597	boojam	2013-04-25	The Tyrells never trusted LF further than they could throw him.  They coordinated the PW with him, but that was at least as much in their interests as it was in his, and they made sure that Sansa and Tyrion  would take the fall for it.That's one of the oddest things in the books. It seems evident, tho I am still not sure, that the PW was a Tyrell - Little Finger conspiracy (tho there are those who think Tywin was mastermind of his grandson's own death).After the PW LF is gone gone gone.My suspicion is won't survive events at Erie , tho I don't know in what way.Also Vary's 'King of the ashes' seemed like a hyperbola that Olenna did not really believe.What Vary's is after in the teleplay has spins on it that are not in the book, but that's ok with me.
3598	zaphodbrx	2013-04-26	Personally I have given up on Show-Littlefinger.
The show clearly shows us that his main area of expertise is whore management. He's not that much into plotting and planning or being clever or subtle. In fact in the  previous episode he practically tells Tyrion this, that financial management was 'just numbers', while whores are the 'real challenge'.
He has no proper people skills ( see his scenes with Catelyn/Cersei/etc. last season ).
He's not devious in the slightest. Stay within 10 yards of him and you will know everything he's planning.
In short, this is nothing like the character from the books.
This isn't personal, other characters have been dumbed down a lot, though not that badly..
Varys, for instance, requires Ros to point out the two feather beds on the ship.
He then jumps to two absurd conclusions. First that Littlefinger was going to marry Sansa ( hey idiot, he's going to marry Lysa ), and that this would give him control of the Northern army. That's like Viserys levels of stupid, as if he was going to command the Dothraki army because his sister married the Khal.
Tyrion is another example. He does not ever keep track of what he pays Bronn or Pod and is pretty much incompetent in being master of coin. He said it so himself, being a rich playboy doesn't exactly qualify you to be the treasurer..
I don't know where they are going with this, all the characters are in desperate need of an IQ boost. Perhaps a night with Ros should do it?
3599	Joyful Union	2013-04-26	Exactly, there is evidence suggesting Varys didnt know anything about it.like what?
3600	Mulled Wino	2013-04-26	like what?He was offerring gold for info on her whereabouts or to anyone who would produce Sansa.
3601	Lady Lu	2013-04-26	I got the feeling that Varys was offering gold for information on Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s whereabouts more for Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s benefit than his own. The book doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t tell us if he knew about the plot or not, although as others have pointed out, there wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t much that Varys didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know about.
Whether Varys knew about the plot beforehand or not, I do think it is safe to say that Alayne Stone wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be alive and well at the Eyrie if it didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t serve his ends in some way.  Littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s natural daughter shows up at the same exact time Sansa Stark goes missing? Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a year older and has brown hair instead of red? Please. Varys could put together a better disguise and backstory in his sleep.  If Myranda Royce could find out that an Alayne Stone had shown up at the Eyrie (Myranda was away from home, apparently gadding about the countryside in the middle of the war, when Littlefinger & Co ascended the mountain), then itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a safe bet that Varys did too.
3602	irishtemper	2013-04-21	So since the Old Bear didn't get to be held by Sam the slayer for a long time while he died and didn't impart on him his dying wish of having his son Jorah join the Nights Watch.
Does that mean(confirm) Sam will never get to tell Jorah and he'll never join the NW?
3603	TheBastardofBluegrass	2013-04-21	Possibly, but more importantly was that Edd who was stabbed immediately after the fight broke out?
3604	Kasrith	2013-04-21	Possibly, but more importantly was that Edd who was stabbed immediately after the fight broke out?What? Better not have been... Need a rewatch now for sure
3605	Funkagenda	2013-04-21	What, no I can't imagine they would kill Edd. /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' /> Would be is bad luck I guess.
3606	TheBastardofBluegrass	2013-04-21	I swear, I thought Edd winced right after Aurochs charged the main guy
3607	Jabronius Maximus	2013-04-21	I don't think it was Edd...I thought that dude named Rast laid the smackdown? The guy who keeps calling Sam 'piggy'
3608	TheBastardofBluegrass	2013-04-21	I'm waiting for a feed to buffer so I can re-watch!
3609	Funkagenda	2013-04-21	Who was that guy who called Craster a bastard anyway? Just a random ranger or something more?
3610	Kasrith	2013-04-21	Who was that guy who called Craster a bastard anyway? Just a random ranger or something more?Just some plot device to get the stuff going, showing that it wasn't just Rast who was against the LC
3611	Darth Pipes	2013-04-21	Random ranger.  He appeared for the first time last week, holding the hilt of his sword outside of Craster's and looking at his daughters omniously.
Rast seemed like the right guy to be part of all this.  The scene played out really well.  I'm only sorry we didn't get Mormont's final words to Sam.
3612	Lord Godric	2013-04-21	Who was that guy who called Craster a bastard anyway? Just a random ranger or something more?Owen Harper Yeah, just some random Night's Watch guy with attitude.  We saw him last week too mouthing off.
3613	scurvy	2013-04-21	I'm not sure when and if Sam will kill an Other.  Maybe the Other will come for the baby and that's when he'll do it.  But, without other NW around to see it, it will just be a story.
3614	#Fire and Blood	2013-04-21	Where was puddles?!  Are we not going to get to see that?
3615	tito5601	2013-04-21	i dont think edd is dead, i mean i hope not, i obviously was sad mormont died, i didnt like craster at all hes a bad guy in my opinion but i still dont think he deserved to be killed by the people who he gives them hospitality..... which is why i felt bad when he died too
3616	Ser Greguh	2013-04-21	I'm not sure when and if Sam will kill an Other.  Maybe the Other will come for the baby and that's when he'll do it.  But, without other NW around to see it, it will just be a story.Grenn (and possibly Edd) could still catch up to Sam.  He doesn't run that fast.  That would possibly mean that it's not just Sam + Gilly (and her baby) that meet up with Bran at the Nightfort, but there are easy enough workarounds for that.
3617	MoA«t	2013-04-21	Just some plot device to get the stuff going, showing that it wasn't just Rast who was against the LCThat's Burn Gorman, one of the main dudes from Torchwood.
3618	teej6	2013-04-21	Possibly, but more importantly was that Edd who was stabbed immediately after the fight broke out?I highly doubt it.  If so, why introduce him in the first place?
3619	tallTale	2013-04-21	That scene was a nice reminder that the Night's Watch are comprised of "bad men".
It's easy to forget that there all a bunch of former rapists and murders when all you see are the honest  and kind hearted Jon and Sam.
3620	Winterz	2013-04-21	To be honest we're kinda directed to sympathize more to the rebels cause in the show. In the books they were already plotting before the Fist but in the show that freakin' Craster was starving them as he continued to live the good life. I think Jeor should've taken some measure because the NW may need Craster but so does he need them, and besides, they could easily overpower him.Though I loved that part when Craster gets all mad with his axe and everyone shuts it, pretty badass, respect!Does anyone the name of the show-exclusive character that killed Craster. I understand this was asked before but it's likely that an actor that plays in at least 2 episodes and with a rather significant role should have a name for who he was cast to portray. Also that white-bearded guy at the entrance, does the character have a name? I remember seeing him in Season 2 and I believe he's one of the NW's tops (he looks like a ranger so perhaps Jarmen Buckwell or a Thoren Smallwood who survived?)..Anyway,RIP Jeor Mormont, 997th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />  And goodbye James Cosmo, wonderful acting skills (they should cast him as Vic! /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />).

I understand this was asked before but it's likely that an actor that plays in at least 2 episodes and with a rather significant role should have a name for who he was cast to portray.Not a show exclusive character. He was Karl. The character in the books that killed Craster was Dirk, but Karl was another co-conspirator.I'm guessing Karl and Rast along with a few other extras will later be killed by Coldhands, perhaps in ep10.

3625	Zman1863	2013-04-21	I thought that the scene seemed to rushed. I guess it's meant to create suspense about whether Grenn and Edd survived. I suppose we won't see anyone from the watch again except Sam and Jon for the rest of the season or whenever Jon gets back to the Wall. I'm not going to read much into J. Mormont's final wish. That's a question in the books that geographically looks as unlikely to ever being fulfilled as anything. Even if it does somehow come to fruition, it isn't completely necessary to introduce it as it was in the books.
3626	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-21	How often do things in the books ever happen as planned? Obviously Jeor's dying wishes were never going to come true.Not a show exclusive character.

That's a question in the books that geographically looks as unlikely to ever being fulfilled as anything. Even if it does somehow come to fruition, it isn't completely necessary to introduce it as it was in the books.That's just such a memorable scene from the books and a much better death for the LC, even if it is unlikely to have any further relevance to the future of the books.The show is staying nice and gritty though. Last wishes from stabbed, dying men have become a bit cliche in the world of cinema. Maybe that's why they left it out.
3629	Nezzer	2013-04-22	Oh thank goodness.

3630	Dove	2013-04-22	Burn Gorman did great, even if his role ends in the next couple of episodes I'm satisfied
The tension was palpable in those few seconds of silence, then "... bastard." awww hell
3631	ExileOnDaytonStreet	2013-04-22	I thought that the scene seemed to rushed. I guess it's meant to create suspense about whether Grenn and Edd survived. I suppose we won't see anyone from the watch again except Sam and Jon for the rest of the season or whenever Jon gets back to the Wall. I'm not going to read much into J. Mormont's final wish. That's a question in the books that geographically looks as unlikely to ever being fulfilled as anything. Even if it does somehow come to fruition, it isn't completely necessary to introduce it as it was in the books.I agree with most of this, but I'm not too worried about it.  The seeds of discord were sowed in the previous episode, and for how short the seasons are that's enough for me.  Mormont's dying wish has yet to be relevant in the books, so it might just be one of those things that gets cut just because (a) it might not really matter much down the road and (/cool.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='B)' /> it probably wouldn't fit for Sam to pause for a final chat with Mormont during a scene when he needs to be getting the hell out of there.Overall, I liked the scene and how it played out.  The only knocks on it where how quick, rushed and random it seemed, but if we're being honest about it... doesn't "quick, rushed and random" kind of seem to be in keeping with the Mutiny?  Sure there was more rabble-rousing about the LC in the book, but beyond that, it was a very near sighted thing for the NW to do.  The way the scene plays out is kind of fitting, no?All in all, my only real gripe with the NW business so far this season is that I wish that, despite all the other things clamoring for money from the show's budget, I wish we could've seen more of the Others/White Walkers attack on the Fist.  I'm sure it was just a budget issue, and they've written around it as well as they can, but this storyline still suffers from it.As for other Sam stuff...I'm not sure when and if Sam will kill an Other.  Maybe the Other will come for the baby and that's when he'll do it.  But, without other NW around to see it, it will just be a story.I was perfectly fine with how the mutiny scene played out (as noted above), so I'm more worried about Sam getting his Slayer moment.  He's still got plenty of time for it and there are any number of ways to play the flight back to Castle Black that could still give us that moment of Sam finally showing his courage.  I'll refrain from judgement from the absence of that one until the end of season 4.  Or until Sam kicks ass and takes names.  Whichever happens first.
3632	ExileOnDaytonStreet	2013-04-22	Last wishes from stabbed, dying men have become a bit cliche in the world of cinema. Maybe that's why they left it out.Not a bad reason to leave it out, IMO.

3634	Angmar	2013-04-22	It was a very tense scene...Out of all the gruesome fights and deaths we've had in the show, this is the only that really made me flinch at. Happened the same while reading the book... /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />
And now we'll wait for the Sam the Slayer scene; if it's done as this one, it'll be pretty darn good.

3636	zaphodbrx	2013-04-22	I just rewatched that scene with 'You are a bastard. A daughter f*king, wildling bastard'.
Thank you! random Night's watch extra. You said it like it was.
Could have put in a line about being in league with white walkers too.
3637	Zerrex	2013-04-22	Good scene, very tense.
I liked how Mormont still managed to turn and grab his killer. The whole thing really held up to his namesake. The same goes for Aurochs loyalty charge.
Also, yeah, it happens really quickly but Edd gets his weapon out and into the guy attacking him from behind, was a nice move, his bad luck hasn't caught up to him yet.
3638	Zombie	2013-04-22	Hmmm I can admit I am a bit of a book purist and I did want to hear the Old Bear's dying wish.  However, in the books I remember Jon Snow mentioning the Old Bear left notes on some people of the Watch for the next LC to be careful of.  Who is to say he didn't leave a written will and testament to be carried out by the next LC... you know something like:"While I am grateful for Ned Stark of Winterfell for sparing the life of my son Jorah, let my last wish be known that I ask the King (of the North) to lift his exile and let him return home.  Let him take the black so he can stand up and protect his family and countrymen from the shadows I now know lurk beyond the wall.  I have no doubts that the Nights Watch will need every man to face the dangers men have long forgotten in these coming days."Something like that gets the wish across and it would be nice to see a reaction from Jon Snow as he reads this to himself aloud.As for the line. "We never knew! But we must have known once. The Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch has forgotten its true purpose, Tarly. You donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t build a wall seven hundred feet high to keep savages in skins from stealing women.

Where and when remains the question I look forward to seeing in the series.  The how is obviously obsidian/dragonglass. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
3639	Mediumjon Umber	2013-04-22	Sitting on the floor, crying like a child and holding Mormont's head in his lap is the last thing TV Sam needs right now. They've already established that he's an unbelievable wimp and staying true to the book in this regard would only make him look even worse! Immediately going after Ginny after all hell broke loose showed us he still has balls. Maybe we'll get to see Sam the Slayer after all.
3640	Delmas	2013-04-22	Possibly, but more importantly was that Edd who was stabbed immediately after the fight broke out?Looked like Grenn grabbing Edd, in a "lets get the hell outta here" fashion to myself
3641	Bannerman918	2013-04-22	Just some plot device to get the stuff going, showing that it wasn't just Rast who was against the LCIsn't that Dirk?
3642	victim	2013-04-22	My favourite part of the scene was Grenn running to attack Burn Gorman moments after Rast stabs Mormont. I've always like Grenn, but I've never truly loved him until right now.
3643	Greywolf2375	2013-04-22	I just rewatched that scene with 'You are a bastard. A daughter f*king, wildling bastard'.Thank you! random Night's watch extra. You said it like it was.Could have put in a line about being in league with white walkers too.Not everyone might actually know that though - everyone could see he was sleeping with his daughters, not all of the NW might have known he was sacrificing his sons to the WW.I think the way they will have the Sam the Slayer scene is with him blubbering as one comes up, Grenn and Edd close enough to see but not do anything and Sam pull out the dagger and stab blindly as he did in the book.  I really do hope they don't "brave him up" for the scene - standing between Gilly and the WW as a defence.
3644	Dragonstoned	2013-04-22	Gutted they didn't have Mormont's final words! Maybe they thought it was too cheesy but it was a poignant moment in ASoS.

And now heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s here, but we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know how to fight him."While I would have preferred hearing it from the Old Bear, it is a line that Jon Snow can take over at any point really, probably after Sam the Slayer relays how he actually killed an Other.  Where and when remains the question I look forward to seeing in the series.  The how is obviously obsidian/dragonglass. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />I sign on to this interpretation. I do think GRRM will come back to this dying wish. At the very least Jorah will hear about it, and I could definitely see him taking the black - particularly if Dany doesn't wind up on the Iron Throne and needing a queensguard.
3647	guppy	2013-04-22	I thought it was a rather nice, perhaps symbolic image when Mormont fell dead next to Craster in a Ying Yang kind of way (if i saw that right). 
Mormont in a way only has sons (the NW brothers) while he shuns girls. Craster only has daughters and shuns his sons. There is something incestuous about both groups, granted Craster less metaphorically so. 
Mormont defended the law and new order against the white walkers from his side of the wall, Craster supplied the white walkers with his sons to propitiate them and maybe even bring about the return of the old ways.
Mormont and Craster represent the first humans on either side of the wall. And now they lay dead side by side, killed by treachery. Bad signs for all of humanity no matter where you are.
3648	TheButcherCrow	2013-04-22	While I am grateful for Ned Stark of Winterfell for sparing the life of my son Jorah, let my last wish be known that I ask the King (of the North) to lift his exile and let him return home. Sorry to hack up your quote but this is pretty important when it comes to discussing/evaluating the character of Jorah Mormont. He was not exiled by Ned Stark, he ran. If he hadn't legged it to Essos before Ned arrived on Bear Island trust me, Ice would have had his head.
3649	Winterz	2013-04-22	I loved that there was still NW who fought for Mormont after he's gone. Guess at least some of them took their vows and loyalty seriously /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />

3652	BorhPT	2013-04-22	the dude who started everything is Chett i think (Burn Gorman). I like Rast, he's a bad guy with the brains and skills of a peasant. An underdog that will be crowned King of Westeros by the end of book 7
3653	Mark Antony	2013-04-22	My favourite part of the scene was Grenn running to attack Burn Gorman moments after Rast stabs Mormont. I've always like Grenn, but I've never truly loved him until right now.Yes Grenn is awesome, Love him in the Books and he is perfect on the show.
3654	Frey Pie a la Mode	2013-04-22	So we don't get to see the raven eat Lord Commander Mormont's eyeball? That's actually okay by me...
3655	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	'I AM A GODLY MAN!''
''You are a bastard, a daughter fucking wildling bastard''
''RUN FAST PIGGY! AND SLEEP WELL! I'LL BE CUTTING YOUR THROAT ONE OF THESE NIGHTS''
some great dialogue and an ultimately good adaption of The Mutiny of the Night's Watch, however I'm also disappointed we didn't get Jeor's dying words.
3656	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-22	Felt a bit guilty over thinking random ranger guy was a total hottie. 
Also GREEN RUNNING TO ATTACK THE BADDY. YES. I love Grenn and Edd and Pyp
Jon's  Bros

3657	Spring Snow	2013-04-22	Felt a bit guilty over thinking random ranger guy was a total hottie.Hah! Same here. Apparently Burn Gorman is a big deal? I had no idea, but I thought he was pretty cute up until he commenced with the shankin'. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />The whole scene leading up to that was wonderful. For being a tubby old man, Craster really evoked that 'wild, tough old salt that you don't want to mess with kind' of image when he was sputtering with rage, banging on his chest, and bellowing out "I AM A GODLY MAN!"
3658	go joff go	2013-04-22	I don't remember the book but I think it would have seemed kind of weird if Mormont said something about his son joining the NW  to Sam.  There is just no reason to think Sam would ever meet Jorah.
3659	PetyrPunkinhead	2013-04-22	Rast seemed like the right guy to be part of all this.  The scene played out really well.  I'm only sorry we didn't get Mormont's final words to Sam.Gah! I know! It frustrated me how they could get so much of that scene right w/ the chaos and anger of the watch from starvation, but leave out such an important character moment for Mormont. For a split second thought the Old Bear would stumble outside and have his moment w/ Sam, but then he coughed up the blood and that greasy fucker started stabbing him.
3660	ShigellaSand	2013-04-23	Owen Harper Yeah, just some random Night's Watch guy with attitude.  We saw him last week too mouthing off.Clearly destined to die and walk again...
3661	A Real Dire Wolf	2013-04-23	I thought the Old Bear would at least bring Rast down with him, but no. That was frustrating.
3662	go joff go	2013-04-23	By the way have we ruled out the old bear coming back as a wight at some point??
3663	Sun	2013-04-23	I wonder what plans the show has for Burn Gorman's character? You don't hire an actor of his calibre just to kill him off after a couple of episodes.
3664	King Tommen	2013-04-23	You don't have Rast staying alive and yelling threateningly at Sam as he runs away without him reappearing later in the season (probably "wight"ed) to try and take Sam down for good.  I call him being shut down by Coldhands.  This is of course after Sam takes down Puddles the Other with the Dragonglass.
3665	JohnnyRoastBeef	2013-04-23	I hated Mormont getting killed by Craster getting shanked was kind of hilarious. Both in the show and books.
3666	Dove	2013-04-23	I wonder what plans the show has for Burn Gorman's character? You don't hire an actor of his calibre just to kill him off after a couple of episodes.It'd be really cool if he stuck around, maybe to be an antagonist to Jon later, but I could see him just being one of the mutineers killed by Coldhands.

Been dreading that scene all season.. no last words were disheartening, but I enjoyed the scene overall. Honestly, I can see them getting rid of the "Sam the Slayer" thing. I don't think it's that important to the overall story.

It's the first time the NW and later Stannis learns how to kill the white walkers. "Sam the Slayer," is pretty integral to the entire storyline concerning the NW, wildling's and the white walkers. Not to mention, it explains why they find dragon glass at the fist of the first men.

3669	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-23	Yeah they have to do Slayer. I hope at least Grenn and Edd are there somehow for it. I have a feeling the WW will try to grab Gilly's baby for whatever purpose they take baby sacrifices and Sam gets some random courage from trying to rescue Gilly.
3670	Winterz	2013-04-24	Or there was simply no one to stop them from butchering each other anymore.Their cause was the same. Why would they butcher each other if all they wanted to was to get some food (okay, some also wanted Craster's women). It was obvious that when Mormont died the most loyal to the NW attacked suddenly, especially since there were still a few veterans there. They sure as hell wouldn't support the killing of Mormont.
3671	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-24	It'd be really cool if he stuck around, maybe to be an antagonist to Jon later, but I could see him just being one of the mutineers killed by Coldhands.I read somewhere he was going to PLAY coldhands, but I dunno...
3672	Winterz	2013-04-24	I read somewhere he was going to PLAY coldhands, but I dunno...That theory was quickly refuted. The individual who proposed it must've found Gorman's character's name (which is named "Night's Watchman") and presumed it meant Coldhands. But since we already saw his role, I guess he may lead the rebels and no more than that. Since Coldhands first appears only in what..episode 7-8? It is likely that Gorman may still make a few appearances.

3674	Queen Regent	2013-04-24	Just rewatched it. Edd wasn't killed, he killed the man who grabbed him. I had to pause to make that clear. Dolorous Edd is very much alive thank R'hllor. /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' /> thank you for going back and looking for that! And I do hope that Sam kills and Other soon.  That's how he gained the respect from the rest of the NW brothers, right?

That's how he gained the respect from the rest of the NW brothers, right?I don't know how true that is.  Grenn was the only guy who saw it and the rest of the NW men who heard about it pretty much all got slaughtered at Craster's.  I don't think it's that necessary really. Gilly will at least be there to see it which is going to be the thing that gives him more confidence.
3676	Dove	2013-04-24	If Dolorous Edd had died it would've been so much worse than Ned. /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' />
I'm guessing that Sam the Slayer is going to happen when he's defending Gilly.
Unless they switch it up and have someone be with the two of them, like Grenn or something, it means that his story won't be particularly believable. Then again, even the last time I read the book I wasn't quite sure if the "Slayer" nickname was intended to be mocking by most of the brothers or if Sam just saw it that way because he's insecure as hell.
3677	Winterz	2013-04-24	Don't you mean... Samwell the Murderer?
Poor Puddles, never stood a chance against the very large (as in sideways) human.
3678	crazibouncer	2013-04-24	It looked like Edd stabbed the man behind him.  R.I.P. Jeor Mormont.  I was upset that him and Sam didn't have their moment together, but when he grabbed Rast and slammed him against the wall and started chocking him was BADASS.  I was just pissed that he collapsed before he was able to finish him off.  I also loved the guy who killed Craster, you could tell what was going on through his head before he called him bastard, "Fuck, what am I doing...*prepares* ok let's do this"
3679	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-24	I think Burn Gorman's character will become a wight, like Rast, and attack Sam before Coldhands arrives.
3680	Versiroth	2013-04-25	So since the Old Bear didn't get to be held by Sam the slayer for a long time while he died and didn't impart on him his dying wish of having his son Jorah join the Nights Watch.Does that mean(confirm) Sam will never get to tell Jorah and he'll never join the NW?I don't believe that he ever will in the books either.   Do you honestly think he'll ever truly leave Danny?   I think that part in the book was only to show that Mormont was thinking about his son at the end.
3681	Head of The Ned	2013-04-26	I keep re-watching this scene. Everything about it is so perfect.
Craster: I am a Godly Man!
Rast: You're a stingy bastard!
Everything that Burn Gorman did was on point. Awesome actor I hope he sticks around, if anything I would say Rast/Craster/Mormont will come back as a wight
The guy who played Craster was perfect too, I loved how there was some audible pig snorting sounds during the scene when Craster was talking to Jeor, emphasizes his "wildlingness" even more.

3682	Gran de Lys	2013-04-26	Chett is the ringleader of the NW rebellion that kicks off aSoS, right? Just before the WWs show up and he pisses his pants. I like that they scrapped that scene and the idea of a little band of no-goods who hated Jon, and shifted it to a general restlessness and anger among the NW, with smug Craster as its chief target. Great scene, but so dark on my crummy TV I have watched it 3 times and still not sure who does what when. Except I know Dolorous Edd survives, because complaining about his bad luck his his shtick--he never seems to actually have any bad luck.
3683	Jamie Lannister	2013-04-22	So does this episode put to bed any notions that "Boy" ISN'T Ramsay? Let's take a little look.Psychotic smirk: Check.Total betrayal of Theon: Check.Blatant sadistic tendencies: Check.Learning that the Stark boys are still alive (which Ramsay already knew in the books; this was a different way for him to get the same knowledge): Check.Ordering around the other torturers ("Put him back where he belongs!"): Check.Surely this proves it beyond a shadow of reasonable doubt. Tonight we met the real Ramsay Sn-- uh, Bolton. And he is terrifyingly glorious.
3684	Jamie Lannister	2013-04-22	One thing I dislike is how defensive he got when framing Theon though. "I've brought him back. He- he killed the others!" doesn't sound very Ramsay-esque. Book!Ramsay (when he drops the mask, which TV-wise was right now) is commanding and sure of himself to the point of shameless arrogance.

Book!Ramsay (when he drops the mask, which TV-wise was right now) is commanding and sure of himself to the point of shameless arrogance.I also thought it was a bit strange, but I think it was just an idea he maybe just came up with (to tell them that) ... I mean, I guess he COULD be a little defensive about killing his (or rather his father's) own men ... at least at this point. He hasn't been legitimized yet.

We know his characterization and how twisted he is after reading ADWD, but he hasn't revealed himself as Ramsay yet in the show. Give it time.
3689	TheEvilKing	2013-04-22	So does this episode put to bed any notions that "Boy" ISN'T Ramsay? Let's take a little look.I didn't think that was even in doubt...
3690	Lady Sansa Stark	2013-04-22	Did anyone thought it wasn't Ramsay, then? Besides, the guy from last episode also called him ''bastard'', I think that was a nice reference. I look forward to his scenes, Ramsay is well played by the actor.
3691	Sun	2013-04-22	He is Ramsay, I have no doubt, but I do have a niggling question about the scene. When he first brought Theon into the room, he said "I brought him back, he killed the others" almost in the tone of an underling. He didn't sound like a commander/leader in that room. He sounded like he needed to excuse his actions and the absence of the other men, it's almost as if no one expected to be the one that brings Theon back. Even when he told the men to put him back where he belongs, the tone he used wasn't authoritative. Frankly I'm a bit puzzled by it.Is Ramsay not commanding the Bolton troops? He should be, Roose said he was. Do the men not look on him as their leader because he's a bastard? Is this Theon exercise not only to break Theon, but to bend his father's men to his command by eliminating the leaders among them?I'm not sure, I'm just puzzled by his demeanor in that room.ETA:I see Jamie Lannister already brought up the point:One thing I dislike is how defensive he got when framing Theon though. "I've brought him back. He- he killed the others!" doesn't sound very Ramsay-esque. Book!Ramsay (when he drops the mask, which TV-wise was right now) is commanding and sure of himself to the point of shameless arrogance.I can only think that his tone indicated he's not in true command of his men because of his status as a bastard. They don't respect him.

We know that Ramsay was ordered to retake Winterfell on behalf of his father, which definitely implies some degree of leadership and authority; why is he acting subservient to anyone but Roose? Ramsay threw his weight around all the time in the books. Friends and foes alike are scared of his temper.Well, maybe it is because he's still a Snow, but still.
3693	Roose Seal	2013-04-22	OR he could be putting on an act for the troops as well.
I've had this thought:
Maybe in the next episode we see "Ramsay" (who is actually the real Ramsay's servant Reek) commanding troops around. The troops believe him to be the real Ramsay Snow when he is actually just some servant the real Ramsay has cleaned up and put in nice clothing.
In a later episode, "Boy" (who is actually Ramsay) kills "Ramsay" and reveals himself to be the true Bastard of Bolton and makes Theon into his new Reek.
Complete mindfuck for everyone and it sort of follows the book's Reek/Ramsay reveal.
As of now, the "Boy" character is a little confusing to book readers because we keep trying to compare this story with the book's when they've already made significant changes. To show-viewers, he is just a servant boy who tricked Theon, they have no idea he's supposed to be the bastard of bolton yet. Let's wait and see how it plays out.

3694	vectner	2013-04-22	I felt that Ramsay was acting as if this wasn't his idea, so Theon doesn't catch on. My non book reader wife is all confused. She knows it's a mind game, but she doesn't know that "boy" is running the show. I half expected the men to "capture" Ramsay as well, so him and Theon could have some more bonding time as prisoners.

Book!Ramsay (when he drops the mask, which TV-wise was right now) is commanding and sure of himself to the point of shameless arrogance.Well, I imagine Roose wouldn't be very pleased if he learned that Ramsay killed his men just to amuse himself. I think Ramsay's in charge of the Dreadfort but he still fears his father.
3696	Delmas	2013-04-22	Well, I imagine Roose wouldn't be very pleased if he learned that Ramsay killed his men just to amuse himself. I think Ramsay's in charge of the Dreadfort but he still fears his father.Not to mention the men are likely to revolt if they know their leader killed many of their brothers/friends for a few laughs.Also he may not want Theon to know he is actually the one in charge
3697	freetickles	2013-04-22	Yeah, I don't think he's acting subservient, just trying to hide the fact he killed his father's men. Also, I think he's avoiding showing authority so he can keep up a bit of his ruse with Theon .... who may even still trust him despite being betrayed since he has no other options.
3698	Frey Pie a la Mode	2013-04-22	Yes, it's still all a part of the game (that Ramsey is playing with Theon, and the writers are playing with the non-book readers).

To show-viewers, he is just a servant boy who tricked Theon, they have no idea he's supposed to be the bastard of bolton yet. Let's wait and see how it plays out.I don't think that will work too well on TV though. People are confused enough as it is and that is the whole point. Get people out of the zone and unsettled for when the true nature of Ramsay is revealed. There is no need to make them more confused or they dis-invest themselves from the story - especially as they are all currently cheering for Dany.
3700	King Tommen	2013-04-22	He's been posing as a stable boy in front of the rest of the men, they are obviously all in on the ruse.  Book readers are so friggin impatient to see Ramsay that they aren't fully understanding what's going on in any of these scenes.
He's playing games with Theon (for his sick pleasure but also to get information) and he's got all of the men there on board with it.  I'm sure they wouldn't be as much on board with Ramsay's plan if they knew he was going to be killing them for his own amusement as part of it so he probably threw in that comment to them about Theon being the one to kill the others so as not to implicate himself too much.  Meanwhile, the ruse is still going to continue with Ramsay not fully revealing himself to Theon as the ringleader and more importantly where he is and who he is.
All the talk about Yara and the Iron Islands is deliberately there to confuse the issue for both Theon but mainly the audience.  When it comes time to show Theon that he's at the Dreadfort and the boy is Roose's bastard who came to liberate Winterfell, the plot will click into place.  But as soon as you do this, you alert the audience that Roose is a full-blown villain since he's the one who vouched for this obvious psychopath in the first place with Robb.  So you need to delay all of this information until very close to the RW so that the Roose betrayal isn't telegraphed so blatantly.
I understand the confusion from the non-reader end (because it's by design and the lack of information is intended to confuse) but book-readers should have been on to this a lot more quickly, I'm surprised threads pop up like this so often.
3701	Tywin's bastard	2013-04-22	Yeah, this bothered me. We know that Ramsay was ordered to retake Winterfell on behalf of his father, which definitely implies some degree of leadership and authority; why is he acting subservient to anyone but Roose? Ramsay threw his weight around all the time in the books. Friends and foes alike are scared of his temper.Well, maybe it is because he's still a Snow, but still.He does tell them "put him back where he belongs" too though.
3702	Flayed Starkman	2013-04-22	I just wish they would reveal him as Ramsay already.
Although I think it would be better if they introduced the original Reek, before starting Theon's transformation. I had hoped that the original torturer was Reek, but no such luck.
3703	Prince of the North	2013-04-22	Yeah, I just thought it was Ramsey continuing to play mind games with Theon.  Theon now knows "Boy" betrayed him but he still doesn't know "Boy" is Ramsey and is actually calling all the shots.  If Theon continues to think "Boy" is also just doing things out of fear, etc. then maybe he'll still tell him things (e.g. Bran and Rickon are alive, etc.)?
3704	Nezzer	2013-04-22	I thought he said that Theon killed the others so that his own men wouldn't know that they are THAT expendable to Ramsay. I doubt the Bastard's Boys would be loyal to him if they learned Ramsay would kill them all without a second thought just for some sick mind game.

3705	Warrior Queen	2013-04-22	One thing did surprise me. Ramsay was telling this story about 'I saw you getting on the boat to leave to Winterfell' and 'Balon's last son' bla bla. And still Theon never asks what his name is. I mean, if someone saved me from constant torture i would want to know what his name is. Ramsay could just introduce himself as Reek and get book readers excited.
[Though it might be that people start to google Reek and read the entire thing on the wiki]
Besides that, awsome scene. I loooooved the look on Ramsay's face when the put Theon back on the Bolton Cross.

3706	Neeps on a Breastplate	2013-04-22	I wouldn't be surprised if Boy goes back to playing innocent once the other men leave the room, claiming that something must have happened to Yara and that he had to act like he recaptured Theon on purpose.Not because it's believable, mind you, but because he wants to see how many times he can jerk Theon around before the big reveal. Theon is obviously desperate for a friend and confidante - it's his Big Character Flaw - and Ramsey is just the sort of person to mine the depths of that sort of weakness like it's treasure.
3707	Grandpa House	2013-04-23	As far as the "He killed the others" line goes, I actually think the true "reveal" came to fruition right after that line, when he actually steps in front of the torture rack and says "Put him back where he belongs". This was probably so the viewer (and Theon) could have time to fully grasp the 2-part twist: 1. that the servant boy had betrayed Theon, and 2. that he was actually the leader

3711	victim	2013-04-24	This because of Tywin's conversation with Arya last season? What's the significance?I never said it was significant, it's just a nice little nod. Lowborn people say "Mi'Lord," if Boy was born on Saltcliff, he wouldn't have called Theon "My Lord." Just another hint that Boy wasn't who he claimed he was.

edit: Shouldn't Ramsay be a little rough around the edges himself though? He was probably brought to the Dreadfort a few years before the War began. Then again, it's all about posture and position for Ramsay so he'd be quick to latch onto speaking like a Lord's son.

3713	Dove	2013-04-24	That's true, he's been a miller's son and peasant up until right before the start of the series. He also knows how to read and write already, apparently, since he's been communicating with Roose that way. I guess he'd go out of his way to learn that stuff as soon as Roose took him in, though, like "Aww yeah I'm owed this."
You have to feel for the poor maester that was probably Ramsay's tutor. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />
That conversation between Arya and Tywin about "m'lord"/"my lord" is a pretty good one, I'm glad they moved it to being closer to the beginning of the series so you can notice little things in the dialogue like that.
3714	Iotun	2013-04-24	I think you can justify it as partly:
a) he doesn't want anybody telling his father that he is killing his men
/cool.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='B)' /> he isn't sure about their loyalties yet, and isn't about to let the rest of the dreadfort men know he's willing to kill them for his own amusement
c) he probably feels the torturers will be crueler to Theon if they feel he killed their fellows
3715	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-24	I think the reading thing comes down to Ramsay being super eager to be a Lord, not a peasant. We see this when he scolds Theon for eating the rats at the dreadfort because they belong to his ''Lord father'' and also when he despises being called Bastard.
3716	Sun	2013-04-24	I think you can justify it as partly:a) he doesn't want anybody telling his father that he is killing his men /cool.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='B)' /> he isn't sure about their loyalties yet, and isn't about to let the rest of the dreadfort men know he's willing to kill them for his own amusementc) he probably feels the torturers will be crueler to Theon if they feel he killed their fellowsThe point that niggles is not what he said, but the tone in which he said. He didn't have the authority of a commander in his voice. He sounded like an underling in that room. It could just have been a choice made by the actor for a a psych reason yet unclear to us.
3717	Inquisitor Glokta	2013-04-24	So does this episode put to bed any notions that "Boy" ISN'T Ramsay? Let's take a little look.Psychotic smirk: Check.Total betrayal of Theon: Check.Blatant sadistic tendencies: Check.Learning that the Stark boys are still alive (which Ramsay already knew in the books; this was a different way for him to get the same knowledge): Check.Ordering around the other torturers ("Put him back where he belongs!"): Check.Surely this proves it beyond a shadow of reasonable doubt. Tonight we met the real Ramsay Sn-- uh, Bolton. And he is terrifyingly glorious.Being put on imdb as 'Ramsay Snow': Check.

3718	Prince of Dragonstone	2013-04-24	As sick and sad as Theon and Ramsay's story arc is in the book series, I also find it one of the most fascinating aspects of ASoIaF and it manages to raise this sword and sorcery tale to another level. I can't wait to see how the TV series handles this and how it unfolds. I also think The Boy is being played amazingly well by Iwan Rheon.
3719	Prince of Dragonstone	2013-04-24	We never saw the psychological horrors that Theon went through. We have to assume that it was much more than just pure physical torture that turned the proud and haughty Theon Greyjoy into the sniveling, pathetic Reek. Ramsay must have mind-f*cked Theon three ways from Sunday and the beginning of this psycho-torture is what we're seeing now. I wonder how the casual TV audience is going to take this storyline. I wonder if they'll be turned off by the cruelty or appreciate it as a part of Theon's eventual redemption arc. I know one thing is for sure...the show can't just show scenes of Theon getting tortured every episode because that would be too much.
3720	shiola	2013-04-24	Yeah, I just thought it was Ramsey continuing to play mind games with Theon.  Theon now knows "Boy" betrayed him but he still doesn't know "Boy" is Ramsey and is actually calling all the shots.  If Theon continues to think "Boy" is also just doing things out of fear, etc. then maybe he'll still tell him things (e.g. Bran and Rickon are alive, etc.)?He already told him Bran and Rickon are alive
3721	Prince of the North	2013-04-24	He already told him Bran and Rickon are aliveRight.  That's why the "e.g." is there - as in "for example".
3722	shiola	2013-04-24	An awesome little thing I'd like to add, the entire time he calls Theon "My Lord," instead of "mi'lord."Ahh, I didn't notice that.

I don't know if that's intentional because of your username buuuut jeeze.
3723	shiola	2013-04-24	Right.  That's why the "e.g." is there - as in "for example".Ohh, derp.  I always forget the difference between "e.g." and "etc".  Oops.  Sorry!
3724	Prince of the North	2013-04-24	Ohh, derp.  I always forget the difference between "e.g." and "etc".  Oops.  Sorry!No big deal.  I sometimes confuse "i.e." (that is) with "e.g." (for example) myself.  The abbreviation "e.g." is for the Latin phrase "exempli gratia" and basically means "for example" while the abbreviation "i.e." is for the Latin phrase "id est" which basically translates to "that is".What I was getting at above is that Ramsey will still play his game with Theon awhile longer and as long as Theon thinks he is just "Boy" he may confide more things which Ramsey can then use against him.  It's not enough for Ramsey to just torture and break someone physically.  No, it seems he wants to do it psychologically as well - his control of his victims must be total /stillsick.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':stillsick:' />
3725	Tone	2013-04-24	An awesome little thing I'd like to add, the entire time he calls Theon "My Lord," instead of "mi'lord."Glad I wasn't the only one to notice that. Wonder how many people picked up on that and remembered the Tywin/Arya discussion about the difference between the two last season.EDIT: Also kudos to the actor playing Ramsay. That look on his face once he lit the torch and the X was revealed....

3728	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-24	Eeee, I love Iwan Rheon in this. His slasher smile was awesome. He and Alfie Allen got along well--Alfie said in an interview the cross was really uncomfortable to be on, so Iwan kept him company between takes.
I took the "I brought him back" line as Ramsay still being kind of "in character." He's able to deliver a crushing betrayal but also keep it under wraps Theon's not being tortured by the Ironborn (as Theon has been led to believe). Plus, I doubt he wants everyone in the Dreadfort to know he'll kill them all for giggles.
Also, Theon was starting to scream and thrash so he might not have even heard "put him back where he belongs."

3730	Head of The Ned	2013-04-24	Some of you people are reading into this too much...
He is Ramsay. He is in control at the Dreadfort. He would never admit to killing his own men so he blames it on Theon. It's really that simple.

What armor are the men wearing that were torturing Theon and that Ramsay killed?  Ironborn, right?  And wasn't there a Bolton sigil somewhere?  On that rack where Theon is?Yep, they were deliberately wearing Ironborn armor to screw with Theon, that or the costume department re-used the Ironborn armor for the Dreadfort men...(highly unlikely)
3733	Dove	2013-04-24	I figured the Bolton men just killed the Ironborn and took their stuff when they went to surrender, simple as that. The armor/clothing would be useful for messing with Theon and if Ramsay's going to torch Winterfell he needs someone to pin it on and no witnesses running around.
I guess that means Dagmer Un-Cleftjaw is dead in the show, then? Not that it makes any difference, I don't remember him doing anything after this point in the books.
3734	Nezzer	2013-04-24	This.Yep, they were deliberately wearing Ironborn armor to screw with Theon, that or the costume department re-used the Ironborn armor for the Dreadfort men...(highly unlikely)They were wearing it deliberately. Last episode Theon told Ramsay that the men torturing him said that Balon knew Theon was being tortured, so they were actually trying to plant the idea on his head that it was the Ironborn who were him tortured.
3735	Montey14	2013-04-24	Did anyone thought it wasn't Ramsay, then? Besides, the guy from last episode also called him ''bastard'', I think that was a nice reference. I look forward to his scenes, Ramsay is well played by the actor.that last guy was the original Reek....Inthe book he was pumped full of arrows by sir Rodricks men thinking it was ramsey....here ramsey himself makes him into swiss cheese.....I do think he's a little too pretty to be Ramsey though....I pictured a harder face...but the actor is good and thats what counts...
3736	PetyrPunkinhead	2013-04-24	Some of you people are reading into this too much...He is Ramsay. He is in control at the Dreadfort. He would never admit to killing his own men so he blames it on Theon. It's really that simple.My thoughts exactly.Also, Ramsay's men have to be in on Ramsay's ruse. Ramsay likely wants Theon to keep thinking he's an underling and not the guy in charge just to fuck with Theon's head. Ya know, b/c he's Ramsay Snow/Bolton and that's the kind of fucked up thing he enjoys.
3737	Bolton's Bastard	2013-04-24	They were wearing it deliberately. Last episode Theon told Ramsay that the men torturing him said that Balon knew Theon was being tortured, so they were actually trying to plant the idea on his head that it was the Ironborn who were him tortured.Yeah, my latter example is what some people must be assuming but it's totally retarded. Obviously they're wearing it deliberately. I hope we see some flayed Ironborn in the dungeon around Theon before the season ends.

I hope we see some flayed Ironborn in the dungeon around Theon before the season ends.I really want to see some flayed bodies (or just skins) hanging in the dungeons. I'd love to see Ramsay showing Theon what he did to Dagmer and the other ~19 ironmen. They are probably going to do something like that. I doubt Theon will spend the next 3 episodes he's supposed to appear in (they said Theon is appearing in 6 episodes this season) tied to the Bolton cross.Oh, and I would like to correct this: "[..]that it was the Ironborn who were him tortured". I meant "who had him tortured". I know you understood what I meant, I just hate leaving mistakes behind like that /happy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='^_^' />
3739	Jazzman	2013-04-25	Goosebumps all over body when he made his face and said "put him back where he belong"
3740	lannistergold	2013-04-25	I think that this superficially polite, pretending-to-care Ramsay has been an improvement on the character. That's how psychopaths often are, and a big part of what makes them so dangerous. They're also compulsive liars, so "he killed the others" is just par for the course.
3741	callmedodge	2013-04-25	Everything Boy has done so far is perfectly in line with what I imagined Ramsay`s character to be like. Theon didn`t become Reek just through countless hours of torture. He needs to feel that he cannot live without Ramsay. 
This is only the beginning of Ramsay getting inside Theon`s head. I`m certain that his final "Put him back where he belongs." was just a confirmation for the viewer that this guy is not to be  trusted but that Theon never heard it - too busy screaming. 
He`ll still trust Boy because that`s what Boy needs to play his game.
3742	Miodrag	2013-04-25	Do they have to keep trying so hard to shock the viewers all the time? And do they have to create stupid subplots along the way?
Just ask yourself about Boyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s logic on this one. He frees Theon, then murders those who try to catch Theon, then takes Theon back (with Theon not realizing theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re once again in the same castle he escaped from?!), and then guides the poor lad to the tunnel that leads to the torture room... What was he trying to gain at this point, before Theon opened his soul to him? What was Boyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s plan? I mean, did he expect of Theon to share all the personal secrets in front of that gate, right before they enter the room in which Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to find the terrible truth?
Or, was The Boy just lucky beyond expectations? And if so, what were his intentions in the first place? Pure manipulation for the sake of manipulation? Really?!
Granted, there might be an explanation waiting for us in the next episode. But, so far, it looks like one of those things they do all the time: too much trouble over disappointingly small reward. Like Jon/Craster â<U+0080><U+009C>cliffhangerâ<U+0080><U+009D> from episode 2 last season, or the stealing of dragons, or some other subplot in which everything was contrived for the purpose of shocking the viewers, but other than that lead absolutely nowhere.
And one more thing: weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re four episodes in, and theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re still playing the mystery-card in Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s story. Viewers still donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know who are Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s captures. So, what was the point of the last Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scene in Season 2? If they only showed Bran and company coming out of the crypts, and skipped the entire Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s speech â<U+0080><U+0093> which was a pretty ridiculous scene in its own right and, of course, a cost in time and money â<U+0080><U+0093> the audience wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be any worse off than it is right now.

He wants to be entertained. He enjoys other people breaking because of his actions. A trait that Roose considers a flaw as it makes him a loudmouth. And yes, Ramsay got more candy in this christmas present he made for himself than a kid owning a candy store. As far as the TV shows, Bran and Rickon are dead for all the Northeners, except the Dreadfort men (Ramsay) who took Theon's confession as an unwanted bucket of sugar. Remeber they still have to tie-in the story where Roose decides what to do with Jaime Lannister and his role in the war which is pretty obvious what is he going to do.

Really?!Thought it was fairly obvious to anyone who's read the books, it's all about psychological torture in addition to physical with Ramsay. He is giving Theon hope while simultaneously breaking him down. Making him believe the Ironborn are torturing him and that his father is aware of it but doing nothing about it. Basically allowing it to happen. But then hope comes in the form of his sister deeply caring enough to send someone in undercover to get him out.Then he helps him escape, can you imagine if you were being tortured and someone set you free what that must feel like? The relief. Only to be brought right back by the person you thought was on your side? Then everything comes crashing back down. Your sister isn't trying to save you and you are back to being tortured by your father's men.

If they only showed Bran and company coming out of the crypts, and skipped the entire Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s speech â<U+0080><U+0093> which was a pretty ridiculous scene in its own right and, of course, a cost in time and money â<U+0080><U+0093> the audience wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be any worse off than it is right now.As someone pointed out, if they revealed who Boy is at this point it would tip people off that Roose isn't to be trusted and the RW. Granted they could still reveal Ramsay and have some sort of dialog between two Dreadfort randoms about how pissed Roose is going to be to find out what Ramsay has been doing, so people think Roose is still loyal or whatnot.
3746	Miodrag	2013-04-25	I don't want to repeat myself too much but (from earlier in the thread):The main point of my post wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t Boy's attempt to shock Theon, but writers attempt to shock the audience by Boy whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s trying to shock Theon. You see, I wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t talking about the way Boy addressed his men in the torture room. Nor am I impatient to see any particular character: Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m only impatient, desperate even, to see someone behaving logically in this subplot.The logic of Boyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s actions so far, doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t depend on what you and I and all the readers are expecting to happen. If Boy is indeed who we think he is, and if his identity is revealed late enough for some other surprises to come unspoiled, it still doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t change all the plot-holes we witnessed in the last two episodes. Or, more precisely, not plot-holes, but stupid and lame subplots. If Boy wanted to gain confidential information from Theon â<U+0080><U+0093> which is, by the way, quite an assumption, since why would he even think thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s something crucial that Theon would only reveal to a helping soul, and not under extreme pain?! â<U+0080><U+0093> than why was he leading Theon back to the torture chamber? If Theon, say, told him about Bran and Rickon while they were riding through the woods, it wouldâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been much better. Than it wouldâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been understandable why Boy decided to lead Theon back to the castle: he found out something big, now letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s go back to the torture, right? But no, he guides Theon back to the castle for the sole purpose of â<U+0080><U+0093> bringing him back to the castle! The way it was filmed, Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reveal could in no way influence Boyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s decision to take him back to torture. We just have a psychopath who gained all-important information by pure fluke, in the last possible moment.If you consider stupidity in movies and other shows, it is hardly a big deal. We see things like that all the time. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m just disappointed twists like this find their way in the show based on the novels that contain not a single nonsense of this kind.

They donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want us to know who Boy is; fine, I guess. But, in that regard, Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s speech scene was not just unnecessary, but also counterproductive. If they wanted to play the mystery card for so long, then the mystery wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be any easier to solve without the Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s speech scene. It is an issue with the previous season and not the current one, but thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m saying.
3748	Miodrag	2013-04-25	Ramsay is not about what intell or info he can get. He does things because he wants to. He wants to be entertained. He enjoys other people breaking because of his actions. A trait that Roose considers a flaw as it makes him a loudmouth. And yes, Ramsay got more candy in this christmas present he made for himself than a kid owning a candy store. As far as the TV shows, Bran and Rickon are dead for all the Northeners, except the Dreadfort men (Ramsay) who took Theon's confession as an unwanted bucket of sugar. Remeber they still have to tie-in the story where Roose decides what to do with Jaime Lannister and his role in the war which is pretty obvious what is he going to do.Is it wrong to expect no such â<U+0080><U+009C>candyâ<U+0080><U+009D> in the show? Because, let's say, candies like that aren't exactly the signs of a great writing. And they are especially jarring in the story of Theon Greyjoy, which is, for me at least, one of the most amazing and awe-commanding achievements in ASOIAF!

3749	BananaSpice	2013-04-25	I think the story feels awkward and is suffering in their attempt to confuse the viewers (or titillate the book readers) ... I'm guessing that Ramsay just wanted to fuck with Theon while trying to get inside his head (which ended up paying off). Theon tells him a lot of personal things that he can now use against him. No, he didn't know that would work or if Theon would tell him anything, but it was worth it to give him a taste of freedom and then snatch it away. The LOOK he gives Theon when he realizes he's fucked sums it up.
There's also the possibility that he intended to just hunt Theon down w/ his men, but then got pissed at those men when they were going to rape him? Or it was part of his original plan to kill them? We just don't know ... maybe he'll explain later.

But, it does look like a mess at this point (especially if we compare it with the book version of Ramsay, which is nothing short of a twisted excellence), and in previous instances HBO never did manage to climb out of the whole they dig on a satisfying note. One can hope, however.

I'm enjoying getting to watch some of my favorite moments, at least.
3753	insertname	2013-04-25	I seriously don't understand the problem with the Ramsay Storyline. It's usually one of the higher points of any episode.
At least to book readers, Ramsay's motivation should be obvious (He wants to give Theon hope to further break him). I can't see any plot holes or the like. Plus both of the actors are superb. Simon looks nice, which makes the payoff of seeing his twisted face even bigger.
The mystery may be dragging a bit long, but again that shouldn't be a problem for bookreaders, just for those who watch the show only.
edit: And I'm kinda tired of people claiming this was not in the books. Okay, yes the details play out quite differently, but the core story (Ramsay letting Theon "escape") is the same. It's been a bit since I've last read ADWD so I'm not quite sure if Ramsay himself appeared to help Theon (I don't think so?) but even then, I think it works out even better and more twisted.

3754	shiola	2013-04-25	Take a deep breath.I'm sorry you perceive it that way, the only thing I intended to come off rudely was the first quote, which was in response to an abrasive post. The rest is just me being sarcastic/joking around. I do it with a smile.Sorry man.  Sometimes I forget that the internet isn't serious  business.  I'm sarcastic in every day life and sometimes it's hard to relate it into text, so I get you.
3755	Dove	2013-04-25	I think it's a high point for some of us because we already know what's going on - but I can understand the complaints, and see how this storyline would be dragging in the eyes of a show watcher. In their view, we've gotten no real answers or clues for three episodes and now the story's gone in a complete circle. It's hard to be invested in a mystery when you have no idea how it's relevant to the greater picture.There's just too much conflicting information to get a clearer picture without book knowledge unless you're one of those dorks that analyzes every single frame of the show. X like a Bolton sigil. Northmen outside the gates. Ironborn clothing/armor. Luwin mentioned "secret tunnels out of Winterfell" last season. etc.With Theon only appearing in three more episodes this season, this story is about to taper off and probably only re-appear when it's relevant to provide some answers. I assume part of why they haven't revealed Ramsay is to make the Boltons look less suspicious, but I think they still could have done that without necessarily implicating Roose - instead of "whodunnit?" the big question would've been "Whoa is this crazy asshole working alone and tricking his dad/Robb too or what?"Waffling aside I've liked it so far, but I'm glad it's going to take a back-seat for an episode or two especially when Jon and the wildlings in particular have been needing some screentime badly.

I have been SO BORED with Jon so far this season, and I think his parts were my favorites in ASOS. I felt super invested in Jon and Ygritte in the book, and it's just kind of meh in the show so far. I'm glad Theon is in the show and I'm really invested in that story since he's one of my favorite characters, but I mean ... could we cut out the "Podrick's super dick plot" or something?
3757	PhoenixFlame	2013-04-25	I love the scenes in the Theon arc, but I do think they could find a more graceful way to clear up the mystery without ruining Bolton's treachery--or even Theon knowing about it. Guards can make idle comments, or Roose can read a letter that was obviously from Ramsay and make it seem like he doesn't know how badly Theon is being treated or he is too busy/indifferent to do anything about it. In the book Robb and Cat know Bolton has captured Theon so he doesn't need to hide that nugget. 
Regarding the Rickon/Bran confession -- the Boltons probably just assumed they were dead and weren't trying to get that out of him. It strikes me as forced hope that Robb tries to suggest they escaped. When Theon reveals it, it's useful info, but it wasn't what they were after.

I don't think he'll be in the next episode at all, maybe not even the 6th.  That was a perfect point to go dark on that story and take the focus over to the other storylines.  I can kind of see them going back to it at the point one of the characters receives a piece of Theon's skin in a letter and then transitioning back to him having his finger been flayed and screaming "CUT IT OFF" and that scene going from there.

3759	RottenAppleFossoway	2013-04-25	Not a doubt in my mind that he's Ramsey Snow.
He should have plenty of time to assert himself as the both in charge and the most sadistic, unstable bat-shit crazy bastard in Westeros over the coming weeks and even into next season.
The look he gave at the end of the scene was perfect. He was gleefully happy to see Theon back on the rack. 
 Now we need to see a Roose leech scene and some flaying of Theon and we'll be all set going forward with the lovely House Bolton

3765	Lany Cassandra	2013-04-23	There was a discussion in the ratings thread about why people were rating the show so high and some were rating it so low so I thought the conversation should be separate from the discussion of the actual show.I know some people rate the show to how it compares to the books, some people on the acting, action, ect.For me this is a TV Show, and I rate it compared to TV, not huge multi-million dollar movies and I do my best to keep it separate from the books (canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t say I always succeed, but a non-book reading husband does help with that).  In general, I rate based on the enjoyment I get out of, the acting and the plot.From the commercials I have seen, shows like Honey Boo-Boo and Duck Dynasty would get 1s from me (not that I would waste that much time on them)I love my cop and lawyer shows, but they are in the 7-8 range.The husband likes Pawn Stars and I do like the home improvement shows, but they wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be more than 4-5I also enjoy some seriously cheesey shows like Arrow and Psych which are in the 6-7Game of Thrones rates 8-10 almost all the time for me.  I may have been upset with one episode (as compared to the books) and given one 7. (I did say it was hard to separate the two)Other shows that I find are in the 8+ range: Vikings and HomelandSo how do you determine the ratings you give Game of Thrones?  Do you base it on the books?  On tv? On the quality of the acting? On your emotional response to it? The enjoyment you get from it?
3766	shiola	2013-04-23	I have a friend and a brother who are not readers and watch the show with me so that definitely helps.  I just go with a gut instinct, really.  If there was more good than bad in the episode, it'll get an 8-9.  When this show is good, it's incredible, and when it's bad...  actually, fuck that, it's never bad.  It has some scenes that miss the mark for me, but that's about it.  I've never been disappointed  with more than one or two scenes per episode.
I dunno, I just find it hard to rate this show anything lower than an 8 when I think of how vast the universe comes across, and how much work has gone into creating it, and the immense talent of the actors.
3767	Alboin	2013-04-23	I have a very easy system. Each episode contains about 15 scenes of a different length and quality. Longer ones counts as a 1. lesser as 0.5 If I liked a scene I count it, if I didn't like it - I don't. Some very powerfull, breathtaking scenes (like the latest Dany's one) I count as 1.5 or even 2., but that's very rare.
3768	Table8	2013-04-23	It's impossible to achieve a consensus on criteria for rating.  To each his own.  Some people will deduct points if the show portrays events unlike the books.  Some simply go with gut feeling.  Some director wannabes will take into account the actual production elements, like cinematography and editing.
The only thing I wish is that people would stop giving out 10s like candy.  If every good episode is a 10, how can you differentiate a good episode from a truly great episode?  10s should be reserved for epic television.

3770	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-23	I tend to follow my gut feeling (which considers everything from acting to what happened to action) for the most part, and then think of the different scenes - if there's bothersome scenes they usually take the score down. I do try to only compare the episodes to other episodes of the series and not something completely different because there'd be no point in for example comparing Game of Thrones to my little ponies (which I don't watch).

3771	Iotun	2013-04-23	Gut instinct. I really don't have a system. If the episode entertained me (and I'm entertained if there's some forward momentum, or moments of emotional impact, generally something important happening rather than staying static in one place), and if there weren't any glaring mistakes or things I thought could be better, I'll give it a 10. I then subtract from 10 based on gut feeling based on things that could have worked better.
I tend to give 8-10s. I don't know, maybe I gave a 7, I can't easily remember, in Season 2, but I'm easily pleased, especially because I love the show. In contrast, I find some other shows very difficult to grab my attention and follow.
3772	Iotun	2013-04-23	By the way, why don't you move this thread to General Discussion, I think it would fit there better as it would be relevant throughout the Season.
3773	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-23	Gut feeling. 10 being perfect, 9 being excellent, 8 being really good, 7 being pretty good. I don't think I've ever given an episode less than 7 since the sheer talent of the actors and production value overall is just so good, tied in with the overall excellent source material, I don't ever find an episode not to be rated at least "Pretty good" by me. 
This isn't really compared to other TV Shows, books, movies, or anything like that. It's just a feeling of entertainment I get from watching it.
3774	Roose Seal	2013-04-23	For me it's a gut feeling.
If I find myself pausing the episode often, do other things while I watch, or generally not pay much attention to the episode, it's probably end up getting a 5 or something.
If the episodes manages to force me to stare at the screen for 45 minutes then it'll get a 9.
10 is when a great episode has that extra special scene that makes you go "oh shit", like, on top of my head: Ned denouncing Clegane in s1. The golden crown. Baelor. Daenerys getting her dragons. or Dracarys this season. S2 just had the wildfire explosion and that's about it.
So far the show hasn't had downright bad episodes. Some were boring and a little cheesy (last season's Dracarys was Xena-grade material) but it never had an episode that made me go "wtf did I just watch".
If I stop and think about the little things and compare stuff to the books, then yeah, maybe a couple episodes deserved a 9 so far, but I'm watching a TV show to be entertained so I try not to overthink it.

3775	Reposado	2013-04-23	I consider the episode based on how it works as an episode, and as part of the season
Source material doesn't factor at all and I tend to use most of the spectrum. 
Blackwater would have been a 9.5. The season 2 finale a 3. 
Recent 10s would include the train episode of breaking bad, the decoy episode of justified
3776	Sun	2013-04-23	My rating is based on how well the show delivers a cohesive hour of entertainment. Fealty to the books does not factor into my calculations, only the quality of the writing, the connections I make with the characters, the flow of the narrative, the pacing and ofcourse, the enjoymemnt it delivered in the hour. All these things combine to make one particular episode rate an 8, and another a 4.

3777	KoishNoish	2013-04-23	I judge the episode as an overall. I keep it separate from the books (and worry and think about the changes and similarities after). I judge the TV Show as a completely different thing from the books that doesn't need the books to continue. I rate it on the acting, the script, sometimes the set and the realism and belief of the characters. If I can believe that an actor IS their character then they've nailed that part very well. If I can believe it IS King's Landing then the set is perfect and so on. For example I think Charles Dance was the greatest choice ever for Tywin and I believe he is Tywin when he acts.
 When the episode ends I look it over and judge it on the progress made and the belief I had in the episode. Most are in 8/10 or above. This last one I'd give 9, I thought it nailed a lot of things that could've gone horribly wrong. I also have many friends who I've introduced to the TV series and have really gotten into it now after I showed them the first few episodes on DVD. I think the fact it draws people in so well and is able to maintain its audience with consistently excellent scenes should be applauded, especially due to its origins from the books. After I have reviewed the episode then I compare it to the books.
3778	Kasrith	2013-04-23	I do my best to keep it separate from the books (canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t say I always succeed, but a non-book reading husband does help with that).  In general, I rate based on the enjoyment I get out of, the acting and the plot.I agree with this. Although I don't have a nonbook reading spouse, I do have many friends who are still in the dark as per what lies ahead and they do indeed help.
3779	bluemoon	2013-04-23	I use the fuck yeah method and the more i say it, the higher i rate it, If i had a swear jar for this episode even the Iron bank could not help.
3780	MoA«t	2013-04-23	For me it's like going to a restaurant. I walk in expecting to leave 20% for good service. If you blow my mind, you get 25% (or more.) If you suck, have a bad attitude, are slow, forget stuff (while not being slammed), and have a shit attitude, not only will I lower your tip to 10%, but I'll speak to the manager. If you're a total loser you get 8% and a complaint.
As a former server, I understand that the law is everyone must declare 8% of your sales as tips, whether or not you actually get that, and 100% of all credit card tips because those are trackable if you're ever audited. I don't stiff anyone. I also understand kitchen fuckups aren't server fuckups. (If my steak isn't rare, it's going back.)
I expect every episode to be a 10 when I watch it. So far they've never let me down. It's a shame I can't give things like 10cubed! (I really hate that this board isn't all-ascii-friendly.)

3781	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-23	I usually am quite thoughtful with my ratings but every now and again something is just SO GOOD and my gut reaction is 'HOLY FUCKING SHIT' that it just has to be given a 10. This episode was one of them.
3782	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-23	Like the OP, I completely distance the show from the books. It should be judged on the merits of a TV show first and foremost, and not on how well it adapts the source material. I don't deduct marks for changes from the books. I don't deduct marks if a character does something which goes against their character in the books, as it's become really obvious that the characters on the books and show are different. As long as it's within their show character to do so, I'm fine with it. Which is why I wasn't so upset with Cat's monologue about Jon. For the most part, it was in character with TV Catelyn.
I also look at the entertainment factor and how well it tells a story. The plot should not move a mile a minute, and I think many people here get upset when the show does one-off scenes that don't advance the plot. Personally, I think such scenes are necessary. Give the audience a few minutes to cool down before launching into the next plot development scene.
Like any other show, I tend to stay away from giving 10s, unless it truly is something special (Baelor, Blackwater).
3783	Er Rn	2013-04-23	If I'm entertained for an hour with good writing, acting, and a cohesive story, I'll rate it high. 
I love to nitpick the hell out of it in terms of book deviations with a reader friend, but try not to let that detract from it's rating in terms of the TV show only. Some changes are too big to ignore, though, and I feel take away from the story as a whole (I'm looking at you, Talisa).
3784	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-23	So far the worst, and most idiotic change they've made that actually detracts from the story is Cat releasing Jaime and Robb marrying before learning of Bran and Rickon's deaths.
3785	Mladen	2013-04-23	For me, it`s also about instincts. But, I also disect each episode, scene by scene. I think about it and then I make the final decision. BUt, if the first impression was bad, no thinking would ever be able to correct that.
S03E04 of Game of thrones for me was somewhere 9,7-9,8. The length of Theon`s arc has become too much for me. It`s annoying, and the worst thing is that we don`t see cruelty and madness of Ramsay`s actions. It`s all cut down into small pieces and it last for two long.2,3 episodes would be enough for that arc, and now I think we`ll see Theon in every episode.
Also, another great plus is lack of Bronn. I seriously became annoyed by his appearence. Luckily, we have Beric now, a new badass has arrived.
So, it`s all about that moment in which you can`t hold your breath out of excitement, and just saying `this was brilliant`. Firt impression with these things is everything /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
3786	Dove	2013-04-23	The only time I'll subtract anything for a deviation from the book is when I feel as though it's a change that actually hurts the narrative of the TV show. Otherwise, I see them as two seperate beasts that enhance my enjoyment of each other and grade the episodes depending on their quality as a stand-alone thing in addition to an adaptation. It's much more enjoyable and much less stressful than getting mad at every little change or whatever.
3787	Ser Creighton	2013-04-23	I do it episode by episode, and it's pretty simple. How much did I enjoy this week? I actually try not to compare it directly to other shows. And honestly what show out there can you compare it to? Like I  love Archer, but their is nothing to compare. Walking dead, Justified, you can't really compare them. Just like I would not compare a Monet to a Picasso, you don't compare Seurat to Rousseau. I look for different things from different shows, because each show is different and deserves to rated on it's own merits and what it is trying ot achive.
Granted it's tv and not painting, but you should get the general idea. I do incorperate some of the books into judging the show. I have read the books, it can't really be helped. If their is something from the books I am hoping to see and then it is not put in the series of course I am going to be disappointed.
Also it's HBO, I pay extra from HBO and I expect the best from HBO, mostly because of their excellent track record. So it's going to be a higher standard I judge the shows with. Thrones has been one of the best shows on TV but that does not mean every episode is great. They have had some lemons and some gems. Certain moments can be brutal, Shea and Tyrion. It doesn't work and the added scenes are brutal. I will hammer the show when something meaning full is cut from the books in favor a meangless Shea and Tyrion scene. That whole sitcom dialogue scene where Shea talks about Sansa and Tyrion is one of if not thee most brutal scenes in the shows history. Ruined the episode for me, the whole thing was so out of place and I felt like I was watching A game of Friends. They also seem to have gutted the Jon Snow and the Knights Watch arc. Like I never felt like they made a long march to Crasters, or that they were starving, or that anyting was getting tense. It felt like they marched for a day and were there for a day or two at most. No desperation in those scenes at all.
However as a whole that episode had so many good moments that even one or two not so good moments it still end up as an excellent watch. It's odd, the show always seems to be either kind of a buildup episode or an epic episode that has like one or two bad scenes and like 10 great moments. I have all but given up on Jon and the Nights watch ever being anything good and it's a shame as it takes away from the story.
3788	Shitmouth the Wise	2013-04-23	Gut feeling. 10 being perfect, 9 being excellent, 8 being really good, 7 being pretty good. I don't think I've ever given an episode less than 7 since the sheer talent of the actors and production value overall is just so good, tied in with the overall excellent source material, I don't ever find an episode not to be rated at least "Pretty good" by me.This isn't really compared to other TV Shows, books, movies, or anything like that. It's just a feeling of entertainment I get from watching it.This is how I do it.  Never given out a 10 though, and I think a 7 only once.
3789	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-23	This is how I do it.  Never given out a 10 though, and I think a 7 only once.I haven't given a 10 yet either because I don't feel any episode has really being absolutely perfect. I'm hoping we get one this season. Episode 9 could very well be a 10.
3790	Mulled Wino	2013-04-24	Ive never seen anyone say or even insinuate that they rate it vs how it compares to the books.
3791	The hairy bear	2013-04-24	IMO, it would we helpful to include a guideline for voting at the top of the poll.
*It should be established whether we are ranking within the show itself, or in relation to others: Is 10 supposed to be (1.a) the best episode of GoT, or (1.b ) the best episode of any series in tv?
*Then agree on the lower ranks: (2.a) the worst episode of GoT should get a 0 (because it's the worst) or (2.b ) about a 5 (beacuse it still "passes").
I personally us the 1.a and 2.b criteria.

3792	Sun	2013-04-24	I have often rated episodes on other shows 10s before, Deadwood, BSG, Life on Mars and Rome come to mind immediately, but I've not done it for GOT yet. My 10s tend to come out based exclusively on the writing, the quality of the words. CGI, production values, and action sequences never rate that high for me. The quality of the writing on GOT just hasn't reached that level for me. In fact, i've often found it to be its weakest element.

3793	Kienn	2013-04-24	I start at a 6 then subtract for bad/terrible scenes (see season 2 conversation where Tyrion says he wants to keep playing the game - really awkward work in for the show title or something, no clue what they were thinking with that writing) and add for good/great scenes.
Obviously people will disagree about which scenes are bad/good. As far as the books, I'm kind of giving a pass to the Theon scenes which I think would be confusing if I hadn't read the books - but the books made it clearly confusing on purpose so I let it pass for now, with the assumption it will pay off later in the show as well.
I also give a pass for the Bran scenes - I think Bran's story is pretty awful in the show sadly... in the books(where Bran is one of my favorites) it takes a lot of exposition which just isn't going to work on screen and I don't think they've gone with a good substitute. Of course I don't have a better idea for him but that's not the point!
3794	Kaitscralt	2013-04-24	I give every episode a 10 because, duh, HBO is doing an adaptation of ASoIaF.

3796	Sun	2013-04-24	this strikes me as a bit extreme. the quality of the acting doesnt matter to you? the cinematography? set design?ofcourse they do, combined with decent writing they can take the show a fair way up the ratings scale. But a rating of 10 is predicated on superb writing on top of everything else.
3797	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-04-24	I rate it very high because I rate it as a TV show. I am avid TV watcher and there simply is not another show on television that has the high quality of acting, storyline and overall themes and the direction and look that this show has. I'd probably never go lower than a 7 for an episode of GoT and I haven't voted a 7 yet for this season. The acting on this show is absolutely superb, the story is well-done and is an adaptation that shows both respect and love for the source material. Obviously the locations and cinematography and the special effects and CGI are outstanding for a television program.  One of the things not discussed that often, but that is really standing out for me is the costuming and especially this season - whoever is behind these designs is pretty amazing. I love all of the clothing and how each character has a style that is adapted to their personality down to the small detail that once Sansa saw the Lannisters for who they really are that she has stopped wearing her hair in the Southern styles that they Lannisters wear and now is back to wear her hair simply, like her mother.
It's easy to criticize some of the changes made for the TV adaptation, but I am fine with most of them. Probably the only ones that really bother me are Catelyn's storyline being very diluted as far as showing her political astuteness and I think it was a mistake to have her release Jaime before she 'knew' that Bran and Rickon were dead. I don't like Asha's portrayal, but she's a minor character so it doesn't really matter all that much.  And one of the biggest mistakes was Arya's escape from Harrenhall, I thought it was really important to see Arya being the mastermind behind her escape rather than her essentially being rescued by someone else along with other details I won't get into since this is a non-spoiler thread.  I like GRRM story here because he really does write female character as being the actors in their own stories and some of that has been taken away in the TV show with the men doing the actions that the females did in the books. I don't like that.
3798	PetyrPunkinhead	2013-04-24	I watched S1 & S2 w/out ever having read the books, and went in w/ little expectation and much speculation. So every episode of the those two seasons were an 8-10 for me. With S3, it's different b/c now I've read the first four books and come in to the episodes w/ more expectations. The first two episodes of S3 were probably the most disappointed I've ever been in the series. However, episodes 3 & 4 either met or exceeded most of my expectations. I rated them both as a 9.
I'm not sure how anyone could rate any episode below a 6 or a 5. And giving any episode thus far a one is just ludicrous to me. For it to rate a 1 they'd have to have something completely catastrophic like turning Jon Snow in to a glittering vampire that falls in love with Joffry while breaking in to a GLEE-esque cover of a Justin Bieber song.
3799	JonDunn	2013-04-22	More and more I think we'll see UnCat this season. Bran's dream of Cat turning paler and paler and more aggressive and evil in his dream feels like a foreshadowing.
3800	Delmas	2013-04-22	he is a greenseer, however I see no reason this imples this season, just as likely to be the opener for next.
3801	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-04-22	it doesn't need to be this season, you could have it be anytime from the RW to maybe a couple episodes before Brienne meets the BWB.
3802	Turin Turambar	2013-04-22	"Promise me, promise me!"
Am I the only one who sees a parallel with Eddard and Lyanna?

3807	brAnthelAstgreenseer	2013-04-22	Imo it was a good dream and his plot would be the most difficult to convey to the t.v audience with all the warging and greendreams.I think he needs to get atleast 5 mins in the episodes in which they show him,otherwise it just comes out confusing and pointless.
3808	jons nissa	2013-04-22	"Promise me, promise me!"Am I the only one who sees a parallel with Eddard and Lyanna?yes, the parallel was very obvious but it made me wonder if the flashbacks will be shown to us through bran's dreams. it shows his "powers" and gives him more to do besides just heading north to meet the cotf and bloodraven as well as providing tv viewers access to important informtaion from the past.eta:Imo it was a good dream and his plot would be the most difficult to convey to the t.v audience with all the warging and greendreams.I think he needs to get atleast 5 mins in the episodes in which they show him,otherwise it just comes out confusing and pointless.i agree.

Bran's dreams coupled with Joff's lines about Targs in the Sept of Baelor makes me hopeful that we will soon finally start to see some of the backstory through those flashbacks.
3810	Warrior Queen	2013-04-22	First of all: put [Book spoilers] in the title of the topic please. Now people might think that it's spoiler free, start to google Uncat and there you have it. Spoiled the RW.I'm really enjoying these dreams that bran is having, nice to see him interacting with people we haven't seen him with in a long time.Me too! I loved the previous one, with Jon and Robb and Ned's voice. It's like a haunted memory of how easy life used to be.The one with Cat is definitely foreshadowing of her becoming UnCat.You guys saying the Lyanna told Eddard to stop climbing?  /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />7 against 3?Maybe it was a tall tower /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />I picture Eddard scaling the tower of joy with climbing hooks and all. I see Howland Reed holding the climbing cord and saving Eddard's life when he was about to fall.I think we figured it all out. This has huge parallels with Jon climbing the wall. Maybe that's why he survived it, he has made such a climb before after all!

3812	Frey Pie a la Mode	2013-04-22	It was sad, though. He was so happy to see Mom in the dream, and then she gets all weird and demanding /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />. And then basically pushes him out of the tree! Poor Bran; he just wants his family back.
3813	Stannis' shadow babies	2013-04-22	I rewatched and it is quite clear that Cat changes during the dream and looks 
	Spoiler dead
. I also think they made it look as Jojen understood the meaning of the dream (he looked rather sad), but Bran didn't.

3815	Bayard	2013-04-22	Well, the first time I saw the dream, it annoyed me... I took only the part about Cat being mean and obsessive. Not even after reading the first opinions about her being UnCat did I think it was more than a connection with "promise me". I finally watched the scene again, and it scared me a lot!! She does look dead!! Creepy creepy stuff.
3816	shiola	2013-04-22	I also think they made it look as Jojen understood the meaning of the dream (he looked rather sad), but Bran didn't.How would Jojen have seen the dream though?  He was awake so he couldn't have had the same dream at the same time or anything.  I thought Jojen could just tell from the way Bran woke up that Bran couldn't reach the 3 eyed raven again.
3817	lostinwesteros	2013-04-22	Forgot to click "post" before I moved on and lost it all.... /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />Poor Bran -- hasn't he been through enough without having nightmares?  Catelyn became so much scarier looking with each time she said "Promise Me"  (and I completely missed the bit about the reference to Ned and Lyanna) and, yeah, she was so, so pale.  Then she as good as pushed him out of the tree!!!  I want more of Bran!  We only get a couple of minutes each episode so that his story line is completely confusing to non-book readers.

I hope we get to see some wolf-dreams as well, Bran needs to be established as a warg. But either way, the greendreams/warging are an excellent addition to his story arc. We need as much of this as possible. Maybe it's just that I love me some Bran but I really hope his story gets some more screen-time esp with
	Spoiler Sam and Gilly inevitably meeting them, and the possibility of Ramsay and his men going on a hunt for the missing Stark boys

3821	dtones520	2013-04-23	I think it is more of Bran learning to interpret his Green Dreams. He is hearing a woman's voice say "Promise me! Promise me" and associates it with his mother making him promise not to climb. But there is more to it than that, because what is the point of him dreaming about his mother yell Promise me? Slowly Bran will learn to interpret these dreams and will help TV viewers start learning about the rebellion and the tower of joy and all of the backstory in the series. It will also help give Bran more screen time while he journeys North for a long ass time.
3822	morky	2013-04-23	the final scene in the season will be Dondarrion giving the kiss of life to Catelyn. Goes black on her eyes opening. I hope to god that they also show Nymeria pulling her body out of the water. Then they could flash to Arya waking up. They would have to show some indication of Nymeria and her pack before hand because non-readers have no doubt forgotten about Nymeria.
3823	The Ghost of Winter	2013-04-24	I hope they make references to Nymeria and her pack. Perhaps people complaining about others getting attacked. Or Arya can't sleep because of wolves howling. 
I don't know why but Bran's scene cracked me up. Psycho Cat, woooooow!
3824	LordStoneheart	2013-04-24	I'm really enjoying these dreams that bran is having, nice to see him interacting with people we haven't seen him with in a long time.I really hope this happens with Arya. Is there any scene with Arya and Cat, even the books? I feel like the mother-daughter connection between Arya and Catelyn is often forgotten about
3825	Mark Antony	2013-04-24	I hope to god that they also show Nymeria pulling her body out of the water. Then they could flash to Arya waking up.I would be pissed if they didn't show this
3826	Dove	2013-04-24	Was Arya established as being a warg by this point in the book, or was her first time when she retrieved the body from the river? I honestly don't remember.
3827	devilrob6	2013-04-24	Was Arya established as being a warg by this point in the book, or was her first time when she retrieved the body from the river? I honestly don't remember.Arya had a wolf dream after escaping from Harrenhal with Gendry and Hot Pie. She dreamed that some of the Bloody Mummers were following them and were killed by (i presume) Nymeria.
3828	Slingingstones	2013-04-24	I more I view the Cat and Bran scene, the scarier it becomes.   It reminded me a little of the evil transition Bilbo goes through when demanding Frodo let him have "the ring".
3829	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-24	the final scene in the season will be Dondarrion giving the kiss of life to Catelyn. Goes black on her eyes opening.

Slowly Bran will learn to interpret these dreams and will help TV viewers start learning about the rebellion and the tower of joy and all of the backstory in the series. It will also help give Bran more screen time while he journeys North for a long ass time.I really thought something along these lines as well, and also that green dreams share might share a characteristic with ordinary dreams - that experiences from very different situations, times and places can blend together in strange ways. Only in this case, his own experiences blend with an event from history, namely what happened at the Tower of Joy. At least I hope this is the intention of the writers, because I think it would be a good starting point in delving deeper into the backstory. Also, I REALLY hope that they do actual footage for the ToJ. Maybe Bran could also have the vision of Rhaegar and Elia? Since Dany didn't.
3831	crazibouncer	2013-04-24	I like the unCat foreshadowing theory.  Catelyn was seriously angry and kind of freaked me out.  Bran seemed frightened too.  I think the last scene this season will be the epilogue of book 3.
3832	RottenAppleFossoway	2013-04-24	I agree.  But, to be fair, he has so little material to stretch over the next two seasons...With the dream sequences being like they are in the show, I'm hoping that Westerosi history and Stark family history will be conveyed through them. That would give Bran plenty of extra scenes going forward. I also thought "promise me" was a nod to The Ned, just that it was garbled and mixed with Cat... The kind of thing that happens with dreams sometimes.
3833	Frey Pie a la Mode	2013-04-24	I really hope this happens with Arya. Is there any scene with Arya and Cat, even the books? I feel like the mother-daughter connection between Arya and Catelyn is often forgotten aboutI never had the sense that there was much connection between them. Arya was her father's daughter (the one who looked like him) and she wanted to do all the things the boys did. Cat wanted her to be a proper lady like Sansa, which just wasn't happening, so I think they were very frustrated with each other. It's so so sad that there was not time for this to be mended. Arya was so close to Cat, just outside the buildings of the RW, but there was no reunion.Of all the things I hope for most as the series moves forward, it's that Arya will get to see UnCat before her final rest, and that that will melt her undead stone heart.
3834	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-04-24	How would Jojen have seen the dream though?  He was awake so he couldn't have had the same dream at the same time or anything.  I thought Jojen could just tell from the way Bran woke up that Bran couldn't reach the 3 eyed raven again.Jojen is in the dream so that is where the idea that he dreamed it came from.Why does he have to have the dream at the same time? When dealing with magic it is not out of the ordinary to think that they could have the same dream at a different time, they obviously have a different perspective from one another.
3835	Birdsong65	2013-04-24	I never had the sense that there was much connection between them.

I'd link it here, but I'm too old to figure out how.  Suffice to say that my theory is that Arya is Cat, if Catelyn were to disregard all the social conventions/expectations that are placed on Westerosi, high-born women, culminating in their eventual transformations into Lady Stoneheart and NoOne, two characters who share identical motivations, mirror images of one another.  From the beginning, I've always held that Arya is more like the real Catelyn than she ever was to either Ned or Lyanna, though those two are the more popular comparisons.I just recently re-read aSoS, and had completely forgotten that when Arya is refusing the gift of mercy to The Hound she states as one of her reasons, "You should have saved my mother."  I thought it interesting, given the thread topic, that it was her mother she felt should have been saved, but mentions nothing of her brother Robb, TKoTN.  In fact, she doesn't even mention him.  Also, she chooses the name "Cat, of the canals" later, just as Sansa, the child most associated to Catelyn, suggests Catelyn as her "new" name as LF's daughter.  I think that GRRM was very deliberate in having Arya/Nymeria find Catelyn, rather than some random pack of wolves/animals, and I believe that it was meant to illustrate that the two were more connected than most would think, possibly more than Cat with any of her other four children, even while warging or three days dead. That's my opinion, anyway.I'll suffer a million Roz/Pod, the prepubescent sex god, scenes if we get the Arya/Nymeria finds Catelyn scene.  I swear
3836	Frey Pie a la Mode	2013-04-24	[/background][/left][/font][/color]About a year ago, on another thread, I wrote a long explanation re: the Cat and Arya connection.  I'd link it here, but I'm too old to figure out how.  Suffice to say that my theory is that Arya is Cat, if Catelyn were to disregard all the social conventions/expectations that are placed on Westerosi, high-born women, culminating in their eventual transformations into Lady Stoneheart and NoOne, two characters who share identical motivations, mirror images of one another.  From the beginning, I've always held that Arya is more like the real Catelyn than she ever was to either Ned or Lyanna, though those two are the more popular comparisons.I just recently re-read aSoS, and had completely forgotten that when Arya is refusing the gift of mercy to The Hound she states as one of her reasons, "You should have saved my mother."  I thought it interesting, given the thread topic, that it was her mother she felt should have been saved, but mentions nothing of her brother Robb, TKoTN.  In fact, she doesn't even mention him.  Also, she chooses the name "Cat, of the canals" later, just as Sansa, the child most associated to Catelyn, suggests Catelyn as her "new" name as LF's daughter.  I think that GRRM was very deliberate in having Arya/Nymeria find Catelyn, rather than some random pack of wolves/animals, and I believe that it was meant to illustrate that the two were more connected than most would think, possibly more than Cat with any of her other four children, even while warging or three days dead. That's my opinion, anyway.I'll suffer a million Roz/Pod, the prepubescent sex god, scenes if we get the Arya/Nymeria finds Catelyn scene.  I swear That does make a lot of sense to me. Thank you for summarizing your post.I envision an Arya/UnCat reunion that ends with Arya giving her mama the gift, with love and pity and regret for what might have been.
3837	Kasrith	2013-04-24	"Promise me, promise me!"Am I the only one who sees a parallel with Eddard and Lyanna?I'm right there with you. Although I didn't pick it up on the first watch through, on the rewatch my jaw def dropped
3838	dtones520	2013-04-24	I really thought something along these lines as well, and also that green dreams share might share a characteristic with ordinary dreams - that experiences from very different situations, times and places can blend together in strange ways. Only in this case, his own experiences blend with an event from history, namely what happened at the Tower of Joy. At least I hope this is the intention of the writers, because I think it would be a good starting point in delving deeper into the backstory. Also, I REALLY hope that they do actual footage for the ToJ. Maybe Bran could also have the vision of Rhaegar and Elia? Since Dany didn't.That vision would make no sense to Bran, unless you cut out the part with Rhaegar looking right at Dany and telling her there must be three heads of the dragon. I think Bran will only see his families history with the war, as it is a part of his DNA, or something along those lines.
3839	The Red Pope	2013-04-02	In my view at least, this title must surely refer to LC Mormont.
This will definitely be one of the greatest and saddest moments in this season. I will look forward to it, but also dread it because it will mean the loss of one of best characters in the show.
James Cosmo is every inch a lord commander on screen and when I read the books I always heard his voice in my head during the Old Bear's lines. A shame to lose him, but Valar Morghulis I suppose...
Do you agree with me or do you have any other suggestions for the reason behind the title?
And more importantly, how do you feel about parting with the Old Bear?
3840	Qhorin Fivehands	2013-04-03	it unfortunately must be Mormont, as its fits in quite well with the storyline. I think its a beautiful title for the episode, and like you I will be filled with both excitement and dread, as he was always a fave in the books.
Or D&D could fuck us and kill off sam.
3841	TomBadgerlock	2013-04-03	I think it will refer to both the death of the Old Bear, which will be utterly, utterly devastating more so than the RW in my opinion, and also Jon deciding to abandon the NW completely. Obviously he'll change his mind later on but at that point he'll "decide" to stay with the Free Folk and with Ygritte. Perhaps it'll be the moment when he...ahem, breaks his vows.
3842	Titus Pullo	2013-04-03	Jon doesn't find out about Mormont until a bit later, I thought. ... If I remember that correctly, I don't see how Mormont effects his decision one way or the other. ... And I never got the serious feeling he ever decided to "stay with the Free Folk."
3843	Hellfell	2013-04-03	He never was a true turncloak in the books because we saw his inner thoughts. On the show, hovewer, all Jon's dialogue will suggest that he genuinely changed sides. It should be good to watch
3844	Abaddon	2013-04-03	Jon doesn't find out about Mormont until a bit later, I thought. ... If I remember that correctly, I don't see how Mormont effects his decision one way or the other.The point wasn't that one affects the other, just that they are thematically linked and we will see both in this episode.  I agree.And I never got the serious feeling he ever decided to "stay with the Free Folk."Not in the books, no.  I get the feeling we're going to see Jon waffling with the idea of really going over in the show, unfortunately.  Not a big fan of that if it happens, but it seems likely.
3845	shiola	2013-04-03	Mormont, and I am super excited for this scene, in the sense that I want it to be very depressing... I hope it is done well (and I'm sure it will be).
Maybe Jon sleeps with Ygritte for the first time, too?  Breaking his vows?
3846	Tony Soprano	2013-04-03	It's going to be Lord Commander Mormont, without a doubt. It's one of the saddest scenes in the entire series for me, so I hope they did a good job with it. Or D&D could fuck us and kill off sam.That's not gonna happen. Why would they kill him off? The actor is a series regular, and they'll need to make use of the character in future seasons. His arc is pretty important.
3847	tito5601	2013-04-03	lc mormont will most likely die this ep and itll suck because i like him alot but i dont think that jon will break his vows this ep i believe itl be in the next one titled ''kissed by fire''
3848	Arale	2013-04-03	Yes, it's definetely going to be the Old Bear. I dread that moment, when I read about it in the book I broke down in tears....it was almost as bad as when Ned died, I had great affection and admiration for the Lord commander, one of the few truly honorable men in the saga. /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />

3862	LordStoneheart	2013-04-06	It's hard to keep track of some dothraki characters. Girls end in I (Irri, Jhiqui) and guys end in O (Mago, Qotho, Drogo, Ogo, Jhogo, Aggo.)
Fun fact that most fans probably know, Frodo Baggins' father was named Drogo. Its the first thing I noticed when reading Daenerys chapter 1.

Which is epic foreshadowing btw for DwD...
3866	TheEvilKing	2013-04-07	It refers to Mormont. However I think the showrunners will swerve show fans by having Hoster Tully's funeral this ep too, so people will think it refer to him.
3867	ebevan91	2013-04-07	After seeing the preview for next week's episode, I'm not so sure the mutiny is in this episode. Maybe the burning of his body will be in this episode though?
3868	KoishNoish	2013-04-08	Yeah, sorry Old Crow /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' /> But I think, like others, it will also refer to Jon.
3869	Rhaegarsjoy	2013-04-08	It seems too soon for the old bear to die when are they gonna find out about the dragonglass?
3870	Brandon Ice Eyes	2013-04-08	Im not looking forward to this as well, however I hope Sam will kill a white walker like in the books and become Sam the Slayer

3872	anafromwinterfell	2013-04-09	I just think this would be the part where Jon will finally sleep with Ygritte. This would be part of breaking his vows.
3873	Great Winter Knight	2013-04-09	I think it will refer to both the death of the Old Bear, which will be utterly, utterly devastating more so than the RW in my opinion, and also Jon deciding to abandon the NW completely. Obviously he'll change his mind later on but at that point he'll "decide" to stay with the Free Folk and with Ygritte. Perhaps it'll be the moment when he...ahem, breaks his vows.I don't remember JS ever truly abondoning the NW. Even when he was breaking his vows with Ygritte he still was part of the NW.  As much as I wanted him to say screw it to the NW.
3874	Stannis' shadow babies	2013-04-09	I'm sure it's about Mormont too. I thought it was one of the saddest parts in the books, he was a good man. In fact, I think he and Davos are the only good, honest men in the series.
3875	shiola	2013-04-09	Mormont's death crushed me on the re-read a few weeks ago.  I don't want to see it on TV :c
3876	shiola	2013-04-09	The Lord's Kiss stuff will be next episode after this, I'd imagine.  But they slept together before they cave scene iirc.  And one of Jon's chapters ended with her saying something about how "best find another spot for your wolf to sleep, because we's fucking's tonight."  So maybe it will just have her saying that.
3877	insertname	2013-04-09	It seems too soon for the old bear to die when are they gonna find out about the dragonglass?Huh? What do you mean? They did find the Dragonglass in Season 2 right? And as for Sam the Slayer, they can more or less shove that in at any time before they get to the wall...

3883	WinterWarrior	2013-04-10	Yes, the Old Bear. It will be sad.
3884	Winterz	2013-04-10	Hopefully he'll be able to take at least a few with him before he dies. Jory took 2, Yoren took 3 or 4 (which I think should be more regardless of the show trying to be more realistic, Yoren was too badass), if the Old Bear just dies with a stab in the back (well I mean, non-literally /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />) I'll be very mad. He'll have to die of at least a hundred wounds or I'll not be pleased.
I also feel it will come as pretty shocking to non-book readers. I mean we're yet to see any dislike towards the Old Bear to the point of betraying their vows and even killing him though I'm sure next week's episode will develop that part, Sam slowing them down may even be a sort of catalyst.

3885	Maester Tormund	2013-04-13	I dont know what they would have to do timeline wise buuuuuuuut
Episode begins with NW getting to Crasters keep, little bit of stuff going on there to fill up some time.
Cut to Jon with the Wildlings.  They camp near the caves (make the cave part the first time Jon breaks his vows, IIRC it wasnt the first time he did but the most memorable)
Next they show the NW eating at Crasters.  Things are getting rowdy.
Next scene is Jon with Ygritte in the cave. she slips off her furs, he steps closer...
Back to Crasters, things spiraling out of control
Back to the cave, Jon leans in and asks something stupid Ygritte says "You know nothing Jon Snow" 
Back to Crasters, we see Mormont killed
Back to the Cave Ygritte and Jon kissing and getting jiggy with it.  Meanwhile an instrumental version of "I Am The Last of the Giants" (which they better have at some point) plays.
We think the episode is over but theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
Sam is through the woods, running, Gilly is trying to keep up, and then BOOM
Smack dab into a man dressed all in black, a hood pulled over his face.
Sam asks, "Brother?"
We see black hands reach towards Sam and glowing blue eyes from the shadows of the cowl.
Episode over.
Sprinkle in some scenes down in KL and maybe some of Dany or Arya and we've got a damn good episode if you ask me.

3889	Anarchosaurus Rex	2013-04-14	From tonight's preview, it has to be Jeor Mormont. Hostilities erupt at Craster's Keep and Mormont is killed in combat.
It's a shame, because Jeor was a strong commander. Anyone who could lead an army of proud lordlings and hardened criminals must have been truly talented. Jon could have learned so much more from Jeor if he had the opportunity.
3890	TheBastardofBluegrass	2013-04-14	Crackpot wild-card time, the title obviously refers to Balon Greyjoy

3899	Sp_ey_der	2013-04-15	Hound is freaking brilliant in that teaser.
3900	Lord Martin	2013-04-15	I find that the titles usually have several meanings for the story line.
For instance the episode in season 1 "Golden Crown" was literally when Visery's got his golden crown.  But it was also the episode when Ned figured out the Lannister's were not Robert's by virtue of their "golden crowns."
Similarly, I expect episode 5 "Kissed by Fire" to be about Jon falling for Ygritte, Beric vs. the Hound and probably something with Mel.
So "now his watch is ended" could have multiple meanings.  The Old Bear is pretty obvious to me.  Any others jump to mind?
My bet is Karstark kills the prisoners and may lose his head too.
Any chance Barristan tells of Jorah's betrayal of Dany and she dismisses him?
3901	JMJ	2013-04-15	It the books, there's a critical interaction between LC Mormont and Sam before the LC dies. Sam had killed the Other with dragonglass, and is Mormont who realizes the importance of the dragonglass and that the NW and the Wall are meant to protect mankind from the Others, not from random wildlings. Now that the crew is camped out at Crasters, I don't see how there's enough time for Sam to kill and Other and for Mormont to reflect on that.
So, somehow, the importance of the dragonglass and the realization of the original purpose of the NW has to be revealed another way, it would seem.
ETA: Perhaps there's an Other lurking around Crasters?

3902	King of the North(west)	2013-04-15	How about Kraznys (or however you spell the unsullied slaver guy) getting his eyes melted by Drogon. His watch certainly ends there
3903	Winter's Prince	2013-04-15	All over some fucking food. I think Rast will be the one to kill Mormont. And remember that guy from last night who smiled at Craster's wives, he'll be an instigator too.

And remember that guy from last night who smiled at Craster's wives, he'll be an instigator too.Yeah, given Rast was absent from season 2, i'm guessing the main reason he was brought back for this season was to be the main member of the mutiny.
3905	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-04-15	I spoiled myself for RW but did not for this one. I was shocked and sad. It was definitely building to this one being Commander Mormont.  I like the idea that the title has several meanings and therefore, can apply to Kraznys too.  That part of the episode will make up for losing the Old Bear.

3907	KSims1868	2013-04-15	The titles (other than the golden crown) have been semi-misleading, so I don't know what to expect.
But that quick scene with Varys and Tyrion has me very curious.  What (or who) the hell are they looking at/down into?

3909	Northbound	2013-04-15	It's about the Old Bear. His death is central to the upcoming changes with the NW. I just hope they don't cut out the Lord Commander's dying wish, while being held by Sam.
3910	Koril	2013-04-15	I just hope they don't cut out the Lord Commander's dying wish, while being held by Sam.I'm quite confident they will do that, I think the focus on that "I want to fight for the side that fight for the livings" stuff is some sort of foreshadowing about that scene, and what's next. I'm looking forward that last James Cosmo's act on next episode, it should be a great end to the great job he did here.
3911	Mammothsbane	2013-04-15	Dreading the mutiny at Craster's Keep more than the Red Wedding.

3915	Dubbs	2013-04-16	I definitely agree Mormont is going to die in this episode, but as a previous poster mentioned there are usually dual meanings. I believe Jon Snow will likely break his vows with Ygritte in this episode as well, in a sense signifying that his "watch has ended" by becoming a turncloak.
3916	Rhasgul	2013-04-17	Like many others I think Mormont will die here, I'm even sure, and I will feel bad about it. He really liked him /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
Other than that, I don't think Jon will be breaking his vows here. I think it will be kept for the "kissed by fire" in the next episode. Just seems more logical to me. I do expect a certain Kastark to lose his head here though.
3917	fossilfish	2013-04-17	It the books, there's a critical interaction between LC Mormont and Sam before the LC dies. Sam had killed the Other with dragonglass, and is Mormont who realizes the importance of the dragonglass and that the NW and the Wall are meant to protect mankind from the Others, not from random wildlings. Now that the crew is camped out at Crasters, I don't see how there's enough time for Sam to kill and Other and for Mormont to reflect on that.So, somehow, the importance of the dragonglass and the realization of the original purpose of the NW has to be revealed another way, it would seem.ETA: Perhaps there's an Other lurking around Crasters?Gilly just had a boy. Maybe there's some Other waiting outside? Then Sam will kill him/it to save Gilly's boy?
3918	Our Blades Are Sharp	2013-04-17	that was my thought as wellGilly just had a boy. Maybe there's some Other waiting outside? Then Sam will kill him/it to save Gilly's boy?
3919	victim	2013-04-17	I think Rast will kill Mormont and (Burn Gorman) will kill Craster. I really loved Jeor's dying request about Jorah as he lay dying in Sam's arms. I hope it's included.
Also, we've seen in trailers a White Walker that looks to be somewhere in the Haunted Forest, but I don't think Sam the Slayer will happen just yet. Surely they need to show off the dragonglass and reacquaint viewers with it before that all goes down.
3920	Qhorin Fivehands	2013-04-17	That's episode 5. Strange but I think that Jon won't be in episode 4. He is in episode 1, 2 and 3. So why rush his story?And I'm happy that 
	Spoiler  Sam the Slayer 
 will be happening later on in the season.How do you know Sam the Slayer is happening?
3921	King Tommen	2013-04-17	There's footage from pretty much every trailer they've released of the season showing Sam and Gilly being stalked by a WW in the woods. There's a decent chance it's the same fella who stared Sam down in the S2 finale.  The same actor is scheduled to appear in E7 so that's probably when you'll get it.  And based on the synopsis, it looks like they run into Coldhands in the following episode.
If they follow the books, Coldhands and his mass of ravens save Sam when he's getting attacked by Small Paul (in wight form) so I'm not sure if they'll have the meet be under the same circumstances.  Total speculation but I could certainly see wight-Rast being put in that role since he'll be the main villain in the mutiny at Craster's and will probably be trying to hunt down Sam when he escapes from there.  It would make sense if they brought him back later in wight form to try and finish him off so they can finish off that character for good.
3922	kevin1989	2013-04-18	How do you know Sam the Slayer is happening?King Tommen explained.@King_Tommen: I'm only afraid that it will not be Sam the slayer but Coldhands the Slayer.
3923	King Tommen	2013-04-18	King Tommen explained.@King_Tommen: I'm only afraid that it will not be Sam the slayer but Coldhands the Slayer.I was initially a little worried about that too but there are a few things that I think point to Sam certainly getting his Slayer moment.1) They would not have bothered to introduce the Dragonglass stash last season if they weren't going to have Sam use it at some point.2) The actor who plays the White Walker is appearing in E7 this year and it's not until the synopsis for E8 that Coldhands looks to appear ("Sam and Gilly meet an older gentleman").The only thing I'm not quite sure of is whether Coldhands will save them from another attack from a wight, which is what happens in the books (hence my wight-Rast speculation) or he just kind of shows up with a mass of ravens to say hi.
3924	Maria Underfoot	2013-04-18	I think that it directly alludes to Mormont. But it might also refer to Jon. Something will happen that will cut him off completely from the NW (probably Jon/Ygritte, and/or Jon will reveal some secret weakness or something like that to Tormund while climbing the wall)
3925	Maria Underfoot	2013-04-18	Any chance Barristan tells of Jorah's betrayal of Dany and she dismisses him?If they stick to the books, they technically need Jorah to do Dany's dirty job in Meereen. Plus, they haven't showed his kiss with Dany, which is something I feel the producers wouldn't like to miss out on. (To be honest, I'd like to see that too. Iain Glen is hot /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /> )

3926	Morrigan	2013-04-18	I think it will refer to both the death of the Old Bear, which will be utterly, utterly devastating more so than the RW in my opinionSame. I was sad at the RW, but I was genuinely pissed off when the Old Bear was murdered, it was just so infuriating and frustrating to read. I'm a bit worried if Sam the Slayer happens in Ep7 and Mormont dies in Ep4, though. Mormont should die after knowing about the dragonglass. Eh. :\
3927	Dove	2013-04-18	Not only was the Old Bear dying really sad, but then everything that happens after the mutiny without him to reign everyone in - ugh. Such a supremely horrifying scene, with the women getting assaulted and all hell breaking lose like that.
3928	Kasrith	2013-04-19	Jon and Mormont... How is this even a thread?
3929	CrypticWeirwood	2013-04-19	There's footage from pretty much every trailer they've released of the season showing Sam and Gilly being stalked by a WW in the woods.

Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s certainly an older gentleman.
3930	Caryn Stark	2013-04-19	I think it definitely refers to the LC Mormont. So sad. I hope we get Sam the Slayer soon.
3931	Warrior Queen	2013-04-20	Sam the Slayer might happen this episode tho. After seeing Gilly giving birth to a son.. i think there will be one right there waiting for the baby boy. When Jon followed Craster last time the other was right there to take the boy. Sam will probbably try to save Gilly's babe.
3932	eRome	2013-04-21	Mormont, but, as with all episode titles, the name applies to more than one character.
3933	Ser Drizztos	2013-04-24	I'd hate to open a new thread for a banal question such as this, so I'll ask here instead.
When they bury the Nightswatch bro, they clearly recite, "And now his watch HAS ended". However, the episode title is "...IS ended". Why the distinction?
3934	BlackTalon	2013-04-24	Just a mistake I guess. Just like Bryan Cogman has just admitted in the interview/Q&A on Wic.net that they had messed up with Lord Karstark offering himself to the "Father" to save his sons he was almost certainly an "Old Gods only" guy.
3935	StannisandDaeny	2013-04-22	So a scene I was hoping to see, but not really expecting, was Jeor's dying wish to Sam. I didn't really expect it to come to this point in the books, omitting it from the series might give us conclusion that Sam will never meet Jorah to tell him his father has forgiven him and wishes him to take the black? At least, it seems that way to me. Maybe Grenn and Dolorous Edd can still hear his dying words, but considering he's deader than dead after Rast's 1 million stabs, I don't see it happening.
3936	Lord Flashheart	2013-04-23	I don't see it happening in the tv series, and frankly I never saw it happening in the  books either. But I wouldn't think for one second that it isn't still possible to happen just based on the tv show. GRRM has mentioned they have made changes that will effect the story down the road.
3937	Joyful Union	2013-04-24	I suppose they thought it would be to cheesy, which in a way is true. Also, I never understood how in all the chaos in Craster's Keep, no one bothers Sam??? I think it was more shocking the way they did, with Rast stabbing him repeatedly.
3938	LordStoneheart	2013-04-24	Yes, now that I look back the show makes more sense. Certain night's watch members really did admire sam after his slayer moment, but most had planned their mutiny beforehand. I find it a bit hard to believe now that Sam was able to just sit back and do nothing during the mutiny, and then is let near Jeor's body to hear his list wish...
I did like that scene though and hope Jorah gets to hear it.
3939	Mulled Wino	2013-04-24	I wasn't disappointed at all.  I thought it didnt make sense in the books with all the chaos going on and would have been awkward on screen, especially with Rast's hate for Sam.  
Very very minor change IMO, no impact.
3940	Joyful Union	2013-04-24	I wasn't disappointed at all.  I thought it didnt make sense in the books with all the chaos going on and would have been awkward on screen, especially with Rast's hate for Sam.  Very very minor change IMO, no impact.Exactly. The mutineers had already shown there distaste for Sam, they murdered almost everyone they could, why wouldn't they try and kill Sam?
3941	Dove	2013-04-24	I thought the 'Ol Bear got a proper sendoff, slamming Rast against the wall even after he'd gotten stabbed in the back. Those prolonged death speeches are always pretty awkward and hammy, so I didn't miss it.
I wasn't expecting it to ever come to fruition in the series anyway, it was just a sad moment for Jeor & Jorah when you realize how different they are.
3942	Theda Baratheon	2013-04-24	Reading this thread and re-watching the scene I have come to accept the show's scene makes a lot more sense. The more I think about it, the more I realise it would have been quite far-fetched to have Sam just walk up to Jeor's body and listen to his dying words as everyone else is killing each other in the chaos of the Mutiny.
3943	SerMixalot	2013-04-24	Plus there was a moment before when Craster asked Mormont if he had any sons, so you could at least see Mormont's regrets or feelings on the matter. Would have liked to hear the words but stillwell done.
3944	Dragonstoned	2013-04-24	Plus there was a moment before when Craster asked Mormont if he had any sons, so you could at least see Mormont's regrets or feelings on the matter. Would have liked to hear the words but stillwell done.Thought this as well, looked like they were setting it up for talking about Jorah.
3945	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-04-22	Cat had a tight scarf wrapped around her neck in Bran's dream.
3946	Mediumjon Umber	2013-04-22	Good catch. Bring on episode 9!
3947	Born Yesterday	2013-04-22	She's been wearing that tight scarf all season, it doesn't mean anything. (I had noticed the scarf in a trailer and wondered the exact same thing, but it was a false alarm after all.)
3948	StarkTagaryen	2013-04-22	She's been wearing that tight scarf all season, it doesn't mean anything. (I had noticed the scarf in a trailer and wondered the exact same thing, but it was a false alarm after all.)correct - but she did seem stone like as she was about to push bran off the tree
3949	Volantis	2013-04-22	So?
3950	Stannis' shadow babies	2013-04-22	I thought it was foreshadowing of sorts, but not for the scarf (I didn't notice it) but because her skin looked like a dead person

3951	A Redeemed Hound	2013-04-22	I do hope the Bran scenes coming up show little things with Catelyn that us readers will understand and viewers will say "Oh crap!" after episode 9.
3952	Flayed Starkman	2013-04-22	I think we're seeing foreshadowing where there isn't any.
I personally was certain, that Cat's face got paler and paler (scarily so) when screaming at Bran, but on rewatch, of course it wasn't true.
3953	StarkDragon	2013-04-22	Did they ever go over the fact Cat didn't want Bran to climb, and that Bran laments on this on his long walk to the Wall?
Cause they might be trying now.
3954	Kasrith	2013-04-22	The Cat stuff is a stretch imo, but the dream was a foreshadowing nod to book readers about the ToJ backstory stuff me thinks.
3955	newwb	2013-04-22	The Cat stuff is a stretch imo, but the dream was a foreshadowing nod to book readers about the ToJ backstory stuff me thinks.yep. her saying 'promise me' made me think of lyanna
3956	King Tommen	2013-04-22	The Cat scene was a mirror of the scene she had with Bran in the very first episode of the series (before he got crippled), it was just a slightly different take that evolved into more urgency (on account that it was a dream sequence). The dialogue is word for word.
No foreshadowing to be had, you're looking to see something that isn't there.
3957	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2013-04-22	The Cat scene was a mirror of the scene she had with Bran in the very first episode of the series (before he got crippled), it was just a slightly different take that evolved into more urgency (on account that it was a dream sequence). The dialogue is word for word.No foreshadowing to be had, you're looking to see something that isn't there.I agree.  No forshadowing involved.  If anything, it's like in the books where he cannot see Jaime's face and he is just replacing it with his mother's warning.
3958	PrinceRhaegar	2013-04-22	Her face indeed becomes pale:http://oi38.tinypic.com/28iq7bt.jpghttp://oi37.tinypic.com/wwc45l.jpgHer eyes were watching. And they were hating.

3959	Masha	2013-04-22	I originally thought foreshadowing to Lady Stoneheart too and it felt like she got paler and paler as she spoke but when I rewatched it shot by shot - it was just trick of light - she didn't get paler and wore that scarf before. So no foreshadowing. false alarm
3960	DaveSnow House Stark	2013-04-22	I swear she got paler as the dream went on
3961	Mark Antony	2013-04-22	I immediately thought of Lady Stoneheart.
3962	BorhPT	2013-04-22	I rewatched it. her face did got paler. You can notice the difference between her normal skin tone and the pale one if you watch her neck and ears compared to her face.
she seems pretty desperate and nervous, like she will be at the RW when she begs for Robb's life and fails
3963	kevin1989	2013-04-23	This has nothing to do with a prediction. It has to do with the mental state of Bran. To be free Bran has to do everything in his dreams that is possible (just like us). If we broke our arm we can still dream about playing baseball. But because just before Bran fall Cat warned him not to climb anymore. This will hold him down. And to fulfill his destiny he needs to let go of this. So probably in the end he will confront his mother and say he can fly.
3964	MoA«t	2013-04-23	It's not a scarf, it's her chemise/shirt under her main dress. Pretty much everyone in Winterfell wears them. Granted, it's a weird design, that gathers at the neck into a thin band that's sewn over it, (and can't be that comfortable.)
And yes, she got paler and more grey (and more feral) as the scene went on. Very subtle and awesome post coloring. Brilliant.

I don't recall any of them discussing bran letting go of his past to meet his destiny until they get toward the end of ADWD. So it seems odd they'd be introducing that so soon. In fact the only thing I remember bran working on his accepting his abilities and encouragement to use them until he starts to over use them and risks starvation as a result.The only character that is prodded to loose their past is Arya.So I don't know if the whole "loosing past" thing will become a greater theme for the series.

3967	Mladen	2013-04-22	First, I`ll have to warn everyone that what is going to be discussed on this topic, seriously contains major spoilers from Storm of Swords, so if you haven`t read the book, I wouldn`t recommend continuing
As we know
	Spoiler Jorah`s bussiness arrangement with Varys was discovered by Barristan the moment old guy was revealed. After that, Daenerys sent Jorah far from her.

Now, giving the fact what we have seen in last night`s episode, and the fact that it seems Barristan and Jorah are quite fine with each other, and the fact that in the show Barristan isn`t member of the Small Council as the Lord Commander of Kingsguard, how do you think Jorah`s past transgressions will we revealed?
This situation is at least problematic, since obviously Barristan doesn`t know anything about Jorah`s past arrangement. So, who will be the one to open Dany`s eyes regarding her favorite and most trusted knight?
3968	freetickles	2013-04-22	It will still be Barristan. What makes you think he obviously doesn't know anything about Jorah's past arrangement? I think the only problem is it's the reveal of Arstan-as-Barristan that prompts Barristan to throw Jorah under the bus. They'll have to come up with another way to make Barristan decide to reveal that, but it won't be tough. They've already laid the groundwork for Barristan being willing to tell Dany about the past when asked.
3969	Thor Odinson	2013-04-22	Nevermind all that. Where the hell is Strong Belwas?!?
3970	StarkDragon	2013-04-22	What if this Jorah is still in communication? 
And just happens to stop, now that she's proven tough? 
But Barristan finds out?
Makes Danny seem less cruel to kick him out if he's only just stopped spying.
3971	FSBA	2013-04-22	Jorah was still sending stuff to Varys as late as the arrival in Qarth in the books, last season's scene with Vary and Tyrion laid the groundwork for that.
3972	Jojosh	2013-04-22	Its still gonna be selmy but now its just gonna be some other betrayal by Jorah that someone like selmy would be privy to
3973	Kasrith	2013-04-22	It's still Selmy. The fact that he wasn't on the council doesn't mean he didn't overhear it as a member of the KG. He could still be in all the right places
3974	SoManyVows	2013-04-22	Though Barristan wasn't explicitly shown to be present at the Small Council meeting in Season 1, Episode 5 where Robert hears Jorah's report and demands that Dany be assasinated, that doesn't necessarily mean that he wasn't a member as he was in the books. More importantly, his absence doesn't mean that Barristan wasn't aware that Jorah was an informant. He'd been making these reports on the Targaryens for a while - Robert just didn't act on them until he learned Dany was pregnant. Given his proximity to the King, Barristan would have heard something.
My guess is that some point this season Barristan will call out Jorah as an informant in private rather than explicitly outing his betrayal to Daenerys. He'll question whether Jorah is still angling for a pardon, and Jorah will swear that those days are done, that he is only loyal to Dany now. Barristan will then grudgingly agree to give him a chance to prove it, while vowing to keep a close eye on him. Eventually the secret will be revealed, though I'm not sure how. Maybe Jorah does something that Barristan thinks endangers Dany or crosses some kind of boundary with regards to his feelings for her, and Barristan exposes the truth in a burst of anger?
However and whenever it happens, Dany probably wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be sending Barristan into the sewers with Jorah, at least not solely on the basis of his service to Robert, as heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s already unveiled himself to her, and she seems to have accepted his loyalty for now. But is she learns that Barristan knew of Jorah's betrayal and kept it from her, that could give her a reason to test Barristan as well.

3975	jonny__bravo	2013-04-22	Judging by the recap for next weeks episode, we are going to see some movenment on Jorah's snitching pretty soon.
3976	Versiroth	2013-04-22	If it does end up being Barristan still, then they need to make him some how find out about it for the first time and then immediately tell Danny.   Him keeping such a secret from his queen just doesn't make any sense.   In the book, it does because he's keeping his identity a secret, but for the show, there's no reason at all for him not to immediately reveal such a thing to Danny.
Maybe Barristan will catch Jorah sending a letter to Varys once they reach Meereen.   That would make way more sense and it would give Danny more of a reason to banish Jorah.  Even though he's sure to tell her that he's only sending sparse info.
3977	Khal Vader	2013-04-22	What do you guys think will propel this dark secret of Jorah's? In the book it was the Selmy reveal that brought up the discussion of secrets that led to Selmy telling Dany about what Jorah had done. Since Selmy was revealed from Episode 1, how then will this information come to light?
3978	Theon the Gimp	2013-04-22	I think it will be done in conjunction with his falling in love with her (which of course has already happened, but will only become intensified after seeing her burn Astapor to the ground, MAJOR...TURN ON for anyone). It could be the kiss that makes her start to question him and then she turns to Barristan who in turn tells her of Jorah's betrayal. Does anyone really think he is still informing? I think that definitely ended a while ago, around the attempted poisoning as it did in the books.
3979	freetickles	2013-04-22	I think it will be done in conjunction with his falling in love with her (which of course has already happened, but will only become intensified after seeing her burn Astapor to the ground, MAJOR...TURN ON for anyone).

I think that definitely ended a while ago, around the attempted poisoning as it did in the books.No way is he still informing. It would go against his whole character - the whole point is that he eventually was in fact truly loyal to her, once he came to fully trust her himself and realize what she was.
3980	Hard Truths Cut Both Ways	2013-04-22	I think there is a chance that Dany will never find out about Jorah's treachery and therefore never send him away.
3981	Roose Seal	2013-04-22	My guess is that as Daario comes into play, Jorah grows jealous and eventually attempts something. Barristan intervenes and they fight and Dany tells them to stop and Barristan spills the beans about Jorah.
3982	Mladen	2013-04-22	You must know that Barristan immediately told her about Jorah. Thr very moment he was discovered. And, yes, we can assume that show Barristan knows something, but greater probability is that he doesn`t. The idea Jorah would do now anything against Daenerys is basically character suicide. for both TV and show, but given we have already 2 character suicide(Catelyn and Podrick), I honestly see this one happening too.I think there is a chance that Dany will never find out about Jorah's treachery and therefore never send him away.You do realize that is one hell of important plot, and that it will have to be done in order to insert Tyrion in Dany`s storyarc.

3983	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-04-22	Jorah distrusts Selmy Anything Barristan says or does could make him try to put him under a bad light, and then, Selmy could simply pull the better card out: "are you still a spy?" in front of Dany. Jorah has no defense nor way to prove him wrong, even when he stopped a long time ago because it's true.
3984	Bayard	2013-04-22	I can see it done with ease, and in the spirit of the book. Jorah gets jealous over Dany's attention towards Ser Barristan. He calls him a traitor to the Targaryen cause, they might have a little discussion, throwing stuff at one another, for example that Jorah fought against Rhaegar on the Trident, whatever... in the end Barristan accuses him of being an informant. He could justify the delay for the revelation, saying that he wanted to measure Jorah... something like that. Not that a big problem... I don't care about him.
3985	Reposado	2013-04-22	I can see it done with ease, and in the spirit of the book. Jorah gets jealous over Dany's attention towards Ser Barristan.

He could justify the delay for the revelation, saying that he wanted to measure Jorah... something like that. Not that a big problem... I don't care about him.i dont know. his justification for keeping this knowledge secret in the show is going to either be world shattering or flimsy.i bet they dont even bother with the sending away jorah part of the plot
3986	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-04-22	Has anyone brought up the fact that Jorah still might have the royal pardon that Varys's little bird gave to him? That document surfacing would be more than enough evidence to expose him.
Then the question becomes why keep that document when clearly he decides to stay by Dany's side? Perhaps it's a worse case scenario. If she dies then that pardon might allow him to return home. 
as far as Barristan not being visible in the small council meeting, is that not what the books claim a good KG is able to do? Be a shadow on the wall? He could be in the room, we just don't notice him because he's off to the side being quiet.
Barristan is right next to Eddard Stark when Ned tells Varys that King Robert has had a change of heart on his death bed concerning the Targaryen girl so he knows of the plot to kill her, he probably knows that Varys had informants on Viserys for quite awhile.
Maybe we'll get a scene between Barristan and Jorah this next episode with Barristan asking why aren't you in Bear Island right now? Did you not get Robert's pardon?
Jorah might reply: I was there the day that Dany hatched her dragons. No one that witnessed that will ever abandon her, Darthaki rode a ship to Astapor with her, they traveled the red waste with her, and I would go through the seven hells with Dany if that is where she wants to go.
3987	Tony Soprano	2013-04-23	They're not fine with each other. Neither of them has spoken out against the other yet, but they haven't been exactly friendly either. They endure each other only to keep Dany happy. Something is bound to happen soon now that Dany's storyline is picking up speed. When the two of them fall out, Selmy will drop the secret, simple as that.
3988	YourMomsBox	2013-04-23	I've only read through SoS so forgive me if I'm being absurd. Is it a possibility that the TV show forgoes Jorah's betrayal, or is that too set in stone as a plot point in the books?

Is it a possibility that the TV show forgoes Jorah's betrayal, or is that too set in stone as a plot point in the books?Really hard to know. Yeah, in one way it's important - when Jorah's in "exile," there's a lot of interaction with other characters in transit (I'll leave it vague). But to be honest I suspect a lot of that could be cut if they just want to get on with the story.But Jorah's relationship with Dany will have to reach some kind of crisis - we'll see how they handle it.

I've totally lost track of what happened in the books versus what happened in the TV show. But that doesn't mean the later exile will have to happen - I don't remember when it happens in the books, but if it happens soon in the TV show, then Ian Glen won't have anything to do for quite a while. (Could he cross paths with Arya at some point, just to help connect her storyline to everything else going on? Although I can't think of any real plot purpose that would serve.)

(Could he cross paths with Arya at some point, just to help connect her storyline to everything else going on? Although I can't think of any real plot purpose that would serve.)Arya is the queen of bumping into random people and the show seems to even increase these people: Tywin, Littlefinger etc. but  I don't see the point of having her meet someone her dad wanted to execute, unless they need to get Jorah off the show...I agree the exile doesn't have to happen, and it probably won't happen yet as there's also clips in trailers of Jorah fighting guards at night, Daario and Grey worm also appear to be fighting along side him. Which means it's Yukhai.I'm only pointing out that there's no way that the 1.5 minute recap that will air before next week's episode(why is it available already anyway?) would point out that Jorah was spying on Dany etc. unless there is a good reason to remind people.In the books Dany learns of Jorah's betrayal when Arristan Whitebeard reveals himself to be Barristan Selmy after saving her life against the Titan's Bastard. Jorah calls Selmy a traitor, so Selmy points out that Jorah is one too. This happens outside the walls of Mareen after their "champion" loses to Strong Belwas.In the show of course Selmy instantly reveals himself when he saves her life the first time from the assassin in Astapor(books he saves her in Quarth but same difference pretty much).I don't understand why Selmy hasn't ratted out Jorah being a spy yet(that is if he knows), he seems like too honorable a man to keep that kind of secret from her grace.My best guess is that Jorah will ask Barristan why he decided to join Dany after betraying her. Selmy might ask him the same question. I just don't think that Dany would let Jorah slide without some consequences. My next best guess is that a "little bird" from Varys will try to talk to Jorah and he'll tell the "little bird" he's done being a spy.If I keep guessing I'm bound to actually get the right answer I suppose.

3993	Mladen	2013-04-23	I can see it done with ease, and in the spirit of the book. Jorah gets jealous over Dany's attention towards Ser Barristan. He calls him a traitor to the Targaryen cause, they might have a little discussion, throwing stuff at one another, for example that Jorah fought against Rhaegar on the Trident, whatever... in the end Barristan accuses him of being an informant. He could justify the delay for the revelation, saying that he wanted to measure Jorah... something like that. Not that a big problem... I don't care about him.It`s all nice and simple, but how would Barristan know Jorah is informant?Has anyone brought up the fact that Jorah still might have the royal pardon that Varys's little bird gave to him? That document surfacing would be more than enough evidence to expose him.Then the question becomes why keep that document when clearly he decides to stay by Dany's side? Perhaps it's a worse case scenario. If she dies then that pardon might allow him to return home.as far as Barristan not being visible in the small council meeting, is that not what the books claim a good KG is able to do? Be a shadow on the wall? He could be in the room, we just don't notice him because he's off to the side being quiet.Barristan is right next to Eddard Stark when Ned tells Varys that King Robert has had a change of heart on his death bed concerning the Targaryen girl so he knows of the plot to kill her, he probably knows that Varys had informants on Viserys for quite awhile.Maybe we'll get a scene between Barristan and Jorah this next episode with Barristan asking why aren't you in Bear Island right now? Did you not get Robert's pardon?Jorah might reply: I was there the day that Dany hatched her dragons. No one that witnessed that will ever abandon her, Darthaki rode a ship to Astapor with her, they traveled the red waste with her, and I would go through the seven hells with Dany if that is where she wants to go.Nica catch about paper. In the books, didn`t he tear it apart or something like that? So, document would be far from existing. As for Barristan being shadow on the wall, that`s true, but it`s also regarding King`s protection, not the role in the Council. Barristan is next to Ned, but I don`t think Jorah`s name was explicitally said. The point is in the books, Barristan straight after revealed accuses Jorah of treason. Now, we don`t have that. The possible solution I see, assumingly Barristan knows something, is that he hides it. And that might be the reason why Dany will send both of them away of her in the first place.
3994	lil_z	2013-04-23	Nevermind all that. Where the hell is Strong Belwas?!?Exactly! Strong Belwas was a wonderful character, who's going to defeat the slavers champion at Yunkai?!
3995	lil_z	2013-04-23	My best guess is that Jorah will ask Barristan why he decided to join Dany after betraying her. Selmy might ask him the same question. I just don't think that Dany would let Jorah slide without some consequences. My next best guess is that a "little bird" from Varys will try to talk to Jorah and he'll tell the "little bird" he's done being a spy.If I keep guessing I'm bound to actually get the right answer I suppose.Nah it wouldn't make sense. The other part that's hinted to in the TV series that also is worked in with Jorah's banishment is Dany calls out his romantic interests in her. I understand why they couldn't introduce Sir Barristan as a mysterious gaurdian in the TV show, it's a lot easier to hide a characters identity in a book. Would have bee like a Dora the Explorer episode were everyone watching would see Sir Barriston but the characters would remain oblvious and laughably clueless.It also is understandable why Barristan didn't declare Jorah as a spy and traitor in the port because Barristans reveal and Jorah's banishment is meant to take place as Dany finds herself seemingly at a dead end and surrounded by people she can't trust. I do think there will be a catalyst to get Barristan or someone else to reveal what Jorah was up to.I know this is kinda of past the SoS book but I'm interested to see how the show presents the many competeing interests in Dany and her Dragons.
3996	jmk51	2013-04-23	My one big literary complaint about the book is the miraculous crossing of paths all the characters have.   Tyrions journey has the "roosters,"  Penny,  the Bear,  and Ben brown. 
Since we don't know exactly what happens at the end of Dragons,  it's wholy possible to skip the banishment and end up at the same place,  depending on what that place is. 
Character assassination of course /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> 
Although the weird lady in Qarth has already hinted at it. 
My best guess?  He confesses to Dany as part of a plea for her hand.
3997	wolverine	2013-04-23	You do realize that is one hell of important plot, and that it will have to be done in order to insert Tyrion in Dany`s storyarc.Incorrect.
3998	Mladen	2013-04-23	Incorrect.As I recall, Tyrion meets Jorah and he decides to take Tyrion to Daenerys, right?
3999	mafalda	2013-04-23	I thought Ser Barristan did sit on the council in the first season? No?
I don't think they're ok with each other, nor do I think they hate each other. I think they're both just very aware of the other's existence. Like when Ser Barry was talking to Dany and he said something like "we need [whatever]" and Jorah said "Is it 'we' already?". I think Jorah might resent the presence of another man whose council Dany trusts, and that it will bug him the whole season until he snaps on Barry, then they will get into some sort of arguement and Barry will reveal Jorah's involvement in her assassination attempt from S1.
... Or DD will have some other random way of having Dany find out. Maybe they will send Ros or something, since she knows everything.
4000	mafalda	2013-04-23	I also wonder if they will ever have him (jorah) kiss Dany.
4001	jmk51	2013-04-23	As I recall, Tyrion meets Jorah and he decides to take Tyrion to Daenerys, right?The key is that it doesn't have to happen like that.  We don't know the final outcome,  so who knows if Jorah ever gets back in her good graces.  Tyrion could just go seek her out after he escapes,  circumventing that whole story arc.
4002	Mladen	2013-04-23	... Or DD will have some other random way of having Dany find out. Maybe they will send Ros or something, since she knows everything.Please don`t give them any ideas. That character if there`s some justice will end up dead like Dontos...The key is that it doesn't have to happen like that.  We don't know the final outcome,  so who knows if Jorah ever gets back in her good graces.  Tyrion could just go seek her out after he escapes,  circumventing that whole story arc.True, but it would be a bit more difficult. Tyrion was already heading towards Daenerys with fAegon`s company, and then Jorah kidnapped him. And considering how good Iain Glen is, we can expect to see a lot from Jorah in TV series. At least, much more than we have him in the books.
4003	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	I've noticed that people were upset with the LF/Sansa scene from Valar Dohaeris, as it gives away a big twist after the Purple Wedding. However, Varys' scenes in this episode have confirmed my suspicions of what I think will happen.
This is where I think the show is going with the LF subplot:
-Given that there is a rivalry between Baelish and Varys on the show, it makes sense that Varys would foil LF's plot to take Sansa with him.
-I'm assuming that the show wants the viewer to believe that Littlefinger was planning to take Sansa with him this season, when he departs from the Vale. This is different from the book, where he always intended to take her back after the Purple Wedding.
-Now, in the next few episodes, LF will be made aware of the fact that Varys found out about his plan, and like in the books, will reveal the Tyrell's intentions to marry Sansa off to Loras. However, he has an added motive in the show, which is his rivalry with Varys
-The viewer will be lead to believe that there is no need for Sansa to leave with Baelish, as she can now marry Loras. However, Loras being appointed into the Kingsguard, and Sansa's forced marriage to Tyrion will dash the viewer's hopes of her escaping KL.
-In season 4, until the PW, the viewers will still believe that Sansa has no other option but to stay married to Tyrion. If the showrunners play their cards right, Littlefinger will be ignored for the first few episodes, thus reducing the viewer's beliefs that he will help Sansa escape.
-That way, after the PW, when Sansa escapes to a boat with Littlefinger on it, the show will still contain an element of suprise, rather than blatantly telegraphing who's behind her escape.
-LF then kills Ros, who helps Sansa escape, revealing that he had found out about her spying on him
By doing this, the show will stay true to the character of LF, showing his ability to adapt and turning anything into an advantage, as well as playing up on the whole LF/Varys rivalry.
Thoughts?

4004	Grandpa House	2013-04-22	I like this. I wasn't that bothered(but still a little) by them revealing that Littlefinger is openly helping Sansa, but I'm surprised I haven't seen anyone complaining about how Varys already knows about LF's plan, which makes the whole thing a little more wack to me because it makes LF look more strategically-incompetent than the character is supposed to me. Your idea would still make LF look like the genius in the end, which I think is important. I hope they go a similar route on the show, which I actually think they will because of the fact that right now it seems like LF is being bested... probably just setting us up for a double-twist

4005	Elba the Intoner	2013-04-22	I actually just posted about this in the nitpick without repercussion thread.  I think you are right that this is the way they are going with the story.  However, it still has some big problems doing it this way IMHO.  That's because now, not only do Varys and Ros know how interested LF is in Sansa, but so does Olenna.  I just find it really hard to believe that none of these characters will have any idea where Sansa might have disappeared to after the purple wedding.  Olenna and Varys are not stupid and especially given Varys' own comment that LF is the most dangerous man in Westeros or whatever it was, I find it hard to believe that they won't suspect that LF got her after all, especially when word starts to get around that LF's long lost daughter has turned up with him at the Eyrie at about the same time that Sansa disappeared.  I guess we'll have to see how this all plays out on the show.
4006	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	Why would ros help out after the pw and not inform varys, when she told him everything before?
4007	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	Why would ros help out after the pw and not inform varys, when she told him everything before?I'm assuming Varys would tell her to continue spying on LF, and do whatever Baelish tells her to do. She goes along with it, and helps Sansa escape, as commanded by Littlefinger, only to end up getting killed, rather than returning to KL.
4008	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	I'm assuming Varys would tell her to continue spying on LF, and do whatever Baelish tells her to do. She goes along with it, and helps Sansa escape, as commanded by Littlefinger, only to end up getting killed, rather than returning to KL.So varys will know his plans again?  I hate it TBH.
4009	Alboin	2013-04-22	Ros playing Dontos role in Sansa's fate is actually good idea.
4010	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	It's never actually confirmed in the books whether Varys is aware of LF's involvement in the Purple Wedding. I don't think it's out of the question, considering that it only benefits Varys' purposes.
4011	Dethzilla	2013-04-22	I think Tywin (at Sersie's suggestion) will order Tyrion to marry Sansa which not only unfoils Littlefinger's plot but also Vary's and the Tyrell's plot to secure the claim to the Northern Throne.

And I think it will. Very nice catch.
4013	victim	2013-04-22	I'm just glad Ros finally has a role other than the Tits. 
I don't think she'll be the Dontos. It's pretty clear she mislikes Littlefinger quite a lot and probably wouldn't deliver Sansa too him.
4014	The Unborn	2013-04-22	Well me, I like to think that the other place Littlefinger reserved on the boat is not for Sansa. Maybe he will take Ros with him, and kill her because he knows she spies on him for Varys. Or something else...
4015	KoishNoish	2013-04-22	Should the plot play out like this I think it will work will with one exception. Right now we know that Varys, Ros and Olenna all know of Littlefinger's interest with Sansa. So if she should disappear off the face of the Earth and Littlefinger should suddenly get a daughter then surely Varys and Olenna will notice. I suppose if Sansa is disguised as a maid it would work but I'd prefer it to stay loyal to the books in this respect. Surely the writers can see the flaw here can't they? How are they going to patch it up?
4016	Mediumjon Umber	2013-04-22	I think I read somewhere that D&D aren't quite finished with Dontos yet (I could be absolutely wrong though), but I can't provide any links so this is a shot in the dark.
Anyway, I think Dontos might have a bigger role in S4 up until the PW, as there won't be much going on in KL in s4 so dragging out the wedding and Sansa's escape might be a good idea. As for Ros... substituting that lady friend Cersei had in aFfC with Ros would be an abomination, but I don't see it as totally impossible seeing as how Ros is moving up in the world and Cersei slowly begins her degeneration into a paranoid drunk.
4017	Kasrith	2013-04-22	I like this, and have been thinking along the same lines.. The preview of the next ep also fortifies this for me, as we see Sansa watching a ship sailing off. Most likely LFhttp://www.youtube.c...h?v=SoemaxLkgRQ
4018	Iotun	2013-04-22	Not totally related, but I think this is more evidence that seals the PW being in Season 3. So far we have two big plot points mentioned in pretty much every episode - Joffrey's marriage - and the rivalry regarding what will happen to Sansa, and whether she will be won by the Tyrells, Lannisters or Littlefinger. Both of these plots end at the PW, and it seems clumsy to introduce them now and give them so much significance but not end them. If the PW was in Season 4, I think the show would not have shown Littlefinger being behind a third attempt to control Sansa and kept that as a Season 4 surprise, so that her arc in Season 3 involves only the Lannister/Tyrrel proposals, and ends with her marrying Tyrion. The fact that Littlefinger has already been introduced as part of that plot indicates that the plot has to end with his own involvement.

I don't think it's out of the question, considering that it only benefits Varys' purposes.Not necessarily.  Varys has much more control of Sansa when he can keep an eye on her.  As long as in your scenario, there's an explanation of why she didnt sell out Sansa the second time, I wont go beserk.  Nothing is confirmed in the book, a lot is left unsaid but I think its widely considered that LF pulled the coup off masterfully.  Varys at least feigns ignorance.
4020	Rapsie	2013-04-22	I'm not really what they are doing with the Sansa / LF plot. It really is now too well known around KL. To be honest I think they are mucking up her storyline quite alot, but then D&D know the ending, so maybe they are doing stuff that will tie in with later books.
4021	Red Knight	2013-04-22	directors better be careeful as they're on the slippery ice with this
4022	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	directors better be careeful as they're on the slippery ice with thisEven though LF has been nowhere near the player he is inthe books, all they need is Varys to say he's dangerous in one scene and all is forgiven.

After Joffrey's killed, she isn't important to the QOT and she doesn't appear to be very meaningful to Varys' plots.They don't ever say they have any idea where she is, but who is to say they are even looking? It's better for the QOT if she just disappears anyway.

She's accused, along with Tyrion, of killing the king. If she's ever found in King's Landing, she'll be sent to join her father.Her and Tyrion disappearing is great for the Tyrells because it makes them seem all the more guilty and there's no doubt to be cast on Maergary. Which is a big deal since she has already outlived 2 husbands and is on a 3rd.

Furthermore, we don't know the true intentions of Varys and the QoT from the books. LF even mentions to Sansa who killed Joffrey, so it is possible that LF conspired with them.

Cersei looses her power in AFfC, but while Tywin is alive she is still a threat, as the Tyrrel will provably find out in this season.

If they knew where Sansa was, she be invaluable stashed away in Highgarden.First off. Sansa's already been blamed at this point.Second. They don't hold the power in King's Landing at all. They have a tenuous hold on a future Queenship through Maerg, that relies on Tommen making it to an old enough age to rule. Tywin rules until then and if they should ever be suspected of having a hand in killing Joff, they'd get Tommen out of that arrangement quickly, not to mention have their heads.They aren't going to work to get Sansa's name cleared when they are (literally) getting away with murder.

They have a tenuous hold on a future Queenship through Maerg, that relies on Tommen making it to an old enough age to rule. Tywin rules until then and if they should ever be suspected of having a hand in killing Joff, they'd get Tommen out of that arrangement quickly, not to mention have their heads.They aren't going to work to get Sansa's name cleared when they are (literally) getting away with murder.Ok, we're speaking about different timelines, i think I confused things for all involved.Also at @raviepoint.I still contend Sansa's importance for all parties vying for power.  Especially Varys at this point considering his endgame.

4033	Hound's She-wolf	2013-04-22	Not really.  The Tyrells hold the power in KL, they know the truth behind the PW and they can blame everything on Tyrion.  If they knew where Sansa was, she be invaluable stashed away in Highgarden.Sansa is a huuuuge prize for ANYONE involved in the game of thrones, especially considering how tenuous Tommen's hold on the throne is right now.I think only certain Tyrells know she was not involved, I don't know that all the Tyrells were involved in the plot-Mace seems to be convinced she is guilty.But yes, even being accused of regicide, I can't imagine the Tyrells wouldn't want to get their hands on her.
4034	Hound's She-wolf	2013-04-22	I hope that this is a LF scheme, because otherwise he doesn't seem like much of a mastermind. We know that Varys, Ros and Olenna know, more than likely Maergary knows- if she is all of a sudden trying to fix Sansa up with her gay brother, she has to know something is happening.
I just can't come up with an idea about how this is actually a multilayered plot to discredit Varys. No matter when or how it happens, if Sansa disappears from Kings Landing, at least two powerful people know to look right at LF.
4035	Hound's She-wolf	2013-04-22	I hope that this is a LF scheme, because otherwise he doesn't seem like much of a mastermind, and I'll be disappointed in him. We know that Varys, Ros and Olenna know, more than likely Margaery knows- if she is all of a sudden trying to fix Sansa up with her gay brother, she has to know something is happening.I just can't come up with an idea about how this is actually a multilayered plot to discredit Varys. No matter when or how it happens, if Sansa disappears from Kings Landing, at least two powerful people know to look right at LF.
4036	shiola	2013-04-22	I think Tywin (at Sersie's suggestion) will order Tyrion to marry Sansa which not only unfoils Littlefinger's plot but also Vary's and the Tyrell's plot to secure the claim to the Northern Throne.Which is exactly why it happened in the books, yes.
4037	wandering	2013-04-22	I like this. I wasn't that bothered(but still a little) by them revealing that Littlefinger is openly helping Sansa, but I'm surprised I haven't seen anyone complaining about how Varys already knows about LF's plan, which makes the whole thing a little more wack to me because it makes LF look more strategically-incompetent than the character is supposed to me. Your idea would still make LF look like the genius in the end, which I think is important. I hope they go a similar route on the show, which I actually think they will because of the fact that right now it seems like LF is being bested... probably just setting us up for a double-twist Well said sir.
4038	therustman	2013-04-22	I agree that the arc will end up making Littlefinger look as 'dangerous' as Varys claims. Especially if Ros does replace Dontos and that's an additional reason Littlefinger kills her.
4039	Elba the Intoner	2013-04-22	Since we don't have any Queen of Thorns or Varys POV in the books, how do we know that neither of them have their own suspicions on where Sansa is? After Joffrey's killed, she isn't important to the QOT and she doesn't appear to be very meaningful to Varys' plots.They don't ever say they have any idea where she is, but who is to say they are even looking? It's better for the QOT if she just disappears anyway.It is mentioned a couple of times that Varys has been looking for her.  Ser Shadrich is looking for her because Varys has offered reward money to anyone who finds her and he wants the money.  That's just one example but it was mentioned in a couple of other places that Varys has been looking for her and can't find her.  Now you're right that this could all just be Varys pulling the wool over everyone's eyes and he knows exactly where she is because we don't have his POV to know what he really is thinking, but I found this highly doubtful.  His value to that Lannisters is to give them information.  Wouldn't it make him look greatly invaluable to them to reveal to them where Sansa is if he knew?  And if he wants to get LF out of the way or make him look bad because he's afraid of how dangerous he is, revealing to Tywin that LF has Sansa would be the way to do it.  That would put Tywin and Cersei on notice that LF is not their friend and is not working for their purposes as they now believe.  Plus, the whole point of the scene on the show is that Varys does not want LF getting his hands on Sansa who is the key to the North for sure by the time of the purple wedding because that has the potential to make him even more powerful.  Thatls why he goes to Olenna in the first place.  So, why wouldn't he say something if he knew? As for Olenna, at the purple wedding she made the offer once again to Sansa to come to Highgarden with her afterward.  She was definitely interested in Sansa for her claim even at that point, in fact, more so since as I said above, by that time Robb was indeed dead and Sansa would have the claim to the North.  What we are saying play out on the show is that it is making it glaringly obvious that the Tyrells are power hungry and making their power grab in every way possible.  Getting Sansa who has the claim to the entire North would do that for them so I don't believe that Sansa no longer has any value to Olenna.
4040	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	I agree that the arc will end up making Littlefinger look as 'dangerous' as Varys claims. Especially if Ros does replace Dontos and that's an additional reason Littlefinger kills her.Except that doesnt make sense.  If she us Dontos, then everyone will know who has sansa.
4041	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	I just can't come up with an idea about how this is actually a multilayered plot to discredit Varys. No matter when or how it happens, if Sansa disappears from Kings Landing, at least two powerful people know to look right at LF.Good point.
4042	juanml82	2013-04-22	Should the plot play out like this I think it will work will with one exception. Right now we know that Varys, Ros and Olenna all know of Littlefinger's interest with Sansa. So if she should disappear off the face of the Earth and Littlefinger should suddenly get a daughter then surely Varys and Olenna will notice. I suppose if Sansa is disguised as a maid it would work but I'd prefer it to stay loyal to the books in this respect. Surely the writers can see the flaw here can't they? How are they going to patch it up?LF realizes Ross is informing VarysLF ships Ross to Ramsay as fake Sansa - everyone believes the Boltons got SansaRoss spills the beans to RamsayThe Boltons plan to attack the Vale once they consolidate their power in the NorthLF plans to reveal Sansa when that happen, causing the assembled armies in the North realize the Boltons called them to fight to kill Ned's little girl. LF believes the Northerners will turn against the Boltons, securing the North for Sansa whom he believes will be his puppet.It won't work due Stannis, but LF can't know that.Or something completely different.

They'd have to return and Sansa to KL for justice.
4044	chris999	2013-04-22	I lerned a lot about what I think will be the future of the series in this episode.
I remember a lot of us thinking that Littlefinger was going to marry Sansa off to the unlikely Arryn heir, (is his name Harry or Henry?) or maybe even to Little Robin.
I guess we didnt think that GRRM would go there with Littlefinger marrying Sansa himself... But, it does set up for a nice princess rescue in one of the upcoming books though.
Also another thing about LF I have always kind of suspected that he was smarter and more dangerous than people were giving him credit for, but when Varys says that "Littlefinger would burn the country for a chance to rule over the ashes"... makes me think that these next few books are going to be out of this world.

4045	Frey Pie a la Mode	2013-04-22	I never understood the whole "no one knows where Sansa has gone!" Wouldn't Varys have birds in the Eyrie? Wouldn't someone tell someone that LF suddenly showed up with a natural daughter (who knew he'd even been with a woman anyway?) who just happens to look exactly like Sansa with differently colored hair?
4046	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-04-22	You're assuming everyone knows what Sansa Stark looks like.  This isn't 21st century Earth, there are no photographs, nobody who has actually met her before would know her.
4047	SerMixalot	2013-04-22	Cersei doesnt hold much power at all anymore, if any.but she will bounce back, likely with the faith behind her, that is my prediction
4048	juanml82	2013-04-22	Boltons are working with the Lannisters, Lannisters are accusing her of killing Joff.   They'd have to return and Sansa to KL for justice.Unless Sansa isn't framed for Joffrey's death in the show
4049	Mulled Wino	2013-04-22	but she will bounce back, likely with the faith behind her, that is my predictionQuite the prediction, ser.  Would take a hell of a turnaround and political deftness we havent seen from her yet.
4050	Hound's She-wolf	2013-04-22	Quite the prediction, ser.  Would take a hell of a turnaround and political deftness we havent seen from her yet. Forget the Faith, the High Sparrow doesn't trust her, she's going to have to get the Kitten King to grant her power. I'm voting that Tommen makes her Hand of the King.
4051	Butterknife	2013-04-22	This has really been the WORST part of the series so far for me, aside from them massacring Catelyn's storyline. They are destroying any of the intrigue and surprise involved around Littlefinger and Sansa. We're already given the plot from the very start, and they're both being made out to be absolute morons.. I don't think they're doing enough to show the suffering Sansa is in at this point either. I guess we'll see her heckled quite a lot once the Tyrion marriage takes place..
I do hope your theory ends up being at least partially true, with the plot being found out but failing initially.. They need to show the viewers what a master Littlefinger is.. His cunning rivals Varys but is sold as being at a very low level in the show. If they can pull off the plot in a believable and surprising way, I'll be very very happy. Sansa is my favourite character, and this is a major arc in her storyline. You need to feel the necessity for her to escape.. Just disappointed so far /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />.

They tell (trough Varys) that LF is very dangerous however in series he tells everyone his plans and even a whore like Ros can figure out what is he up to! It is ridiculous. I doubt even Varys knew in the books that LF had Sansa as LF knows that Varys is closely watching him so he cannot allow any missteps and Varys would do much to stop LF gaining more power, so if Varys knew about Sansa he would act accordingly.

4055	Joyful Union	2013-04-23	but she will bounce back, likely with the faith behind her, that is my predictionI reckon she's going to bounce back by using her invincible undead goliath to massacre the Tyrells.
4056	Hound's She-wolf	2013-04-23	Mace is already there, he'd basically hAve to die. That can be arranged....And I blocked the chair out of my mind, but now that you bring it up...I'm still snickering at the thought of a giant hand chair.
4057	LÂ<U+0092>Age dÂ<U+0092>or	2013-04-23	I think it was a nice touch, especially since Tyrion was present in the scene as well, considering he is gonna be probably smuggled in one of those overseas in the show. D&D have a lot of criticizers in here but honestly for every modification they make to the story that we don't like, they come up with a lot more positive additions.
4058	Cyphmos	2013-04-22	I need to rewatch the episode but i thought i saw him get hit with something in Craster's. 
Am I wrong? Do you think he is ok?
4059	Nezzer	2013-04-22	He is. He actually killed a man.
4060	Mediumjon Umber	2013-04-22	From the looks of it he got grabbed from behind, but managed to stab the guy holding him. It does look like he stabs himself though, but the grunt we hear following the stabbing doesn't really fit Edd's expression in that scene. 
I'm positive he and Grenn are okay.
4061	Cyphmos	2013-04-22	Good. Edd is awesome.
4062	Roose Seal	2013-04-22	Edd is alive and for that very reason he will never be ok.
4063	Iotun	2013-04-22	I don't see a reason to kill him off. Brings some comic relief on the one hand, and on the other hand killing him won't be seen as a dramatic plot point so won't really be impactful. Only way I think he will dies is if there's an actor scheduling issue (as I understand it, pretty much what happened to Rakharro)..

Ooo and Grenn is a beast, he charged that guy like an angry bull.
4081	Ser Edmure Tully	2013-04-22	Is it bad that I actually admired burn gormans character in that scene? "You are a bastard... A daughter fucking, wildling, bastard" he might be a prick, but he ain't a coward. 
Hats off to the guy who played craster as well.
4082	The Anti-Targ	2013-04-22	They better not kill off Edd and Grenn. I want to see the Edd, Grenn and Pyp show back at Castle black.
Given it was Rast who killed Mormont, does that mean Burn Gorman's character could be classed as not a mutineer and thus return to the Wall and not be condemned to death? He only killed Craster, after Craster attacked him, which is a) only killing a wildling and b ) self defence. Absolutely nothing punishable about that. It seems odd to have a known person play a 2 scene character, better if he came back to the wall and became part of the Thorne/Slynt faction.
4083	Head of The Ned	2013-04-22	Yeah I would hope that he didn't end up dying I quite liked that dude. At first I thought "maybe this is Bowen Marsh" but I guess he's just some random NW. Would be nice to have him stick around.

4089	LeananKite	2013-04-22	What about Samwell slaying a white walker with the dragon glass?
Will they cut this out?
I think it is an important character development for Sam and a hint about how to fight the white walkers as well.
Do you think this scene is still to come?
4090	scurvy	2013-04-22	Mayhaps Edd and a couple other loyal Brothers catch up with Samwell just as the White Walker arrives because it smells Gilly's Little Monster.  To protect the babe, Sam becomes the Slayer with his dragonglass dagger.
4091	Vany Targaryen	2013-04-22	I think that white walkers will attack Sam and Gilly, as in the books, but instead of introducing Cooldhands now, Sam will save themselves....that's the only way Sam could still become the slayer, and perhaps it is too early for them to introduce Cooldhands yet, so they moved him somewhere in the future. Hope i'm making any sense
4092	Damar	2013-04-22	I could see Rast and Burn Gorman going after Sam, be killed by the White Walker and than Sam killing it with the dragonglass dagger.
4093	Mediumjon Umber	2013-04-22	Sam the Slayer must happen this season. They've already made him a much larger wimp than he was in the books and now he needs some redemption.
4094	kephv	2013-04-22	Mayhaps Edd and a couple other loyal Brothers catch up with Samwell just as the White Walker arrives because it smells Gilly's Little Monster.  To protect the babe, Sam becomes the Slayer with his dragonglass dagger.They better. I mean, without people there to witness his badassery he can't very well be called the Slayer.

4096	Crown	2013-04-22	Are we are getting Coldhands? I saw a preview that looked like the raven scene.Yeah, I reckon we'll get Coldhands in episode 6.
4097	Mark Antony	2013-04-22	Kinda pissed they changed Sam the Slayer, I loved how the whole Nights Watch started calling him that.
4098	Jabronius Maximus	2013-04-22	Sam already appeared to be taking control of things during his escape, so the WW thing can't be far away, likely when they get attacked on the way to Whitetree or whatever village he wanted to go to. They have to have the Slayer bit in there, it's such a huge part of Sam's story. Then again they've already delayed it quite a bit, which has me worried...EDIT: Just found an article where John Bradley basically confirms it'll happen, says it's 'worth the wait' (Bradley is the guy who plays Sam)http://www.scifinow....sam-the-slayer/

What episode will it happen in?
4100	Reposado	2013-04-22	they could also dispense with cold hands altogether.
now that weve read book 5, its clear his role was not integral.
sam can get back to the wall the regular way.
bran can find his way past the wall and to the children by following the crow, or jojen or dreams
4101	Vague04	2013-04-22	Even I. The books Sam doesn't slay the other until after the crashes keep stuff happens and he escapes with Gilly. It should happen very soon but I don't know f it is important whether anyone sees him do it gang him the nickname. The important partis learning how to kill others.
4102	lostinwesteros	2013-04-22	@ Sgt Rex Powell Colt - Thanks for the link.If we don't get to see Coldhands, I will cry bawl.    /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' />
4103	ShigellaSand	2013-04-23	They could have Gilly the only witness and still put the nickname in there. Either she starts calling him that, or she later tells the NW the story when they return to Castle Black, and the others use the name, half mocking half believing.
4104	ChozenOne	2013-04-23	I bet Grenn and Edd catch up to Sam. He is a pretty fat and he has a girl and a baby with him slowing him down even more. As the are retreating to the wall they run into Rast and Burn Gorman. Sam finally grows a pair, pulls the dragon glass dagger, and stands between them and Gilly after they say they're gonna rape her, the little monster starts crying, and right as they are about to cut Sam down the White Walker will come out behind them. Sam, Grenn, Edd and Gilly all piss themselves, while Gorman and Rast turn around to fight the WW and promptly die. The WW will walk towards Gilly to retrieve his sacrifce from Craster, Sam will be between them, still holding the dagger, and he'll close his eyes and shove it ito the WW, and he goes all wicked witch.
I also think Rast will get a second attempt to to slit piggy's throat like he said he was gonna, this time as a wight, after Sam and Gilly get seperated from Grenn and Edd durring a storm, but this time Coldhands will come to the rescue on his elk with his murder of crows! it will be awesome!
I think Grenn was the only one to see Sam the Slayer in the book, so I guess Gilly could be the only witness as well, like ShigellaSand said.

4107	PatchfaceTheFool	2013-04-22	Since GRRM consults on the shows, I guess we can assume that anything added to the show that are not in the books will not contradict the overall plot of the series. (For example, for those who were skeptical of whether Varys really was a eunuch, we know that yes he really is, from the episode where Ros tried to grab his junk and realized there was nothing there.)So Varys' scene with Tyrion in this episode was really interesting to me, because it tells a couple of things: we see Varys having the sorcerer who cut him captured and delivered to him. (I'm pretty sure that sorcerer will never be seen or heard of again.)So now we know	a)Varys really was cut against his will.	b)The sorcerer wasn't Marwyn, as some theories suspected, or anyone else that we are gonna meet later in the books. Basically, he's not important to the plot.In the books, from the conversation Arya overhears between Varys and Illyrio, we get the impression that Varys' "little birds" have their tongues cut. So Varys hates the sorcerer for mutilating him and throwing him out to die, and yet he is involved in the mutilation and slavery of hundreds of children himself. This tells us that Varys isn't operating out of some sense of altruistic justice.I was also assuming that what the voice in the fire said during the ritual was somehow going to be important to discovering Varys' true goals (See here for theories) - though after this scene I'm not so sure.
4108	Pinkie Baelish	2013-04-22	Mods, please be extra kind and approve this thread.
From what I've seen so far this season, ep4 pretty much confirmed my suspicions on how they'll be handling Sansa's escape from LF, while still progressing with the whole Varys vs Littlefinger rivalry they're doing.
From what we've seen in episode 1, I'm assuming the show wants the viewer to believe that Littlefinger intends to take Sansa with him this season, when he departs for the Vale. And Varys putting an axe in his plans furthers the rivalry the two have. Since Varys suggested marrying Sansa to Loras, it makes sense within show canon, to have LF reveal this plot to the Lannisters, because not only does it fit into his agenda, but it further plays up his rivalry with Varys. LF then departs for the Vale after telling Tywin of the plot.
I believe the show runners want the viewers' hopes of Sansa leaving KL to be dashed after her wedding to Tyrion, even more so after the Red Wedding, since she will have no close family to return to. If the show goes with this, and sweeps Littlefinger under the rug up until the aftermath of the Purple Wedding, the show will still be able to contain the element of surprise when it's revealed that Littlefinger orchestrated Sansa's escape. Plus, changing the story a bit so that LF orchestrates the PW only after Varys messes up his plans stays true to the character, as it shows his ability to adapt and turn any disadvantage into an advantage. If Ros takes up the part of Dontos, and is killed by Baelish after helping Sansa escape, this also wraps up the rivalry between Baelish and Varys.
Thoughts?
4109	Pellaeon	2013-04-22	I think the viewers have already seen the creepy situation andd that LF lusts for Sansa, the lines of Varys and Ros only confirmed that. So I am sure the show runners want to build the escape up more like something to dread instead of  hope.Another stroke of fate against Sansa, they have shown that Littlefinger isn't her knight more like a second captor.I am also not sure if Loras is really Varys's and Olenna's plan: Is Loras really the plan?I think the show goes in a very different direction
4110	Lord Varys	2013-04-22	My guess is that Sansa will tell Littlefinger next week - perhaps due to Shae's advice -, when finally departs for the Vale, that he can go fuck himself with his vague promises, she doesn't need him anymore, because she now has Loras, LORAS! In a way that would mirror how the Tyrell plot was undone in the book as well. Sansa told Dontos about Willas, Dontos told Littlefinger, and Littlefinger told Tywin.
The real interesting thing will be how Littlefinger is going to end up being involved in the Tyrell plot to poison Joffrey. They should better not change that...
4111	dttljs123	2013-04-22	He isn't going to take Sansa at first because she will be married to Tyrion, after the PW Sansa will get snatched out of KL

4118	Juan_Snow	2013-04-15	Sansa and Loras??? Do you mean Willas?Someone on here pointed out last week that it works better for viewers if they use Loras in the show.  Nobody has any idea who Willas is and Sansa has had a crush on Loras since season 1.  It makes it much worse for Sansa when Tyrion is forced on her.
4119	oprahnoodlemantra	2013-04-15	Sansa and Loras??? Do you mean Willas?A lot of people expect it to be changed for the TV show.Also, the preview makes it pretty obvious that the Beric/Hound fight will be in episode 4. I was hoping to meet Beric earlier.

4124	Mediumjon Umber	2013-04-15	What I get from the episode title is that Mormont will be killed.Judging from this article: http://www.hollywood...lk-third-439307 the next episode is going to be one of the big ones. So, the sack of Astapor is going to be epic? I sure hope so!
4125	JMJ	2013-04-15	A lot of people expect it to be changed for the TV show.Also, the preview makes it pretty obvious that the Beric/Hound fight will be in episode 4. I was hoping to meet Beric earlier.We did - he was shown briefly in Season 1 when Ned as Hand of the King originally sent him off to serve justice to the Mountain. I'm sure we'll see lots of Un-Beric as he gets revived by Thoros etc.
4126	JMJ	2013-04-15	If The Hound vs. Beric takes place in episode 4, then what does 'The Hound is judged by the Gods' in the episode 5 synposis mean?Could just be that the Hound wins the trial by combat with Beric in E04, but he physically walks off in E05?
4127	MercyTheBlindUglyLittleCat	2013-04-15	1.) Dany takes Astapor (HUGE set-piece)
2.) Mormont is killed in the mutiny (big emotional moment)
3.) Sam saves Gily and her baby from WW (Sam the slayer)
4.) The Hound is presented to Beric (and Arya is witness)
5.) Theon gets to know "Reek", his friendly rescuer on the way to... Asha (Yara)
6.) Cersei warns her father of the Tyrells. Both families share a dinner with Sansa (Olenna lays down some veiled smack talk)
7.) Jamie deals with his new situation, and Brienne shows him sympathy
8.) Bran gets to better know Jojen and has more dreams.
4128	Joyful Union	2013-04-15	I have a feeling that Tywin will reveal his intention to marry Cersei off this episode
4129	Moseh Khayim	2013-04-15	The trial by combat between Beric and the Hound takes place in episode 5. In episode 4 Arya and the Hound will be escorted to Beric. Arya will accuse the Hound. Beric will grant the Hound trial by combat. We'll leave episode 4 with the impending clash.

4132	Brother Without Banners	2013-04-15	They'll probably end the episode with the Dracarys moment. That, or the mutiny at Crastors. HBO tends to end on cliffhangers, and I don't know that simply setting the stage for the Beric / Hound battle would qualify.

4134	Dysun	2013-04-15	The Hound wont fight Beric in this episode, it will be the next one "Kissed by Fire". I also doubt Sam the Slayer is in this episode, the mutiny and escape is what will occur. Sam the Slayer I imagine will come right before we are introduced to Coldhands later on and only Gilly will be there to see it happen.
4135	Mark Antony	2013-04-15	and only Gilly will be there to see it happen.Which sucks! I loved how the entire Nights Watch pretty much started calling him Sam the Slayer lool.
4136	Dysun	2013-04-15	I agree it should have happened in episode 2 on the trek back from the fist like the book, but oh well
4137	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-15	From what I hear Dracarys is the final scene and its totally awesome.

-Jon gets into an arguement with Orell about which side he's on.
-Tywin tells Tyrion he is to marry Sansa, he talks with Olenna.
-Beric allows The Hound trial by battle.
-Jaime struggles everyday life without his hand.
-Theon learns to trust Ramsay as they near Asha's newly taken land.

4143	Sansa in the North	2013-04-15	I can't wait to find out what that strange crowd scene with Joff and Marge is.Judging from this article: http://www.hollywood...lk-third-439307 the next episode is going to be one of the big ones. So, the sack of Astapor is going to be epic? I sure hope so!This says we haven't seen the last of Dontos. Interesting... Maybe he will be the one to betray Sansa's secret about the betrothal to the Lannisters.
4144	Paul Baratheon	2013-04-15	I think karstark will most likely kill the lannisters in this episode as well. Maybe his beheading included?
4145	Khal-a-bunga	2013-04-15	I think the scene between Varys and Olenna is about marrying Sansa to Loras. It's too early for Tywin to decree that Tyrion is marrying Sansa, anyway, seeing as their wedding won't be happening until the eight episode. This will cause Sansa to change her mind about leaving King's Landing with Littlefinger, and as such, he'll head to the Eyrie alone (it's known that Lysa and Robin will both appear this season). I figured a large part of the story line in King's Landing would center around Sansa, and it looks like that is the case. 
I'm also expecting to see the Lord Commander betrayed and killed, with Sam & Gilly escaping (possibly with Grenn & Edd, for a little while). Dany and the original 'Dracarys' scene from the book. Some more with Theon and not-Ramsay. I also think we'll see Arya and Bran, but probably no Stannis or Jon.
4146	Newstar	2013-04-15	I think the scene between Varys and Olenna is about marrying Sansa to Loras. It's too early for Tywin to decree that Tyrion is marrying Sansa, anyway, seeing as their wedding won't be happening until the eight episode.Yes, from what we know from the episode synopses, it looks like Tywin doesn't even come up with the Tyrion/Sansa marriage until 3x06, whose ep synopsis reads among other things "Tywin plans strategic unions."We don't know anything about the content of the Varys/Olenna conversation other than a line from one of the trailers from that scene, something along the lines of "He would burn all of Westeros to be king of the ashes," which doesn't sound like a reference to a Sansa/Loras match. Sansa/Loras could presumably be discussed in the same scene, of course.The Loras/Sansa match is going to have to be brought up pretty quickly, though, if Tywin is already plotting the Tyrion/Sansa marriage in response in 3x06. Sansa isn't mentioned at all in the 3x04 episode synopsis and there's no footage of her in the episode promo, but that subject will have to be broached fairly soon.This will cause Sansa to change her mind about leaving King's Landing with Littlefinger, and as such, he'll head to the Eyrie alone (it's known that Lysa and Robin will both appear this season). I figured a large part of the story line in King's Landing would center around Sansa, and it looks like that is the case.Yeah, on IMDB (for whatever it's worth), the actors for Lysa and Robin are listed for 3x07, suggesting that Littlefinger is at the Eyrie by then. I'm a bit fuzzy on the timing of Littlefinger's departure from KL, though, especially if he's the one who's going to leak the news of the Loras/Sansa marriage plot to Tywin. If he is going to be the one who blows the whistle, he has to stick around long enough for the plan to be formed and for Sansa to blab about it. The fact that Episode 6 is titled "The Climb" and Littlefinger, as we know, has a big monologue about the climb being all there is taken from the show makes me wonder if Littlefinger is still in KL by Episode 6. ("The Climb" refers to the climb over the Wall, but it might be a reference to both.) The timing's a bit fuzzy, at any rate.Aidan Gillen did an interview not too longer ago stating that (spoilers for the show)
	Spoiler Littlefinger gets a ship in Season 4.
That could mean that Littlefinger leaves for the Eyrie and doesn't return for the remainder of Season 3.
4147	Keishi of Oldstones	2013-04-15	Melisandre coming to the brotherhood because of her fires to sacrifice Gendry for his kings blood or at the very least taking him back to DragonStone.

I feel like it wil be either this episode or the next.I'm hoping he at least goes back to Dragonstone so he can tie in with Davos later on (if the show gets to that point)Not sure that'll be in episode 4 though as it's a long trip & a more minor subplot.

Mel couldn't get there that fast to bring about this Gendry=Edric twist so fast....unless she stole Littlefinger's private jet from last season. lol.  Besides I want to meet Selyse and Shireen at some point.  I have a feeling Arya's last scene will be the judgement call to have the trial by combat.  They couldn't have Beric's resurrection in any other episode other than one called "Kissed by Fire" (I know everyone's anticipating Jon's *ahem* activities, but this will be far more entertaining IMO)  Also, I really want them to do the Acorn Hall scene, because it's adorable, but I have a feeling that's too much lightheartedness for HBO after the Hot Pie farewell /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />I think Lady Olenna will talk to Sansa about Loras, but Cersei will figure out what's going on and plot with Tywin to have Tyrion marry her.Craster's is going to be so sad....I'm already dreading it!Kraznyz (spell?) is going to get his! muahaha! lol.  I really hope they didn't hold back.Jon and Ygritte's relationship I think will start budding I think...and for goodness sake I hope we see Tormund's funny side come through at some point.Jaimie and Brienne get to Harrenhall...Jaimie sad time.Robb...yeah i don't really care what Robb's doing at the moment so I doubt we'll see more than a clip or two..hopefully a Frey discussion or something?I hope we start seeing some glimpses of Ramsay's F'd-up-ness, but they've got a whole season to play this how they want to so I dunno.Bran, I'm actually really interested to hear some Jojen stories: history, warging, and green-seeing.I doubt we'll see all of them, but here's hoping!
4150	Montey14	2013-04-15	but Loras isSomeone on here pointed out last week that it works better for viewers if they use Loras in the show.  Nobody has any idea who Willas is and Sansa has had a crush on Loras since season 1.  It makes it much worse for Sansa when Tyrion is forced on her.But Loras is kingsguard.....he can't be betrothed to Sansa
4151	Lord Jakkor	2013-04-15	but Loras isBut Loras is kingsguard.....he can't be betrothed to SansaI don't believe he's joined the King's Guard yet in the show. They haven't mentioned it, and he's not wearing the white cloak. This is probably a huge reason for the delay, so that he can be "betrothed" to Sansa. When she marries Tyrion I think he'll join the King's Guard, giving some BS reason about lost love as a reason. Publicly he'll speak of Sansa, but privately he's joining because of Renly.
4152	iheartseverus	2013-04-15	Loras is not yet in the Kingsguard--a common speculation is that Tywin will order Joff to order Loras into the Guard to keep him from marrying Sansa (or anyone else who might become a threat to the Lannisters).
I just want to say that the actor who's playing Krazyns is--wonderful!  The character is despicable, of course, but the actor is just great.  The flare of hunger and greed in his eyes when Dany mentions the dragons is perfectly done, and his whole body language changes in an instant, his eyes glitter, he leans slightly forward, his nostrils flare, his body tenses--its almost like he's about to spring forward, so eager is he.  Kudos to whoever that actor is--sorry he's gonna become a toaster pastry next week.  I would have enjoyed seeing more of him.

So, the sack of Astapor is going to be epic? I sure hope so!I hope so too. I must say, I didn't think it was that big of scene in the book though.  Not compared to the RW. Also,the interview also gives a little input on future show changes.  D&D allude that 
	Spoiler Ser Dontos will be 'seen in future episodes' even though the Ser Dontos arc from the books seems to have been edited out.

4164	King Tommen	2013-04-16	The Hound (along with Arya and Gendry) will meet Beric but they won't have their duel until the next episode.  The quick shot in the trailer of Gendry getting a hood pulled off his head is probably how he and Arya will be led into the secret BwB cave so they don't know where it really is.
There's a quick shot in the preview of Tyrion and Varys looking down into something which is kind of intriguing (I always thought it was Varys showing Tyrion one of the secret passages that he'll eventually end up using down the road).
It looks like the whole scene of Joffrey and Margaery presenting themselves to the general public from the Great Sept is in this episode with Olenna and Cersei having a dueling chat behind them.
I would imagine the Loras/Sansa betrothal plan is presented to Sansa this episode although I don't see any proof of this yet.
Dracarys obviously will occur (and will end off the episode).
The mutiny at Craster's (but not Sam slaying which will not happen for another couple episodes when he and Gilly are on the run back to the Wall).
Karstark killing the Lannister boys won't happen until E5 (the synopsis says Robb's betrayed) but we may see the seeds of discontent be sewn with him and Robb (as if that hasn't been done enough already)
Jaime and Brienne look to arrive at Harrenhal (or at least get a lot closer)
Not sure if there's any Jon at all this episode (maybe some flirting with Ygritte and some nasty exchanges with Orell since Orell is the one who is going to be his antagonist)
Not sure if Bran and co are in this episode either (they aren't in the preview).
Pretty sure no Stannis/Davos and Mel.
Based on what someone who has seen this episode has said, I can say what happens with Theon this episode for those who want to know. I'll put it in spoilers for those who don't want to know:
	Spoiler  The boy leads Theon to a secret hideout/passageway which he says will get him back to Yara.  On the way, he asks what really happened to Bran and Rickon at Winterfell and Theon tells him.  This is obviously the whole reason for the escape, so that the boy could gain Theon's trust and get this information. It ends up that Theon is led right back into the dungeon he escaped from and it is shown that the boy is in league with his captors.  I believe that it is still made unclear that the boy is Ramsay and that he's the ringleader.  It makes it look like he was just working alongside the other unnamed captors.  The Ramsay reveal will probably still be delayed until closer to the RW. Critics who have seen the 1st four episodes (who haven't read the books) are saying that it is still very (purposely) confusing after this as to what is going on with Theon.

4165	Jon Sn0w	2013-04-16	not sure if this was posted some where else, but just found it.  supposed to be scenes for next episode.    https://www.youtube....h?v=T0Dv9wL-rJQ
4166	JMJ	2013-04-16	There's a quick shot in the preview of Tyrion and Varys looking down into something which is kind of intriguing (I always thought it was Varys showing Tyrion one of the secret passages that he'll eventually end up using down the road).That makes sense. Would be a nice foreshadowing of Tyrion's future.Dracarys obviously will occur (and will end off the episode).I've been thinking that the producers are clearly limiting the appearance of the dragons as much as possible for budgetary reasons. The CGI must be quite expensive. Makes you wonder how they will handle the Meereen slavers' pit scene in ADWD.The mutiny at Craster's (but not Sam slaying which will not happen for another couple episodes when he and Gilly are on the run back to the Wall).If this is true, how will the show keep the key scene with LC Mormont talking to Sam about the dragonglass, keeping to the NW's true purpose, etc. Sam, or someone in the NW, has to learn more about dragonglass and the Others, and without it, a lot of the emotional impact of Mormont's death will be lost - the part where he dies realizing his last effort at ranging was for the wrong reason, and the Wildlings were not the true enemy.
4167	Aerys Blackfyre	2013-04-16	-mutiny at Craster's and the death of the Old Bear-Before Mormont dies he gives Sam his dying wish, that his son join the Watch (and then they will show Jorah)-Jojen is going to tell something very important to Bran, maybe something that's not in the books-Sam is going to kill the whight-Jaime and Brienne reach Harrenhall, Jaime is cured by Qyburn-Dany will have her army of unsullied (and her three dragons too, what a cheater!)
4168	KoishNoish	2013-04-16	Judging from the preview; Dany and her dragon scene, some Theon (hopefully Ramsay unveiling), Cersei getting pissed with Tyrells and Tywin /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />, Beric, Craster's and bit of Tyrion
4169	Hound Dog	2013-04-16	I saw them on IGN, WinterIsComing and this forum. I'll try to look for a source if I have some spare time later today. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Thank you, I think I'd like to check that out in the future. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

	Spoiler  I read an interesting piece from the creators of the dragons, the CGI folks.  They used videos of 'angry swans' to get the wing movements and head/neck thrusting correct.

Thanks for the reference. Makes sense - the show has not as of yet differentiated the three dragons much at this point. They need to "catch up" with how the books gave us a sense of individuality with the dragons.

4174	WheelofIceandFire	2013-04-16	Am i the only one disappointed in the amount of Arya we have had so far this season? I know there has only been three episodes but her arc in the third book was my favourite along with Jaime's so i was hoping she would be featured heavily. And it looks like she might not feature much for the rest of the season. I hope she isnt just used as a background character during the scenes with the Hound and the Brotherhood and (although i like Joe Dempsie and would like to see him remain in future seasons) i hope that Gendry doesnt have more screen time when he meets Mel than Arya once she has left the brotherhood. (and i kind of feel the same about Theon, i love the character and Alfie Allen but dont think it would be right if he had more screen time this season than Arya)
She isnt mentioned in any synopsis after episode 5 but i hope that doesnt mean that we wont be seeing her in each episode

I have complete confidence in D&D's ability to do the RW justice, given that it was that event which influenced them to create the show. One of the most devastating aspects, to me at least, of the RW was that Arya got so close to reuniting with her pack and fell short just outside of the massacre. The scenes with her and the hound should provide good television too

The scenes with her and the hound should provide good television tooI really hope they do feature her at the RW, but that is what i was worried about. I dont know why but i was wondering if they would just forget about her after the trial and has her disapear for the rest of the season once the Hound has taken her. But now that i think about it, they cant have a main character miss half of the season so she will probably be featured with the Hound travelling to the Twins.(And they need to include a scene where they find out that Edmure is getting married otherwise there would be no reason for the Hound to decide to take her there)And ive said it before, but i want the RW episode to end with Arya getting knocked out by the Hound just to make it look like another Stark is dead
4177	Joyful Union	2013-04-16	And ive said it before, but i want the RW episode to end with Arya getting knocked out by the Hound just to make it look like another Stark is deadFuuuck, I cant even imagine the shitstorm the show will be in for if non-bookreaders think Arya is dead too.
4178	mystikherb	2013-04-16	Fuuuck, I cant even imagine the shitstorm the show will be in for if non-bookreaders think Arya is dead too.Yeah, it'd be a week of agony for those non-readers who don't break down and google spoilers about Arya.

I cant really see any other possible ending for the episode. I dont think it will end with Robb and Catelyn dying because they would still need to show Arya attempting to get to them (unless they decide to end with the deaths of Robb and Cat and open the next episode with Arya but i think it will be better if she appears in the actual episode and they have the final episode as fallout instead of going straight back to the RW)
4180	oierem	2013-04-16	Featured:
KL
Arya
Jaime
Dany
Sam/NW
Theon
Bran
Not featured:
Jon
Robb/Cat
Dragonstone
Although it was reported that Iceland would be appearing in every episode from 1 to 5.
4181	shiola	2013-04-16	Yesss, more Reeds please.
4182	Breaking Bronn	2013-04-17	In KL, Joff/Marg scene in sept. Cersei speaks with Olenna, Tywin. Varys with Olenna, Tyrion. Possibly Tyrell proposal for Sansa.
Some Jaime stuff (probably arrival at Harrenhal). Cauterization will be in the next episode.
Theon/Boy shenanigans that end in Boy's betrayal.
Arya and the BWB reach Beric, and the Hound is granted trial by combat. Fight is in the following ep.
Some Bran stuff, because it shows a dream in the last second of the preview. More traveling and exposition, I bet.
Some Jon filler, in which Lord Snow interacts with Orell, Tormund and Ygritte. I doubt we see Mance anymore this season.
Mutiny at Craster's / Sam escapes with Gilly.
Dracarys.
No Dragonstone or Riverrun.
4183	GeorgeIAF	2013-04-17	Poor Jeor, it will be a sad episode this one, but i think the end will be awesome, with Dany shouting dracarys.
Also, am i the only one who wants this episode to finish very fast because of the reviews which covered the first 4 episodes ? From episode 5 we will be in for much more surprises.
4184	Raven's Teeth	2013-04-17	She will almost certainly play a pivotal role past episode 5 considering we need to see her travel with the Hound to The Twins, nearly reconnect with Cat/Robb, and fall just short once again.

The scenes with her and the hound should provide good television tooAbsolutely, I hope they get this right in the show, capturing properly the tragedy of that moment.  Also one of the qualities of this section in the book is The Hound's reaction.
4185	Rhasgul	2013-04-17	I am honestly fond of the Tyrell-Lannister clash so I can't wait for more planning and schemes!
4186	Khal Vader	2013-04-17	No brainers:
NW mutiny
Dondarrion introduced and the Hound accused.
Ramsay further gaining Theon's trust
Olenna vs. Cercei
Dracarys
Nonsensical boobie scene just to piss off people who didn't like last week's foursome.
My other guesses:
Jon is attacked by Forell's eagle
Tyrion recieves and "Handy" package
Brienne attempts an escape
Tyrells propose a Stark/Tyrell wedding
Lannister boys killed (no beaheading just yet)
4187	Winterz	2013-04-17	Someone on here pointed out last week that it works better for viewers if they use Loras in the show.  Nobody has any idea who Willas is and Sansa has had a crush on Loras since season 1.  It makes it much worse for Sansa when Tyrion is forced on her.I understand the reasons but that's still unfortunate. Loras already replaced Garlan and now replacing Willas makes it look like the Tyrell children are only Loras and Marge. However, since Willas doesn't make an appearance for said betrothal (or does he?) they can still make it happen. Just like Tyrion used "the youngest Martell" or something. Sansa could then seek a frienship with Loras and ask him how his brother was.
4188	dolphlundgren	2013-04-17	Not necessarily all in this next episode, but:
I think the Sansa/Loras betrothal will go down as follows:
Lady Olenna and Margaery tell the plan to Sansa
Lady Olenna confides in Varys to plan getting Sansa out of KL
Sansa confides in Littlefingerto let him know she's going to Highgarden instead of the Eyrie
In the next episode, Tywin announces Sansa will be married to Tyrion and Loras is named to the Kingsguard, leaving the audience to speculate whether it was Littlefinger or Varys that tipped off the Lannisters.
I was actually thinking the Dracarys moment happens in Ep. 5, since it seems to fit "Kissed by Fire".
Looking forward to Arya and the Hound scenes later in the season. I just finished rereading the chapter in SoS where he captures her, and they have a great dynamic. Unlike Sansa, Arya is not afraid to look at his face and tell him she wants to kill him. I think this will translate very well to the screen, especially with the great job Maisie Williams has been doing. No way they cut that interaction.
4189	Ravi Seaworth	2013-04-17	I was actually thinking the Dracarys moment happens in Ep. 5, since it seems to fit "Kissed by Fire".That title might refer to Ygritte. The teaser clearly points to the Dracarys moment in episode 4, since splitting the transaction with the dragons between two episodes would not be appropriate.
4190	dolphlundgren	2013-04-17	That title might refer to Ygritte. The teaser clearly points to the Dracarys moment in episode 4, since splitting the transaction with the dragons between two episodes would not be appropriate.I agree that they can't split up the Dragon transaction, nor can they really delay it any further, unless they chose to completely skip Dany this week.Kissed by Fire I think refers to both Ygritte's hair, and Beric being brought back to life. Reading the episode titles a few weeks ago I thought it would include dragonfire as well but that appears not to be the case.
4191	King Tommen	2013-04-17	I understand the reasons but that's still unfortunate. Loras already replaced Garlan and now replacing Willas makes it look like the Tyrell children are only Loras and Marge.

Sansa could then seek a frienship with Loras and ask him how his brother was.Outside of "they were in the books" is there a good, solid reason why the show should bother to cast either Willas or Garlan?  They're both relatively useless and play no part in the proceedings.  It's one of the many necessary consolidating character cuts the show needs to make.In fact, you could even make an argument that Mace Tyrell doesn't absolutely have to be on the show although he's been namechecked already this season so there's a very good chance he'll appear in Season 4.

I meant that considering that Willas doesn't appear on-screen, his name can still be called upon as they won't have to cast anyone to play a mentioned character..duh. In situations where there's no need to cast actors I think they should follow the book names instead of replacing the said character.

In situations where there's no need to cast actors I think they should follow the book names instead of replacing the said character.But if the people who think that Loras will be forced into the Kingsguard because of the plot to marry him to Sansa are right, then that will finally give Finn Jones something to do. He's been pretty much a glorified extra this season so far.
4194	Craven Mummer	2013-04-17	I read a review that stated one if the most intense scenes was with Varys and Tyrion where Varys describes how he was cut. If the critics only got 1-4 then we're in for a powerful scene. I don't remember GRRM describing this in the books, but my memory is for shit anyway. Anyone remember?

In situations where there's no need to cast actors I think they should follow the book names instead of replacing the said character.I guess they could but I also think the show should avoid namechecking characters that they aren't going to bother to show at some point.  There are literally hundreds of characters the audience is being asked to follow and adding another one to the mix that doesn't end up appearing muddies the waters even more.Additionally, they've already developed the character of Loras and he is familiar to the audience.  He doesn't have a ton to do this season otherwise so why not connect him to Sansa for this plot (especially since there is already a clear link with them that was established previously)?I like the idea that we have a stark contrast in Sansa's betrothal options.  Loras is the idealized "knight in shining armour" that she has always idolized and she is going to have that possibility ripped from her in favour of Tyrion.  You need this contrast to justify Sansa's disgust and/or uneasiness with Tyrion since he's actually been pretty damn decent to her on the show.  We need to understand why she is not going to treat Tyrion sympathetically and having him instead of some unseen cripple in a place she's never been doesn't really do it.  Making it more about her being denied Loras seems more logical.
4196	TheWhiteRabbit	2013-04-17	I am so excited for this episode. Like pre-blackwater premier excited!!!!
4197	TheWhiteRabbit	2013-04-17	I read a review that stated one if the most intense scenes was with Varys and Tyrion where Varys describes how he was cut. If the critics only got 1-4 then we're in for a powerful scene. I don't remember GRRM describing this in the books, but my memory is for shit anyway. Anyone remember?Yes, though I can't remember which book. He basically had his cock chopped off so some magician could perform some dark magic. That's why in the Blackwater episode from last season we get a foreshadowing of this conversation when Varys asks Tyrion if he ever told him how he was cut and goes on to state that Stannis has taken up with a red priestest from Ashai who knows the dark arts, and that he could think of no one worse to sit upon the iron chair.

We of course know now why it has been omitted or delayed.  I think it would make a lot of sense for him to appointed there later this season as a way to block the Sansa betrothal once the Lannisters catch wind of it.

I think it would make a lot of sense for him to appointed there later this season as a way to block the Sansa betrothal once the Lannisters catch wind of it.ahhh yes he has been promised to joined it but hasn't been placed on it yet now i remember. Good point
4201	King Tommen	2013-04-17	ahhh yes he has been promised to joined it but hasn't been placed on it yet now i remember.Good pointActually, as far as the show goes, he hasn't joined or been asked.  In book timelines, I think he got appointed when Joffrey was dishing out the awards after Blackwater in ACoK.  On the show, they had that scene but when Loras spoke, he simply followed the Lannister/Tyrell script and asked for Margaery to be betrothed to Joffrey. No Kingsguard.I imagine that he will join eventually though and as I said, my suspicion is that he'll be forced into it to get him out of the picture once the Lannisters figure out what the Tyrell's are up to with Sansa.
4202	Newstar	2013-04-17	On what happens to Loras after the Loras/Sansa engagement presumably falls through (spoilers for TV show):
	Spoiler In the big Entertainment Weekly feature, the journalist described the filming of Sansa's wedding. There was an exchange between Cersei and Margaery the journalist mentioned. Margaery said (to Cersei) something along the lines of "We'll be sisters soon," and Cersei shoots back "Call me your sister again and I'll strangle you in your sleep."Mother and daughter, for sure, since Cersei will become Margaery's mother-in-law, but sisters? The only way the "sisters" line makes sense--assuming the journalist heard properly and isn't making stuff up--is if Loras and Cersei are indeed betrothed, however briefly, since that would make Cersei and Margeaery sisters-in-law.There's a shot in a few of the featurettes of Loras storming away from a dinner with the QOT, Margaery and some others and then glaring down balefully at everyone. I thought it was from Sansa and Tyrion's wedding, but it could also be the following: after the QOT has told Loras he's to marry Sansa, or after he's been informed he's to marry Cersei instead. I'm pretty sure either option would piss him off, although Cersei probably more so, LOL.I kind of like the idea of a Loras/Cersei engagement. There would be some epic bitchface going on, I think.
More spoilers for the TV show re: Loras:
	Spoiler Finn Jones mentioned in an interview that he was vastly relieved that he wouldn't have to wear armour this season. So either he joins the Kingsguard and disappears, or he only joins the Kingsguard at the very end of the season.

That would definitely be interesting.
4206	Connor Snow	2013-04-18	Actually, the fight between Beric and Sandor is happening in episode 5, according to the synopsis.Ramsay betraying Theon.Sansa and Loras betrothalArya meeting BericJaime and Brienne arrive at HarrenhalDoes this mean we get some Roose?
4207	Connor Snow	2013-04-18	Ran said in his preview of the first 4 eps Roose only has about 5 lines of dialogue so I'm hoping episode 5 is him and Jaime's chat, and it better be god damn awesome.
4208	Nictarion	2013-04-18	From what I hear Dracarys is the final scene and its totally awesome.I can't wait. Probably my favorite single moment from the books. Hope they do it justice.
4209	Nazurane	2013-04-18	Melisandre coming to the brotherhood because of her fires to sacrifice Gendry for his kings blood or at the very least taking him back to DragonStone. So his character will be a mix of Gendry and Edric Storm. I feel like it wil be either this episode or the next.I'm re-reading ASoS at the moment and I just read the scene where Melisandre tosses the leeches with edric storms blood into the fire.  There are three: one for Balon Greyjoy, one for Joeffrey and one for Robb. I think that this is a cool image and it would make a great scene.For this to happen Genry would have to be wounded somehow (perhaps during the fight Beric vs. Hound). Melisandre brings the leeches back to Dragenstone and 'poof poof poof'. And it would also be great forshadowing for the series-only audience.
4210	Razha	2013-04-18	That would definitely be interesting.This is pure speculation on my part but could it be that:
	Spoiler  Loras + Sansa wedding is planned butLannisters not just outsmart the Tyrrels but offer an alternative arrangement:Sansa marries Tyrionbut Loras is bethrothed to Sersei(or Sersei can be bethrothed to Willas - who is mentioned but never shown)

Melisandre brings the leeches back to Dragenstone and 'poof poof poof'. And it would also be great forshadowing for the series-only audience.Selyse and Shereen have been cast - so they must show them sooner or later - thus I think Mel will bring Gendry to the DragonstoneShereen can befriend Gendry and by the end Mels true intentions are revealed 
	Spoiler  season ends with Gendry escaping with help of Davos (thus fully following Edric Storm story) or if they decide to make even greater alterations  - maybe Davos manages to influence Staniss and Gendry is spared.. and even taken to the wall next season

4212	Tyrion4President	2013-04-18	What I get from the episode title is that Mormont will be killed.Judging from this article: http://www.hollywood...lk-third-439307 the next episode is going to be one of the big ones. So, the sack of Astapor is going to be epic? I sure hope so!Nice article, this quote got me excited!"It was good to see, because as the series goes on, we have more and more scenes like that. We have a giant battle episode in season four that's going to be incredibly difficult to pull off."I hope by giant battle they are referring to the war on the wall /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' />
4213	Where Boars Glow	2013-04-18	I read a review that stated one if the most intense scenes was with Varys and Tyrion where Varys describes how he was cut. If the critics only got 1-4 then we're in for a powerful scene. I don't remember GRRM describing this in the books, but my memory is for shit anyway. Anyone remember?yes it was in the books.
4214	Where Boars Glow	2013-04-18	Does anyone know which episode Martin is writing this season?
4215	WhiteGuts	2013-04-18	"The Bair and the Maiden Fair", the 7th I think.
4216	Nazurane	2013-04-18	Selyse and Shereen have been cast - so they must show them sooner or later - thus I think Mel will bring Gendry to the DragonstoneShereen can befriend Gendry and by the end Mels true intentions are revealed

True, Gendry could be brought to dragonstone. The question will be if they keep Gendry as a character/ Joe Dempsey as an actor to continue a storyline thats not from the books (they have so many characters on the show, and I think that we will have to part with some characters to make room for others)
4217	Magic 8 Ball	2013-04-18	Given the show's recent penchant for jarringly inappropriate modern music, maybe they will play "Tro-lo-lo" at the end of Theon's scene?
4218	AdiTarg	2013-04-18	My guess is that the name of the episode refers to Mormont's death, and the freedom of the unsullied (cause now their watch, slavery, has ended).
4219	Father of Dragons	2013-04-18	My assumptions:
-The mutiny (sad yet exciting) with Sam, Green, Edd, Gilly & her son escaping, but getting separated (probably no Sam the slayer yet)
-Goodbye to Kraznys
-More Jaime/Brienne/Locke
-More three-eyed-crow dreams
-Cersei/Tywin chat
-Tyrell marriage proposal
-Theon/R scenes (possible at the Dreadfort, since R said "ride east"
-Reunion with Beric
I also saw Rast behind Mormont and Crasters charging at who I assume is Burn Gorman
4220	eetrebor	2013-04-18	Given the show's recent penchant for jarringly inappropriate modern music, maybe they will play "Tro-lo-lo" at the end of Theon's scene?It was one instance which was announced beforehand, I don't know why people were so surprised by it.

4229	Mark Antony	2013-04-19	1. Three standout scenes from the book go down. One only begins, one is about what we expected, and one is everything we could have wanted and more.So Hound vs Beric is the one that only begins, Mutiny at Crasters one that was what they expected, and Dracarys everything they could of wanted and more. My guess.
4230	Whoresbane Umber	2013-04-19	A lot of people expect it to be changed for the TV show.Also, the preview makes it pretty obvious that the Beric/Hound fight will be in episode 4. I was hoping to meet Beric earlier.So are they not making loras part of the kingsguard
4231	Nezzer	2013-04-19	So are they not making loras part of the kingsguardI think he will still join the Kingsguard, but later this season, after spending some time betrothed to Sansa. Tywin will probably force him to join the Kingsguard when he breaks the betrothal.
4232	Winterz	2013-04-19	I think he will still join the Kingsguard, but later this season, after spending some time betrothed to Sansa. Tywin will probably force him to join the Kingsguard when he breaks the betrothal.Tywin isn't going to force him at all. The Kingsguard was Loras' reward and was promised to him hence why Loras betrothal to Sansa will be unlikely.
4233	Nezzer	2013-04-19	Tywin isn't going to force him at all. The Kingsguard was Loras' reward and was promised to him hence why Loras betrothal to Sansa will be unlikely.That's how it happened in the books, but in the show Loras was never promised to join the Kingsguard. All he asked as a reward was that Joffrey married Margaery.
4234	Winterz	2013-04-19	That's how it happened in the books, but in the show Loras was never promised to join the Kingsguard. All he asked as a reward was that Joffrey married Margaery.You sure of this? I may be confusing it but from what I remember of Season 2's last episode he asked to join the Kingsguard and was accepted by Joffrey in order to be by his sister's side?! I could be mistaken ofc.

4236	Winterz	2013-04-19	Okay then, my bad, confusing stuff :s
Thanks for clearing it up.
4237	Tom son of Tom	2013-04-19	I'm so giddy thinking about the "Dracarys" scene. It's gonna be epic,
4238	wolverine	2013-04-19	Just looked at the title and after careful thought I think it is about Mormont getting the axe...
although it could be about Jon getting laid!
4239	ugashep	2013-04-20	Question: If Sansa will be slated by the Tyrells to marry Loras on the TV show instead of Willas, how are they going to get around the whole "Loras is a man of the kingsguard" thing? Men of the Kingsguard are like men of the nw, no marriage, no kids, no sex (officially). I see the reasoning behind the Loras assumption but don't you think it'll still be Willas, and we'll hear about him, that will add drama to the whole Tyrell vs. Martell/Red Viper arch that will be important next season.

I see the reasoning behind the Loras assumption but don't you think it'll still be Willas, and we'll hear about him, that will add drama to the whole Tyrell vs. Martell/Red Viper arch that will be important next season.This has already been discussed here. Loras is not yet a man of the Kingsguard, in the show. They will probably plan the wedding between Sansa and Loras, until Tywin hears of it, marries Sansa to Tyrion, and names Loras a knight of the Kingsguard. To me, this makes perfect sense.
4241	wolverine	2013-04-20	Poor Sansa.  This would actually be a much more devastating turn for her than what happened in the book.
4242	Fred Stark	2013-04-20	Poor Sansa.  This would actually be a much more devastating turn for her than what happened in the book.LOL..I understand  what you meant mate...but  I think even though it would be a sexless marriage,Sansa would have  felt a bit better marrying Loras than Tyrion..the Lannister basically wiped out her entire family and changed her identity as a Lannister .Whereas with Loras,she would be away from KL and have some peace with Lady Olenna  and  Margaery.However I feel Willas is nevertheless the best choice.
4243	Fred Stark	2013-04-20	I just hope that   Sansa's marriage will be  shown in her perspective(POV)..you know..I want the non-readers to be equally surprised as Sansa herself when she  see Tyrion at the end of the aisle.
Totally unrelated,I kinda ship Sansa with Gendry Waters..he seems to be the only nice guy,age appropriate guy for her in the series..Arya and Gendry are too alike
4244	Sansa in the North	2013-04-20	I'm so giddy thinking about the "Dracarys" scene. It's gonna be epic,I actually hope that she doesn't say Dracarys. We heard it already last season so the audience would know what's coming immediately if she uses it again. She could say "a dragon is not a slave" or something like that. Cue destruction /devil.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':devil:' />I just hope that   Sansa's marriage will be  shown in her perspective(POV)..you know..I want the non-readers to be equally surprised as Sansa herself when she  see Tyrion at the end of the aisle.I agree! I want the audience to be surprised and, more importantly, I want them to feel sympathy for Sansa, not just Tyrion. But I fear that if she refuses to kneel to him a lot of the audience will be on his side and the Sansa hate will be going strong again.

They will probably plan the wedding between Sansa and Loras, until Tywin hears of it, marries Sansa to Tyrion, and names Loras a knight of the Kingsguard. To me, this makes perfect sense.Sorry man. I'm new and still finding my way around the site. I can see why they would do it with Loras however I think (SPOILER) if you take away the fact that the red viper crippled Mace Tyrell's son you take away some personal vitriol from the dynamic that I suspect will dominate King's Landing next season along with Joffrey's wedding and Tyrion issues. It is not like they need to cast someone as Willas to mention him, and people have been mentioned in prior seasons before without being seen to build up suspense for important later plots, Stannis, Mance Rayder, the Brotherhood, etc. It is well established that Loras is gay on the show and that Margaery knows it and loves her brother, it will be just as humorous for Sansa to assume its Loras initially only to be disappointed as it was in the books. You guys may be right though, we'll see.
4246	Dragonstoned	2013-04-20	Would be some displaced revenge for Tywin if he name's Mace Tyrell's favourite son to the KG, thereby taking away all his powers to marry or inherit, given that Aerys did the same for him with Jaime.
4247	Newstar	2013-04-20	I just hope that   Sansa's marriage will be  shown in her perspective(POV)..you know..I want the non-readers to be equally surprised as Sansa herself when she  see Tyrion at the end of the aisle.That won't happen. The ep descriptions for 3x06 and 3x07 state that Tywin "plans strategic unions" in 3x06 (one of which is surely Sansa/Tyrion) and that Shae "chafes at Tyrion's new situation" in 3x07 (his situation being his betrothal, since I doubt she would very much care about his appointment as Master of Coin, LOL). There's even the possibility that Sansa learns of her wedding with a bit more warning than she had in the books (where she found out the day of), since the 3x07 ep summary also states that Sansa is "fretting about her prospects." Why would she be "fretting" unless she'd already found out about her engagement to Tyrion?I agree! I want the audience to be surprisedThey won't be by 3x08, anyway, from the sounds of it.and, more importantly, I want them to feel sympathy for Sansa, not just Tyrion. But I fear that if she refuses to kneel to him a lot of the audience will be on his side and the Sansa hate will be going strong again.Well, it kind of is what it is. It's a little strange to get mad at viewers for having a strong, negative reaction to something a character does and blame them for reacting that way; the fault would lie with GRRM/the showrunners. See also Sansa's nastiness to her septa in Season 1, to which many viewers had a strong, negative reaction. It wasn't their fault; it was the writers' (not GRRM's, since Book Sansa would not act that way).You might want viewers to feel sympathy for Sansa, but how about letting them make up their own minds about the character and how sympathetic she is, rather than assuming they should share your opinion and worrying that they won't?the Sansa hate will be going strong again.Well, if the shoe fits...In the books, Sansa's treatment of Tyrion--especially her refusal to kneel--led to a lot of reader hate, almost as much as lying about Arya and going to Cersei in AGOT. It's not unreasonable to assume that viewers will have a similar reaction but again, that's not their fault: it's GRRM's, for writing it that way.From a strict books/TV adaptation perspective, though, Sansa's already got a few strikes against her that she didn't have in the books, meaning that the reaction against her actions might be even stronger than in the books. Loras is gay as opposed to Willas, making her dream of a blissful, Tyrell marriage look like a dumb, schoolgirl pipe dream in the show as opposed to a semi-realistic shot at happiness. Another problem is that TV Tyrion is not bad-looking and still has his nose. If he were unattractive and were missing his nose, I think TV viewers would be a lot more understanding about her reluctance to marry him, TV being a very visual medium at all, but given that Tyrion on the show is attractive and has a rather dashing scar instead of a disfiguring facial injury, it's not going to make Sansa look particularly sympathetic if she's disgusted and horrified by being married to someone with Tyrion's appearance (and prejudiced to boot, since the problem would be his dwarfism rather than his extremely ugly, noseless face). Finally, TV Tyrion has been whitewashed in general and has been unfailingly polite and solicitous to Sansa in particular to the point where I almost think viewers in watching Sansa chafe at being married to Tyrion would be all "WTF is this bitch complaining about?"There are ways to redress the balance in these issues and make Sansa look more sympathetic: emphasize Tyrion's age (he's much older on the show), emphasize Sansa's youth (although the actress was 16 when Season 3 was filmed and looks older), stress that Tyrion is marrying Sansa to make a land grab for Winterfell and destroy the Starks' legacy, emphasize Sansa's hatred and fear of the Lannisters, emphasize Sansa's terror of being raped (and Tyrion coming thisclose to having sex with her against her will), etc. etc. But it does seem as if the deck is potentially stacked a bit already so that viewers will be predisposed to view Sansa poorly as a result of the mess, depending again on the writing and how it actually plays out.

4248	SoManyVows	2013-04-20	What we know for sure about this episode and what I think will happen, broken down by character groups. Long post, so fair warning.The Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch:From the Synopsis: â<U+0080><U+009C>The Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch takes stock.â<U+0080><U+009D>From the Promo: Craster ranting against the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch for calling him a bastard, Mormont drawing his sword, Sam screaming â<U+0080><U+009C>We have to go!â<U+0080><U+009D>Speculation: The Mutiny, as led by Rast and the Ranger played by Burn Gorman, who we saw briefly last week (Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>d be cool if he ends up being Dirk, Garth Greenway, or Ollo, but heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll probably stay unnamed). Craster and Lord Commander Mormount die. Sam flees with Gilly and possibly Grenn and Edd as well. I do not think that we will see The Slayer in this episode â<U+0080><U+0093> that will happen later in the season.Jon:Synopsis: NothingPromo: Nothing.Speculation: Jon may sit this episode out (On the previous page, Tito5601 refers to one set of characters who have been in every episode so far taking the week off â<U+0080><U+0093> Jon and the Wildlings or Robb and Catelyn seem to be the only ones that fit). Nevertheless, my guess is that weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll get some scenes with him and the Wilding raiding party to establish his growing friendliness with Tormund (from the New Character video - â<U+0080><U+009C>I like you, boy, but if you play us false, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll pull your guts out through your throatâ<U+0080><U+009D>) and his mutual antipathy with Orell - maybe this is when Jon gets attacked by his eagle?  Ygritte defends Jon, and possibly claims that theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re sleeping together: (â<U+0080><U+009C>Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no crow.â<U+0080><U+009D>/â<U+0080><U+009C>Just cause you want him inside you doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t make him one of usâ<U+0080><U+009D>.) I think that Jon and Ygritteâ<U+0080><U+0099>s first sexual encounter will be saved for the cave to make a greater impact.Jaime and Brienne:Synopsis: NothingPromo: Brief shots of Brienne grabbing a sword, and Locke drawing his.Speculation: Jaime slips into a fever and develops a fatalistic attitude. Brienne goads him into keeping up his strength. Later, Brienne manages to grab a sword and tries to escape, but Locke and his crew manage to subdue her, possibly by threatening Jaime.Arya:Synopsis: â<U+0080><U+009C>Arya is taken to the commander of the Brotherhoodâ<U+0080><U+009D>Promo: Multiple shots of Beric, Arya, Gendry, and the Hound in the cave.Speculation: Arya, Gendry, and the Hound are taken to the cave and meet Beric. The Hound is confronted with his crimes and sentenced to trial by battle. The actual trial will take place in Episode 5.Robb and Catelyn:Synopsis: NothingPromo: NothingSpeculation: Robb and Catelyn will probably sit this episode out â<U+0080><U+0093> other than Jon and the Wildlings and the Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing crew, theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re the only character group that has appeared in all three episodes so far, and we know that there will be scenes in Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing. The only reason Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m skeptical is that I read somewhere that Richard Madden will appear in every episode this season (donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know how much stock to put into that). If Robb does appear, my guess is that we get some scenes of Robb discussing his increasingly dire position with his allies (â<U+0080><U+009C>Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve won every battle, but Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m losing this warâ<U+0080><U+009D>). Maybe this is where the plan to attack Casterly Rock is proposed (â<U+0080><U+009C>Take his home, take his gold, take his powerâ<U+0080><U+009D>) but that will probably be saved for a later episode.Karstark killing the Lannister boys will probably be saved for Episode 5 (where the synopsis says Robb is betrayed).Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing:Synopsis: â<U+0080><U+009C>Varys meets his better.â<U+0080><U+009D>Promo: Cersei, Olenna, Joffrey, Margaery, Tyrion, and Tywin all appear. Promotional photos seem to indicate Sansa will appear as well.Speculation: Alan Sepinwallâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pre-season review indicates that Varys tells Tyrion the story of how he became a eunuch in one of episodes he saw. Critics only got the first four episodes, so that has to happen here. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll probably be in the same scene where the two of them are looking down into the secret passageway, and Varys tells Tyrion â<U+0080><U+009C>The revenge that you want will be yours in time.â<U+0080><U+009D>Varys meeting his better hints at his meeting with The Queen of Thorns (â<U+0080><U+009C>He would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashesâ<U+0080><U+009D>).The Queen of Thorns will also tangle with Cersei ("We do what we can to keep our sons from the graveâ<U+0080><U+009D>â<U+0080><U+009C>.)  Joffrey and Margaery have some kind of public unveiling (the scene with them on the sept). Later Cersei goes to Tywin and tells him that the Tyrells are a problem.I agree that the Tyrell marriage plot will be introduced in this episode, with Margaery and Queen of Thorns discussing it with Sansa and probably Loras (who will stand in for Willas Tyrell). Sansa probably wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t break the news to Littlefinger yet â<U+0080><U+0093> once she does, Tywin finds out soon after and Tywin probably wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t find out until Episode 6.Theon:Synopsis: NothingPromo: â<U+0080>Boyâ<U+0080><U+0099> leading Theon into a tunnel.Speculation: I think that the speculation that King Tommen referred to in his post is likely. â<U+0080><U+009C>Boyâ<U+0080><U+009D> will be revealed to be working with the torturers, and Theon will be recaptured. â<U+0080>Boyâ<U+0080><U+0099> will not yet be revealed as Ramsay (Reviews by non-reader critics suggest that this storyline makes no damn sense to them. It would be slightly less obscure if Ramsay had been revealed).Daenerys:Synopsis: â<U+0080><U+009C>Dany exchanges a chain for a whipâ<U+0080><U+009D>.Promo: Dany handing over Drogon to Kraznys in exchange for the Unsullied.Speculation: Dracarys.

4249	Newstar	2013-04-20	Bran and the Reeds sat out last week, and as thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no sign of them in the promo, my guess is that theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll be absent again.There is a blink-and-you'll-miss-it shot of Bran falling from a tree (from a dream, mirroring his fall from the tower in Season 1), so I think there will be one scene, but it won't be the focus of the episode.
4250	Chuck88	2013-04-20	Great post by the way. Props for taking the time to pull all that together /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />
4251	King Tommen	2013-04-20	What we know for sure about this episode and what I think will happen, broken down by character groups. Long post, so fair warning.The Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch:From the Synopsis: â<U+0080><U+009C>The Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch takes stock.â<U+0080><U+009D>From the Promo: Craster ranting against the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch for calling him a bastard, Mormont drawing his sword, Sam screaming â<U+0080><U+009C>We have to go!â<U+0080><U+009D>Speculation: The Mutiny, as led by Rast and the Ranger played by Burn Gorman, who we saw briefly last week (Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>d be cool if he ends up being Dirk, Garth Greenway, or Ollo, but heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll probably stay unnamed). Craster and Lord Commander Mormount die. Sam flees with Gilly and possibly Grenn and Edd as well. I do not think that we will see The Slayer in this episode â<U+0080><U+0093> that will happen later in the season.Jon:Synopsis: NothingPromo: Nothing.Speculation: Jon may sit this episode out (On the previous page, Tito5601 refers to one set of characters who have been in every episode so far taking the week off â<U+0080><U+0093> Jon and the Wildlings or Robb and Catelyn seem to be the only ones that fit). Nevertheless, my guess is that weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll get some scenes with him and the Wilding raiding party to establish his growing friendliness with Tormund (from the New Character video - â<U+0080><U+009C>I like you, boy, but if you play us false, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll pull your guts out through your throatâ<U+0080><U+009D>) and his mutual antipathy with Orell - maybe this is when Jon gets attacked by his eagle?  Ygritte defends Jon, and possibly claims that theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re sleeping together: (â<U+0080><U+009C>Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no crow.â<U+0080><U+009D>/â<U+0080><U+009C>Just cause you want him inside you doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t make him one of usâ<U+0080><U+009D>.) I think that Jon and Ygritteâ<U+0080><U+0099>s first sexual encounter will be saved for the cave to make a greater impact.Jaime and Brienne:Synopsis: NothingPromo: Brief shots of Brienne grabbing a sword, and Locke drawing his.Speculation: Jaime slips into a fever and develops a fatalistic attitude. Brienne goads him into keeping up his strength. Later, Brienne manages to grab a sword and tries to escape, but Locke and his crew manage to subdue her, possibly by threatening Jaime.Arya:Synopsis: â<U+0080><U+009C>Arya is taken to the commander of the Brotherhoodâ<U+0080><U+009D>Promo: Multiple shots of Beric, Arya, Gendry, and the Hound in the cave.Speculation: Arya, Gendry, and the Hound are taken to the cave and meet Beric. The Hound is confronted with his crimes and sentenced to trial by battle. The actual trial will take place in Episode 5.Robb and Catelyn:Synopsis: NothingPromo: NothingSpeculation: Robb and Catelyn will probably sit this episode out â<U+0080><U+0093> other than Jon and the Wildlings and the Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing crew, theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re the only character group that has appeared in all three episodes so far, and we know that there will be scenes in Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing. The only reason Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m skeptical is that I read somewhere that Richard Madden will appear in every episode this season (donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know how much stock to put into that). If Robb does appear, my guess is that we get some scenes of Robb discussing his increasingly dire position with his allies (â<U+0080><U+009C>Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve won every battle, but Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m losing this warâ<U+0080><U+009D>). Maybe this is where the plan to attack Casterly Rock is proposed (â<U+0080><U+009C>Take his home, take his gold, take his powerâ<U+0080><U+009D>) but that will probably be saved for a later episode.Karstark killing the Lannister boys will probably be saved for Episode 5 (where the synopsis says Robb is betrayed).Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing:Synopsis: â<U+0080><U+009C>Varys meets his better.â<U+0080><U+009D>Promo: Cersei, Olenna, Joffrey, Margaery, Tyrion, and Tywin all appear. Promotional photos seem to indicate Sansa will appear as well.Speculation: Alan Sepinwallâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pre-season review indicates that Varys tells Tyrion the story of how he became a eunuch in one of episodes he saw. Critics only got the first four episodes, so that has to happen here. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll probably be in the same scene where the two of them are looking down into the secret passageway, and Varys tells Tyrion â<U+0080><U+009C>The revenge that you want will be yours in time.â<U+0080><U+009D>Varys meeting his better hints at his meeting with The Queen of Thorns (â<U+0080><U+009C>He would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashesâ<U+0080><U+009D>).The Queen of Thorns will also tangle with Cersei ("We do what we can to keep our sons from the graveâ<U+0080><U+009D>â<U+0080><U+009C>.)  Joffrey and Margaery have some kind of public unveiling (the scene with them on the sept). Later Cersei goes to Tywin and tells him that the Tyrells are a problem.I agree that the Tyrell marriage plot will be introduced in this episode, with Margaery and Queen of Thorns discussing it with Sansa and probably Loras (who will stand in for Willas Tyrell). Sansa probably wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t break the news to Littlefinger yet â<U+0080><U+0093> once she does, Tywin finds out soon after and Tywin probably wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t find out until Episode 6.Theon:Synopsis: NothingPromo: â<U+0080>Boyâ<U+0080><U+0099> leading Theon into a tunnel.Speculation: I think that the speculation that King Tommen referred to in his post is likely. â<U+0080><U+009C>Boyâ<U+0080><U+009D> will be revealed to be working with the torturers, and Theon will be recaptured. â<U+0080>Boyâ<U+0080><U+0099> will not yet be revealed as Ramsay (Reviews by non-reader critics suggest that this storyline makes no damn sense to them. It would be slightly less obscure if Ramsay had been revealed).Daenerys:Synopsis: â<U+0080><U+009C>Dany exchanges a chain for a whipâ<U+0080><U+009D>.Promo: Dany handing over Drogon to Kraznys in exchange for the Unsullied.Speculation: Dracarys.

In a busy episode like this one, there might not be room for slower scenes like these.Agree pretty much completely but one addition: there appears to be a shot in the preview of Bran falling from a tower which would indicate he might be having a dream of his S1 fall which means we'll probably get at least 1 scene of him and the crew discussing his dream (maybe it's just him and Jojen).

You guys are right - there's a brief shot at the end of someone falling from a tree. Good eyes! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />  I wasn't sure it was Bran the first time I watched, but now I'm not sure who else it could be. So Bran and the Reeds will make at least a brief appearance in this episode.So it looks like there will be 8 locations/storylines featured in this episode, counting the King's Landing storyline as one (it's really more like five - Tyrion/Varys, Olenna/Varys, Olenna/Cersei, Cersei/Tywin, The Tyrells/Sansa, but no need to parse things too finely). The missing characters will be 1) Stannis, Melisandre, and Davos, 2) either Jon and the Wildlings or Robb, Catelyn and the Tullys (the latter is more likely), and 3) a few of the King's Landing players (maybe Shae and Littlefinger)? Definitely a busy episode, but I think that's going to about be par for the course for the rest of this season.

4253	Newstar	2013-04-20	3) a few of the King's Landing players (maybe Shae and Littlefinger)I think you're right. The episode sounds like it will have a lot of KL material, but it also sounds like Littlefinger and Shae sit this one out. I'm curious as to when Littlefinger is going to leave for the Eyrie, as well.

4255	Joyful Union	2013-04-20	Great Post SoManyVows, and welcome to the forum! Look forward to such posts in the future.
4256	Nobody of the canals	2013-04-20	On what happens to Loras after the Loras/Sansa engagement presumably falls through (spoilers for TV show):
	Spoiler In the big Entertainment Weekly feature, the journalist described the filming of Sansa's wedding. There was an exchange between Cersei and Margaery the journalist mentioned. Margaery said (to Cersei) something along the lines of "We'll be sisters soon," and Cersei shoots back "Call me your sister again and I'll strangle you in your sleep."Mother and daughter, for sure, since Cersei will become Margaery's mother-in-law, but sisters? The only way the "sisters" line makes sense--assuming the journalist heard properly and isn't making stuff up--is if Loras and Cersei are indeed betrothed, however briefly, since that would make Cersei and Margeaery sisters-in-law.There's a shot in a few of the featurettes of Loras storming away from a dinner with the QOT, Margaery and some others and then glaring down balefully at everyone. I thought it was from Sansa and Tyrion's wedding, but it could also be the following: after the QOT has told Loras he's to marry Sansa, or after he's been informed he's to marry Cersei instead. I'm pretty sure either option would piss him off, although Cersei probably more so, LOL.I kind of like the idea of a Loras/Cersei engagement. There would be some epic bitchface going on, I think.
Are they going to have Cersei and Margery at loggerheads so openly so soon?

4257	King Tommen	2013-04-20	[/size]Are they going to have Cersei and Margery at loggerheads so openly so soon?They were sniping at each other (politely) in the first episode this season.  Makes sense given that the show has given Margaery more screentime at this point than the books did and they've made her political maneuvering more overt. I like them emphasizing the Tyrell/Lannister rift right from the start so we get more context when Joffrey's death occurs as to why the Tyrell's are so dangerous. It also makes Cersei look smarter because she's the first one to sniff out that this isn't going to end well while Joffrey has no clue and even Tywin doesn't really understand the extent to which they're a threat.  It will make Cersei's paranoia with Tommen and Margaery even more logical in future seasons as well.
4258	go joff go	2013-04-20	It seems like the longest the show will let any character, or rather any storyline, go without mention seems to be one episode.  One thing is that it looks like there is going to be at least two and probably four major time consuming scenes this episode at crasters and  in astapor.  I expect all the other scenes to be shorter (likely 2 theons, one bran, one jaimie, and I think one jon/or robb, and 4-5 KL)
4259	The Flaying Man	2013-04-20	Ran said in his preview of the first 4 eps Roose only has about 5 lines of dialogue so I'm hoping episode 5 is him and Jaime's chat, and it better be god damn awesome.The conversation between Roose and Jaime will be in episode 6 according to the synopsis here. I'm really looking forward to that scene.
4260	Ignacia	2013-04-20	@SoMany VowsGreat, post! You forgot the recap though.http://www.youtube.c...h?v=U4kJkoFwfd4Based on the storylines showed in it, I would add:Sansa is in, and it seems LF is in too, since they show the scene were she's making plans with him. I think the Tyrells will propose the marriage to Sansa, and she will spend some time considering what to do about her previous plans. They also show the plans of the LF/Lysa marriage, so maybe LF will leave KL this episode, and Sansa talks to him once more time before he does.Bran is in the recap too, so I think he will appear in this episode.No sight of Robb, Jon or Stannis. May be all of them will be left out?
4261	Colonel Green	2013-04-20	Sansa probably wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t break the news to Littlefinger yet â<U+0080><U+0093> once she does, Tywin finds out soon after and Tywin probably wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t find out until Episode 6.I think the show may alter that part, actually, based on the Shae/Tyrion scene in episode 2.  I speculate that it will be Shae who is told/finds out about the prospective engagement, goes to Tyrion out of concern (not trusting House Tyrell either), and Tyrion goes to Tywin with the information.  This would add more reason for Shae to be angry about what happens, since she clearly right now thinks that she and Tyrion are on the same page in looking out for Sansa.

4263	Newstar	2013-04-20	I think the show may alter that part, actually, based on the Shae/Tyrion scene in episode 2.  I speculate that it will be Shae who is told/finds out about the prospective engagement, goes to Tyrion out of concern (not trusting House Tyrell either), and Tyrion goes to Tywin with the information.  This would add more reason for Shae to be angry about what happens, since she clearly right now thinks that she and Tyrion are on the same page in looking out for Sansa.Yes, if LF leaves KL in Episode 4 (or is already gone by the time the episode starts), I think we can absolve him of ruining the Tyrell match, and I don't know who else would scupper it except Tyrion, on information from Shae, given to Tywin. For those worrying about Sansa coming off unsympathetically as a result of the marriage, if Tyrion turns out to be the one who ruined her shot at Loras Tyrell and escape from King's Landing to Highgarden, that should redress the balance right quick. It would also grey up Tyrion some, which whitewashed TV Tyrion desperately needs, so there's that, too.On the other hand, the "assignment" LF was referencing in 3x01 was going to the Vale to woo Lysa. He mentioned that he might be able to take Sansa with him. Is he going to try, or is he just going to leave? It would be a bit weird if he did all that song and dance about getting her out of the city and didn't at least make a stab at taking her with him, unless there's a scene of him being unable to track her down or somesuch. It makes LF look like a bit of a bungler, which is one of the problems with his TV characterization, but it seems a bit early one way or the other. We'll see pretty shortly, I guess.The other question I had about Littlefinger leaving KL in 3x04 is that it seemed like he had more scenes in KL--the one of him in the throne room with Varys from a promo (although this could be included in 3x04, I guess)--before leaving.Damg I didn't even realize they posted recaps before the episodes.Yeah, I've got to start paying more attention to these...although to be fair, we know Cersei, Joffrey, Margaery, and Olenna are in the episode (a few of them in more than one scene), and the recap didn't feature them at all.So it does look like we will get a littlefinger scene before he leaves.Hard to know. It seems like there should be, but the episode reviews/spoilers don't seem to reference Littlefinger being in the episode (maybe because no one cares about him, LOL). My assumption before seeing the recap was that he would be sitting this one out.

4264	go joff go	2013-04-20	I guess technically neither sansa or LF have to be in the episode since the Tyrell plot is about Sansa.  I was sort of hoping we would get another scene where LF offers to take her now and she refuses, since that would likely mean the LF killing Dontos/Dontos replacement could still be a shock, but that wouldn't make sense as LF doesn't have the authority/wouldn't be worth the risk to do that at this point.  Also they seemed to make a point to keep the Shae/Ros lines in the recap too so maybe one of them will make an appearance.
4265	Ignacia	2013-04-20	Yeah, I've got to start paying more attention to these...although to be fair, we know Cersei, Joffrey, Margaery, and Olenna are in the episode (a few of them in more than one scene), and the recap didn't feature them at all.Well, just like the synopses, the recap doesn't necessarily show all of the storylines that will be in. They do show some of the storylines, though, and I don't think they have ever put scenes in it that aren't related to the episode. So I think it's safe to asume that Bran is in the episode, and that we will have at least one mention to the LF-Sansa plot, even if only one of them shows up.Even if you put together the information from the synopsis, the preview and the recap, you can't know for sure if those are the only storylines that will be featured. For instance, Theon wasn't mentioned in neither of them, but he still appeared in episode 2.

4267	Colonel Green	2013-04-20	For those worrying about Sansa coming off unsympathetically as a result of the marriage, if Tyrion turns out to be the one who ruined her shot at Loras Tyrell and escape from King's Landing to Highgarden, that should redress the balance right quick.I've never understood how people could ever think it was unsympathetic for Sansa to react poorly to being forcibly married to one of the people working to destroy her family (and however nice Tyrion might be, even in the show, that is what he's doing).
4268	Spring Snow	2013-04-20	I've never understood how people could ever think it was unsympathetic for Sansa to react poorly to being forcibly married to one of the people working to destroy her family (and however nice Tyrion might be, even in the show, that is what he's doing).Exactly. Sansa's a terrified young girl being kept as a hostage, who's been told her entire life that people are honorable and she's going to marry a strong, handsome knightly lord. Since coming to King's Landing her world has been continuously falling apart, and then on top of everything she's married off to a Lannister. Tyrion was kind to her once, true, but it's unreasonable to expect that to undo the fact that he's a prominent member of the family that's destroyed her entire life, and a dwarf - considered quite hideous in their society's eyes.I'd like to think that even though Tyrion is much more handsome and sympathetic in the show, people will still feel for Sansa as well... but I'm not sure. A lot of people seem to harbor a really irrational grudge towards her character. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />

(They haven't), so this episode might be where it happens, as Dany 'introduces' her children to Kraznys and tells him to choose one.  Also, re dragons, I had read an interview with one of the CGI creators of the dragons, and he/she said 
	Spoiler  that at some point in the show, Dany will point out the different personalities among the 3 dragons
 so tonight might be the perfect opportunity for that, too.  I'm hoping!

4285	Israel	2013-04-21	Loras is not yet in the Kingsguard--a common speculation is that Tywin will order Joff to order Loras into the Guard to keep him from marrying Sansa (or anyone else who might become a threat to the Lannisters).I just want to say that the actor who's playing Krazyns is--wonderful!  The character is despicable, of course, but the actor is just great.  The flare of hunger and greed in his eyes when Dany mentions the dragons is perfectly done, and his whole body language changes in an instant, his eyes glitter, he leans slightly forward, his nostrils flare, his body tenses--its almost like he's about to spring forward, so eager is he.  Kudos to whoever that actor is--sorry he's gonna become a toaster pastry next week.  I would have enjoyed seeing more of him.what he said, his name is Dan Hildebrand I also notices how good he is.  It turns out that he is such a good character acter he played two separate characters in one episode of Deadwood in 2004 while being a series regular.  He was the inn keeper at Shaughnessy's and he played Tim Driscoll the fake plot owner who gets immediately disposed of.

Heading over there right now.  /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />Haw! Me, too. I have no shame.Comment after reading the spoilers:
	Spoiler Varys and Olenna want to keep Littlefinger away from Sansa? Man, it seems like everyone and their cousin knows that Littlefinger wants to get his hooks into Sansa. How is anyone going to be confused in the slightest as to who took Sansa when she disappears after the PW?Also, is KL ever going to find out about Bran and Rickon's disappearances? Because that was the main reason behind the Tyrell/Lannister push to marry Sansa into their respective families. It almost sounds like Olenna has other, less mercenary reasons for wanting Sansa to marry into the Tyrells. Also, Sansa has to find out at some point that Bran and Rickon are presumed dead, or else it diminishes the tragedy of the RW for her...unless, of course, she doesn't find out until 3x10. "Your mother and brother have both been killed...oh, and also Bran and Rickon are probably dead too."
4300	go joff go	2013-04-21	I hope, whenever the scene happens, that the bolton/Jaimie scene will give some time to bolton's philosphy about keeping classes separate.  That was one of the big things missing from the Arya cupbearer change.  I could see the show using that as an exscuse to punish Locke without actually seeming to be helping Jaimie.
4301	Colonel Green	2013-04-21	Comment after reading the spoilers:

	Spoiler In Olenna's case, of course, she'll end up working with Littlefinger.  I'm guessing this is the show's way of making that a twist, by initially showing her seemingly working against him, and then revealing they're in cahoots.For Varys, the books admittedly don't give us a great sense of what he knows or doesn't know, but I've always thought he probably knows where Sansa is.  Allowing Littlefinger to sow chaos is beneficial to him.
4302	iheartseverus	2013-04-21	I think the news coming to KL that the young Stark boys are missing/dead can be quickly accomplished in just a couple of sentences--someone tells someone else that a messenger arrived with the news...pause...then someone observes, If that's true, then Sansa is next in line to inherit, after the Young Wolf.'  Thus, her value in the game of marriages immediately increases, and the plotting begins.
4303	Colonel Green	2013-04-21	I'd also note that Sansa doesn't have to be literally next in line to have marriage value.  She's Ned Stark's daughter; that's symbolically valuable in making a claim to the North, regardless of whether she's legally the heir (much like the Boltons later use Fake Arya, even though it's acknowledged that Sansa is still alive somewhere).
4304	Sci-2	2013-04-21	Damn, the next ep looks immaculate. Two of the biggest moments of the season, plus more Tyrells and Joffrey and Ramsay, and Lannister Bros. Plus we finally get to meet Beric.Plus a Varys + Tyrion scene. Plus a Varys + QoT scene.Cannot wait.Yeah, I'm incredibly excited for this episode!
4305	briantw	2013-04-21	I'd also note that Sansa doesn't have to be literally next in line to have marriage value.  She's Ned Stark's daughter; that's symbolically valuable in making a claim to the North, regardless of whether she's legally the heir (much like the Boltons later use Fake Arya, even though it's acknowledged that Sansa is still alive somewhere).Considering she's the Lannisters' only hostage at present and the rest of her brothers are traitors, I'd say her value is roughly equivalent to what it would be even if Bran and Rickon were still "alive."

Could you tell me what book and chapter he does?Thank you! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />I'm pretty sure we don't have any indication that he has been told about his fathers death.
4328	PatrickStormborn	2013-04-21	#3 is Robb/Catelyn and co., right?I thought it was more likely to be Jon.
4329	mafalda	2013-04-21	I'm pretty sure we don't have any indication that he has been told about his fathers death.Thanks ohindeed. I thought not, but it's been so long that I wasn't quite sure.
4330	iheartseverus	2013-04-21	From a WiC member:  For our newer folks, 'Elio' is our own exalted Leader O' The Board--Ran.  And Linda is his partner.Just to whet everyoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s appetite for the episode tonight, Elio from Westeros.org tweeted a while ago that in watching the first 4 episodes, the Dracarys scene was genuinely thrilling and extremely well done. He even went out of his way to say that Linda was equally impressed which is essentially the highest compliment because it is well known that she is a rabid purist who hates pretty much everything the show has done to this point
4331	MsLibby	2013-04-21	It looks like he is covered in green slime.

Jaime of course
4334	Other May I?	2013-04-21	It doesn't mention anything in the books about Varys capturing the sorcerer.And even if he did, he wouldn't be likely to show Tyrion.Or if it's just about Varys' "personal life", that would kind of undermine the sense of mystery of the character.They think they can write better than Martin. Every time they try it, they just wind up looking like idiots. Departures from the book should be out of necessity; not because they think their idea is pretty neat.Agreed wholeheartedly.
4335	King Tommen	2013-04-21	From a WiC member:  For our newer folks, 'Elio' is our own exalted Leader O' The Board--Ran.  And Linda is his partner.That WiC member is me! (same username on both sites):Here is the full Elio quote from the "S3 Early Impressions" story on this site:Episodes three and four, I wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t say too much about, beyond the fact that ... yes, it gets better from episode to episode, and each of these have very strong endings, and all in all they are quite eventful. They also allow some of the cast members to truly shine, in a way that leaves us excited for the continuations of their stories. In fact, to go further about just how good these endings are, and how solid these first episodes are in general, some of you may know how disappointed Linda was in the finale last season. Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hadâ<U+0080><U+0094>and continues to haveâ<U+0080><U+0094>some pretty strong views on the adaptation. But to her surprise, she found one particular storyline this seasonâ<U+0080><U+0094>Daenerysâ<U+0080><U+0099>sâ<U+0080><U+0094>is perhaps somewhat redemptive of the hash they made of Qarth last season (some might find â<U+0080><U+009C>somewhatâ<U+0080><U+009D> to not be all that much, but this just shows how strongly she hated what they did with the previous season!) The finale for episode four gave us both goosebumps, and in a good way. It was fantastic, almost exactly as we envisioned it.

(same username on both sites):Here is the full Elio quote from the "S3 Early Impressions" story on this site:Lol, well, Hi, again!  /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />  So excited--Ran and Linda don't often use the word 'fantastic' lightly.
4337	morningxstar	2013-04-21	Is Beric played by the same actor who plays him briefly in season 1?
4338	Warden of the North121	2013-04-21	Is Beric played by the same actor who plays him briefly in season 1?The guy in Season 1 was just a featured extra. Richard Dormer will play him this season.
4339	eRome	2013-04-21	Is Beric played by the same actor who plays him briefly in season 1?No.
