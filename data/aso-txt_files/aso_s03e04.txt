"Darth Pipes",2013-04-21,"ill give it a 10 perfect in almost every way the end with dany was epic they gave you a great sense of scale with the unsullied as well i was impressed with diana riggs first appearance as the character but tonight they really let the queen of thorns cut and she was a blast the guy playing beric dondarrion was pretty awesome and the scene with clegane was great im glad varys got his cut story and the addition at the end was chilling i said last week that rod serling would have called theons storyline act one of the nightmare theon seems trapped in a recurring nightmare and thats exactly how it played out ramsay kind of looks like an evil version of peeta from the hunger games but i think it works the nights watch mutiny played out wellim only sorry we didnt get mormonts final words with sam that was the only downside in this episode jamie and brienne continues to play out well i liked the bit they added were jamie attempts to fight back apparently during the filming he took a real kick to the ribs tywin saying i knowhe didnt have to yell or evil glare at the scene but you just know he means what he said great job by charles dance im glad theyre finding way to allow bran to be with his family edited by darth pipes 21 april 2013  0911 pm"
"Zman1863",2013-04-21,"i gave it a 9 but thats mainly because the dany scenes were some of the best the show has put out she isnt generally my favorite character but that is probably a top 3 scene in all the books it was excellently done the rest of the episode was not really outstanding i wasnt happy with how the nw scene played out it seemed too chaotic there was also a lot of filler i think they put in the varystyrion scene because they wanted to reintroduce him for the subsequent two scenes which were more substantively important but i thought his cutting story was out of place and bringing in the revenge in a box thing didnt really work for me the other stuff was fine but its still a lot of set up"
"Arya Stalka",2013-04-21,"10 so much about this episode was awesome the spider with tyrion then the lady of thorns margaery working her charm sam manning up and rescuing gilly jaime  brienne telling him off arya busting out sandor cant wait for next epi and finally dany and her army oh lets not forget we find out podrick is hung like a bull bahaha i love that smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  eta theon  the bastard dayum loved that too i smell some reek edited by arya stalka 21 april 2013  1030 pm"

"Jabronius Maximus",2013-04-21,"gave it a solid 8 this season looks very promising aside from catelyn all the book changes make sense and are working pretty consistently great scene with dany too and ramsay that son of a bitch has the exact crazy eye look that i imagined book ramsay would have the actress playing olenna is a top notch choice as well i expected beric to be a bit more of a badass though but thats just my own expectation of the lightning lord as the casting for him was still very good edited by sgt rex power colt 21 april 2013  0921 pm"
"sharkhawk",2013-04-21,"definate 10 the dracarys scene was as badass as the books"
"Fez",2013-04-21,"a 9 for me not quite as good as last weeks 10 overall it was really amazing episode with some great dialogue and moments also beric was goddamn awesome but there were two issues that stopped it from being a perfect 10 1 jack gleeson is so good that i legitimately cant stand watching extended joffrey scenes i know thats a credit to him and the writing but if i so cant stand a scene that ill mute it until its over so i dont have to listen to him thats an issue i know thats my issue but this is my rating even with this the episode would probably still be a 10 but 2 i never much liked the dracarys scene i thought it was silly in the books and i thought it was silly here it never made sense that the slavers would be so stupid i dont care how blinded by greed they are supposed to be so the music was epic and the visuals were cool but i just didnt like the scene i was hoping the writers would find some sort of change to the transaction so that the end effect was the same but that the process would make more sense they didnt so the episode ended on a silly note so its a 9"

"Cornishman",2013-04-21,"exceptional episode i found it to have a certain nuance sophie turner has completely won me over with all the attention that maisie williams received from season 2 for her excellent work portraying arya sohpie was overlooked somewhat that will not be the case with this season in my opinion her scene with margery was incredible work it wont surprise me if hbo submits it to the emmy committee for consideration a slight deviation from the books of course the suggestion for her to marry loras as opposed to his brother but a forgivable one when you see the performance sophie turned out responding to that suggestion ive never been a sansa fan in the books nor the hbo adaptation but sophie turners portrayal has slowly been building block by block this season and i believe episode 4 tonight isnt the culmination but merely the jump off point to some incredible performances yet to come im very very encouraged and looking forward to more i watched this episode tonight at a friends place with a 30 foot screen home theater room with a couple dozen other friends and co workers danys final scenes the last five minutes or so the place was pandemonium and when she gave her dracarys order to drogon i couldnt even hear any of the actors words for the next minute as everyone was going berserk cheering compared with season 2 its my opinion that hbo and the production team has really increased the tempo much sooner this year if this is what we can expect this early in season 3 i have great expectations for what is yet to come 1010 from me hands down my favorite episode in the entire series so far with episode 9 from season 2 of course being the gold standard edited by cornishman 21 april 2013  1103 pm"

"Wankerfell",2013-04-22,"excellent one of the best episodes of the entire series a television show isnt just about dialogue and events its also about pacing which at times the show struggles with hopping from scene to scene and character to character so quickly and abruptly that moments either arent given a chance to land or theyre upon us too quickly for us to invest but this episode was paced perfectly allowing every scene to develop naturally and making 50 minutes feel almost featurelength i especially enjoyed joff and margaery in the sept the little psychopathic king gleefully recounting the most gruesome deaths to befall past targaryen royals the show has made no secret of the tyrells motives yet margaerys obvious pandering to king joff still comes across as sincere the climactic scene at crasters keep was welldone but its also where i lodge my one and only complaint about tonights episode we are never given the impression that mutiny is near our first hint that the crows arent happy comes from rast during the pooshoveling scene but hes always been a negative nancy so his vague threat isnt really a good indicator of dissent within the party needless to say its a bit jarring when factions are already formed and fighting as sam slips out but thats really a minor nitpick the episode overall was tremendous beric dondarrion was excellent and though i sympathized with the dog when he felt like he was being punished for sharing his brothers surname aryas objection to his claims of innocence was an awesome reminder of just how effed up of a person he really is forget jaime is there a character more gray than sandor clegane of course i cant end this without mentioning how sorely i missed seeing jon and the wildlings and robb and the tullys these omissions are not flaws in the episode per se but i must be critical of how little of the northmen weve seen outside of the crows mance is portrayed by a brilliant actormaybe the best actor the show has cast to dateand hes had about three minutes of screen time this season i suppose that will change as the seasonthis one and nextprogresses but its a huge disappointment that so many great characters and actors are getting so little attention i still say ten episodes isnt enough edit i just realized i failed to mention the closing scene with dany the dragon and the unsullied do i even need to it was ridiculously phenomenal edited by wankerfell 22 april 2013  0210 am"

"Sword of the Morning Wood",2013-04-22,"1010 not saying it cant hasnt or wont be bettered but it deserves the 10 good  the mutiny at crasters the tension in the scene was brilliant crasters bluster at being called a bastard and then the seeming calming down and suddenly but you are a bastard badass haertbreaking to see the old bear killed by that shit rast but great tv  theon and boy i really like what theyre doing with this part of the story theons tear stained confession and admission that the starks were his real family and he betrayed them and burned everything good that he had was tough and the full sadism of ramsey dawning on everyone  the bwb great scene mccann was excellent he is the hound for me whoever said his might be the best performances of the show id find it tough to disagree too much hes up there with dinklage and dance for me dondarrion was excellent much better than i even imagined he might be  jamie and brienne not too much happening but these continue to be great scenes we see jamie still has that fight in him but its extinbuished only for brienne to help light a bit of the spark again  loved the qot again her scene with varys was excellent nobodys made the spider squirm like that before  dracarys what a scene that was did the book justice for medany was utterly epic and the scene with her marching out of astapor with her army and her dragons was fantastic sent shivers down my spine i loved catching glimpses of the looks on jorahs and barristans faces a mix of confusion pride and awe ok some the ksl scenes weret great but werent bad bad bran it might have been the first episode since blackwater for a long time with not one poor scene but i thought brans scene with yet another jojen3ec dream was rubbish if they want to establish branss green dreaming ability and what the 3ec is a simple conversation with jojen would be much better no need for a scene like that"
"Alizard Pyre",2013-04-22,"i voted 8 but after a little thinking it deserved 9 the things i didnt like  a little slow many plotting scenes in a raw yes i do love varys and olenna and yes ros was very nice on her scene but there was a moment i thought hm more talking again i enjoyed every bit of dialog but the pace was still a bit slow  the hounds trial the charges seemed a bit farfetched if the brotherhood wants to do justice then they need solid ground i dont know if im making any sense but i felt the whole exchange between sandor and beric about his guilt to be a bit weird  i really liked mormont and i thought his death was too blended in the general chaos what i liked  varys really has a nice part in that episode i thought of all the people saying too many characters too many scenes too short par episode so now it seems we have more of each character in turns i like that especially when we focus on the mysterious and dangerous lord varys his story and then his speech about revenge were really chilling tyrion feels like an immature child asking for an immediate revenge varys answer was a real lesson  i agree with everything said about olenna  the nw scene and the astapor scenes the two high moments of the episode  the look on sandors face when beric says hes the one to fight  never thought bannen could smell so good this sentence sums up the whole thing  tywin prooves again that hes the boss and cersei gets her share of bashing now that we heard the tough words im looking forward to the tough tywin action  the rising tension between cersei and jeoffrey is great  varys and olenna talking about littlefinger finally someone wants to take him down i just hope theyll be able to scratch him at least"
"darksellsword",2013-04-22,"i gave it another 10 im embarassed by my cheerleading but from start to finnish it was perfection the daenerys scene was everything i had hoped for so epic battle at crasters keep was great the guy that killed craster was brilliant the brother hood without banners confronting sandor clegane scene was very good the new dondarrion gets top marks bc he looks and sounds as hard as nails sandor was spot on as usual and if maisie williams doesnt get any award nominations this season for playing arya it will be a crime i really like the fact they are doing so many theon scenes because imo alfie allen is one of the best actors in the show tywin telling cersei what he thinks of her moment i liked that tyrion and varys scene was only second to danys when i seen he had that guy in the box i couldnt help but laughthe locke tormenting jaime part  the poor guy well then again im not a jaime hater anywaydd sirs i take my hat of to you"
"Arrow",2013-04-22,"briennes reaction to jamie whining was just pefection im so happy those two are helping eachother outabsolutely this is the best developing relationship in the series imo  dd are doing it just right started out as enemies but are finding an attachment based on mutual respect and good qualities they discovered in each other along the way that most people dont see in daytoday interactions  those are the best friendships of course the ones where you see people at their worst and still something shines through and the person becomes valued good stuff"

"BlackTalon",2013-04-22,"i gave it a 9 because i want to preserve the 10 for the episode with youknowwhat otherwise a stunning episode it began strong and just kept getting better the cave scene was great just lacked a few bugger yous and the sacking of astapor was everything i had wanted it to be except dany didnt strike kraznys with the harpy whip holy crap certainly the best episode of this season and one of the best four or five episodes of the whole series"
"Dragonblood Stormborn",2013-04-22,"i think emilia clarke is perfect as daenerys targaryen daenerys stormborn  mother of dragons queen of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms khaleesi of the great grass sea breaker of shackleschains queen of meereen and princess of dragonstone ever since dany learned how to use her sexuality to become equal to her beloved khal drogo she has been a bit intense for valid reasons emilia clarke is doing a perfect job imeho and i never think someone else should play the part i only add this because theres been some criticism of her abilities as an actress to evoke the true essence of dany"
"Table8",2013-04-22,"just finished my third viewing i wonder if fans of this show get too blinded by their enthusiasm to effectively rate each episode episode 33 was very mediocre imo which is contrary to the majority of reviewers i gave last weeks episode a 5 and stand by it but this episode was absolutely incredible action packed well written well acted  it had it all and unlike the prior 3 episodes from this season the pacing was very good we saw virtually every character in this episode sans jon snow and despite all the content nothing felt rushed finally high points were everywhere jaimes opening scene succeeded in getting the character some much needed sympathy the directors did a great job conveying the hopelessness of a man always used to getting his way completely powerless i wondered if the show runners were going to take a heavy handed approach to redefining jaime as a hero instead it seems to be thoughtfully portrayed and danywow i wouldnt call myself a dany hater but i certainly am not a fan but this episode really showed power in the character this is the first time since season 1 where dany was actually likable never would have thought id see an episode where a dany scene was the best part not perfect though disliked the way they handled mormonts death the books gave a greater sense of loss as mormont died on sams lap that scene was so theatrical in the book im surprised they left it out it was made for tv gave it an 8 primarily because of my disappointment over the craster scene but if they did that scene better then this would have gotten the highest score i allow myself to give out  a 9 fans on this site are too lenient giving out 10s 10s should be reserved for truly special episodes edited to clarify i gave last weeks episode a 5 this one an eight edited by ronrusso75 22 april 2013  0117 pm"

"Snookson",2013-04-22,"apparently i am in the minority here i thought it was a very average episode except for the ending i gave it a 7 i liked the scenes with jaime and brienne i think ncw did an excellent job portraying jaimes utter physical and emotional defeat really felt the beginning of the episode likewise the ending was incredible i dont think they could have nailed that scene any better danys ruthlessness is finally starting to come out for the nonbook reader crowd the overthrow of mormont at crasters home was not good at all i didnt really even feel any emotion from it that scene should have could have been an episode closer it was that dramatic in the books also did not like the sansamarg scene felt very forced bwb scene was all right did not picture beric like he is in the show margjoff scene was pretty good  basically just continuing to show her manipulation and mischeviousness i love how cersei is getting usurped lena makes some great faces qotvarys was solid on the other hand varys shipping this sorcerer in from the east was bogus that sorcerer represents something very personal that happened to him one of the few chinks in his armor so to speak he is a very private person in regards to himself not the varysspider character i dont think he really would have risked having this dude shipped into the red keep weird theon  meh waiting for ramsay to get freaky the whole podlittlefingerwhoresvarysros circle jerk thing is understandably getting to a point it is just taking its sweet fucking time getting there at the sacrifice of other important things yes littlefinger is up to shit we know this i personally loved varyss comment about how littlefinger may be the most dangerous man in westeros though"

"Swagwell",2013-04-22,"best one this season liked blackwater better though so i gave it an 8 queen of thorns is so great i cared very little for her in the books but the actress really makes her come alive her and varys scene was incredible to watch when ramsay dropped his pious mask to show his true face i thought finally hereâs ramsay i really liked the bwb part especially beric vs sandor crasters keep was ok i guess it did what it was supposed to do jaime and brienne good conversation between them but im really not feeling the reimagined mummers they seem pretty dull compared to the excellence that the original had to me im not asking them to tame zebras for them to ride but they could have at least got some of the dothraki costumes put on one or two of them to make them a little more exotic epic ending but am i the only one who feels astapor seems kinda empty and heavy on the cgi its like they killed five guys and then everybody was free why wouldnt the slaves rebel if it was just as easy as 123 gonna watch it again today but those are my initial feelings about this episode"

"Duncan Disorderly",2013-04-24,"pleased that i picked up on danys little secret last week when she had the whip in her hand and started talking i punched the air and cheered lol for once got played out more or less as i imagined it would as a nonbook viewer i havent found this season too confusing the last two episodes were saved by their endings everything else seems to be rambling along that said i am totally enjoying it also i reserve my full judgement until the end of the season watching them back to back gives me a new perspective in the uk we have thronecast sometimes that fills in any gaps the way i see it the dynamics will radically change anyway once they realise who the real enemy is everything so far is almost a filler building up the tension by far got is the best show i have watched resisting the temptation to buy the books has been tough but i think its better to be surprised i can drown my sorrows in the books when the show ultimately finishes id like to add that so far my favourite scene this season was the chair scene with the imp and sis genius peace"
"Joyful Union",2013-04-24,"also concerning the whole mormont telling sam about his son scene how many nonbook viewers do you think actually know jorah is jeors son none of my nonreading friends know and thus it would be a pretty redundant scenenot to mention cheesy as hell and fairly nonsensical seeing as a lot of the mutineers hated sam in the books and the show and would kill him in a second given the chance"
"Conchobar",2013-04-24,"after watching the episode again last night i changed my vote from a 9 to an 8 the whole fall of lord mormont was not handled very well imo i wish there was more to it like sam holding him as he died and hearing his talk about his son jorah something more emotional than what we got it was far too rushed my parents and a woman at work who do not know the books didnt even realize that mormont was killed or that we was even that important to begin with i still love the rest of the episode its all just so rushed though hbo really dropped the ball with just 10 50minute episodes the season premiere and finale should be 2 hours even 90 mins would sufficesam holding him as he died while men were butchered all around them and mormonts killer the guy who hates sam was probably very close and looking to kill him dont think that would have come across very well on tv without looking cliche and silly"
"RottenAppleFossoway",2013-04-24,"gave it a 10 that was an excellent episode imho as good as any of the entire series my only real complaint is the dearth of bran and jon this season even the scenes they get are either bizarre bran dreams and jojen is in the dreams or too short pretty much every jonwildling scene"
"Kaethas",2013-04-25,"i gave it a big 9 overall it was very good but the ending with dany really pulled it up amazing there are still some things in the various storylines i dont like but you cant get a 100  perfect episode of course"

"Rockroi",2013-04-22,"maybe the two best episodes backtoback in the series history lets get to itwhat i likedslaying the kingslayer the title of the episode is and now his watch is ended and it applied to many in the episode and with jaime it was the end of his life as one of the most fearsome swordsmen in westeros instead jaime is reduced to wanting to die then just wanting his torment to end all the while we see how cruel and helpless war can make even somebody like jaime lannister feel and in some ways become while i really enjoyed how brienne interpalyed with him this episode i thought that it was jaime the whole time that much like the book  captivated me by exposing me to a powerful character made instantly helpless much like watching ned be brought down sansa held against her will etc watching jaime shrink due to the barbarity of war was masterful and nicolai is exceptional as good as any actor on the show fall of the watch maybe one of the most underrated scenes in sos is the revolt at krasters keep as men slay each other in an orgy of blind violence hatred panic fear and power gone mad watching the escalation was as good if not better than the book and the show captured the desparation of the nw counterposed with the villiany of craster and his desire to be left alone obviously the big moment was mormonts execution and the show delivered i really got a taste of just how horrible thsi world was by looking at them in that scene right asthe men were pushing craster to bring events to a head the excuse needed then to rape pillage and murder rymes with seek watching the ways a man can be broken is a complex mix of wonderment and pity i am amazed to the lengths with which the show will describe how theoin became reek but moreover the show is contoinuing with martins theme of trying to show how complicated theon is that while we may hate him we still dont have to like what is happeneing to him tywins family values a quick but toight scene with tywin writing and writing and cersei patiently waiting i loved how that scene showed just how little tywin needed to coddle his children he made very clear points cersei botched raising joff and now they are paying for it tywin has no problem giving cersei authority the question is though what is she really good for that scene encapsulates just how much tywin rules over all including the thoughts of his own children sophie turner she is portraying sansa to a t showing us the ideal of hope ina hopeless situation turners performance is nuanced captivating and real shes tremendous along came a spider maybe the hidden gem in this episode was varys the spider and how he slipped in and out of a host of tight talks with roz tyrion and ultimately olenna while olenna had the much better lines varys has the more progressive story arch hes up to something and its not as simple or as obvious as many think but when he and tyrion are talking he suddenly has a box and reveals to all just how horrible he can be and how much time patience and effort true revenge takes you know that this man is not fucking around he has the capacity to be as deadly as jaime the ultimate message tallyrand survived you may not if i have my way the fall of astapor once again there are maybe 12 scenes in each book that have to work or the show fails neds death the birth of dragons blackwater etc we just got the first of the season  danys trump of the slavers at astapor was a perfect highnote either we believe it and it works or we dont and danys story begins to crumble it was a tremendous scene not a blackwater but a absoilutely stunning show of brains greed intellect killer instinct tension and fierce hatred i thought that whole scvene from srart to finish was perfect as good as anything in the showbutwhat i am not sure onforeplay is there for a reason in the books while we all know dany will not give up her dragon as the scenes develop as each one lines up against the other a firsttime reader could easily be tricked into thinking that dany would give up drogon at least that she is considering giving him up there is ample buildup to some sort of inner turmoil between dany and her actions a mother possible foresaking her own child and in a book where the main character was killed in the first book not outside the realm of possibilities but in the show there is no doubt that dany is not going to give up the dragon i was watching it with a few nonbook readers and they all said that they knew she would never do it my feeling is that had the show invested one or two scenes of dany showing conflict worry concern dread fear etc any emotion it would have gone a long way in maybe tricking the viewer into thinking you know she may do this but they never invested that time so the moment was lost it was a simple paror trick nothing more in the book dany is really really nervous about the whole thing that fear of failure of crossing the trident is lost on the viewres i have no problem with dany being confident thats who she is but at least a little scared nervous how about uncertain all of those emotions could have been used to pantomime distaste for her own action of selling a dragon that could have been huge people watching the show may have thought this bitch may sell a dragon in ither words while that scene worked the overall arc was not as elegant as it could have been roses are still red while i love natalie dormer on the show i think we all understand her influence over joff cerseis fear and how they are moving i think the whole scene in balors sept could have been cut because it retreads covered ground whilei did not dislike the scene i like the history liked the cerseis fear and olennas quips its all rehashing stuff we already know even the scene with sansa felt overly long and after the olennavarys scene  unnecessary i am not saying its a fail just awkward what i did not likefor the second week in a row i have nothing to complain about i though it all looked great i thought they gave enough time to everything we wanted to see and experience unfortunately after next week were halfway done"

"Sun",2013-04-22,"what i am not sure onforeplay is there for a reason in the books while we all know dany will not give up her dragon as the scenes develop as each one lines up against the other a firsttime reader could easily be tricked into thinking that dany would give up drogon at least that she is considering giving him up there is ample buildup to some sort of inner turmoil between dany and her actions a mother possible foresaking her own child and in a book where the main character was killed in the first book not outside the realm of possibilities but in the show there is no doubt that dany is not going to give up the dragon i was watching it with a few nonbook readers and they all said that they knew she would never do it my feeling is that had the show invested one or two scenes of dany showing conflict worry concern dread fear etc any emotion it would have gone a long way in maybe tricking the viewer into thinking you know she may do this but they never invested that time so the moment was lost it was a simple paror trick nothing morein the book dany is really really nervous about the whole thing that fear of failure of crossing the trident is lost on the viewres i have no problem with dany being confident thats who she is but at least a little scared nervous how about uncertain all of those emotions could have been used to pantomime distaste for her own action of selling a dragon that could have been huge people watching the show may have thought this bitch may sell a dragonin ither words while that scene worked the overall arc was not as elegant as it could have beenthat hesitancy trepidation and fear should have been messaged to the audience in danys acting at the beginning of the scene her face and eyes should have shown her inner struggle unfortunately emilia is not a good enough actress to pull it off though she did try most markedly in the shot of her opening the dragon box"

"ShigellaSand",2013-04-22,"on the whole a brilliant episode sure a couple of minor things bugged me a little bit but they were just that  minor well played with theons regrets i thought isnt it so often the case that its when people are down and out that they start not only secondguessing themselves but also thinking about the ones who couldve helped them if only i kinda wished the scene hadnt been so very dark so i couldve seen his face better as he talked about balon and robb and ned and the millers boys  but then it soon became apparent why it had to be so dark in there great jaimebrienne scenes another step towards making show viewers see another side to jaime feel for him despite everything the look on briennes face when he started swaying in the saddle when they watered him when they kicked him as he was done powerful stuff and yeah maybe she wouldve chosen her words better if theyd been intended for a larger audience but she was speaking to jaime so she said what she thought would work on him made sense to me tywin and cersei simply brilliant all these lannisters play so wonderfully off each other their messedup family dynamics are a joy to behold such a gold mine for character building and it drives the plot so that nothing they do to each other really surprises you when you look back even if you didnt see it coming beforehand and of course joffrey is the absolutely perfect person to drop some background info about the more gruesome aspects of targaryen history and margaery is so sneaky while looking so innocent knowing exactly what to say to each person to make them do what she wants whether its joffrey or sansa varys and the queen of thorns in a scene together that alone wouldve made me like this episode from may i sit no all the way to it seems rather obvious to me that scene was pure gold they led up to the mycah accusation very well i think what with the talk of dead children and the hound rightly pointing out he wasnt responsible for them beric calling arya the bravest of them all seemed a little heavyhanded but ill allow it since it didnt cost him anything to say so and since he did respect her father a great deal so he might be willing to indulge a young girl whos been through a lot in the past year crasters ah mormont and so your watch is ended i did like the little detail about him asking where bonnen was from  being a good leader doesnt automatically mean he can remember everything about every single man under him dolorous edd got in a comment or two as well and sam got to be an infatuated boy with his foot firmly stuck in his mouth around gilly asking what the boys name was really talk about rubbing salt in wounds poor sweet thoughtless sam so wellmeaning but ah mormont you will be missed dracarys there was a little moment there when dany asked if the unsullied would follow her as free men and they started beating their spears on the ground where barristan and jorah exchanged looks just a look but it said so much at a moment like that their differences didnt mean anything it was all about dany wonderful end to a wonderful episode"

"WatcherontheRock",2013-04-23,"agreed the question is how far into season 4 will they do the purple wedding my bet is theyll pad out the first half of the season somewhat do the purple wedding around episode 67 so tyrions trial and eventual escape leads us to the privy scene in episode 9 i may be wrong what does everyone else thinki personnaly think it will happen earlier season 4 will not only be the second half of asos they will begin to dig into affc and adwd i would place it at the exact middle of the season tyrion arcs end will certainly be the privy scene episode 9 or even 10 i want tywin to die as late as possible but i dont think this will be the high point of the season it is in the books but not in the sense of the rw the death of tywin unleashes further chaos in the realm but no one realises it immediately this my great question for season 4  what will be the great moment after neds beheading blackwater and obviously the rw  i really dont know"
"WatcherontheRock",2013-04-23,"for the episode in itself that was close to perfection i wont repeat what so many of you already said 1 for locations  the sept is awesome and i havent noticed but in the opening credits the twins are already here when they go from riverrun to winterfell interesting 2 for images  the atmosphere in crasters keep was just fantastic the lights and of course the actions were the perfect match 3 for varys  i love him but his scene with the sorcerer felt a bit odd varys does nothing without purpose and he certainly doesnt reveal his personnal life so was it a way to show the bond between varys and tyrion and prepare the privy scene and even something more only grrm and dd know i hope so his meeting with olenna was great and his interaction with lf always fascinating by the way i do not predict a long life for ros lf hates those who try to play with him except varys 4 i dont distrust you because youre a woman i distrust you because youre not as smart as you think you are well tywin you distrust her because you dont have to trust her you are the boss a boss doesnt trust love the way he said all right contribute subtext  speak your part and let me write my letter to my old friend walder frey alone tywins scenes are very well constructed and now we know that cersei and tyrion are on the same level with him which is a very low one and of course who cant wait to see tywin finally meet his grandson joffrey needs a sharp lesson 5 i was for the second time of the show impressed by brienne but this time in an emotional way youre a bloody woman that line is fantastic and the way she treats jaime is great shes really a great character and christie a great actress 6 we finally meet ramsay great scene with the look in the end reminded me of frodo in mount doom smart move besides from dd  joffrey will progressively fade until he chokes and by the time well have his replacement and ramsay is a deal madder than joffrey 7 the last branch of the seven pointed star  daenerys of course absolutely brilliant there is nothing to drop dracarys of course and the unsullied but the looks his speech in valyrian the look of amazementrelishdelight on mormonts and selmys face and the very final shot even the music was great in the top 5 of all the series only two less good scenes  bran too short it just felt they wanted us to remind he existed arya the scene was good but i dont think they fully succeeded in the introduction of beric but im sure the trial of next week will erase this hesitation and ive seen episode 5 preview well finally really meet roose i expect a lot of this scene boltons silence was a hundred times more threatening than lockes slobbering malevolence"

"Lyana",2013-04-23,"well that was a great episode i only voted 9 cause i know the show can do even better in the next episodes and it probably would the final scenes were epic i finally get that feeling that i am watching a big production with a decent budget the blackwater episode was impressive but the dracarys scene was really something i was looking for i def got goosebumps the episode had definitely a strong and emotional beginning seeing jaime defeated and desperate was a call back to reality he realizes he cannot always count on his fathers name and here enters brienne an returns him the favor trying to make him angry and wake the will to live in him it was emotional scene  sad but somehow beautiful  representing perfectly the dynamic between the two characters i was wondering the whole time what was varys actually doing with the box while talking to tyrion i knew he was up to something but wasnt expecting  that i guess there isnt any special meaning behind this deviation from the book story it was just supposed to give the viewers the feeling that varys is a dangerous guy indeed and he can wait as long as it takes to achieve his purposes and from the looks if tyrion i would say he was rather impressed too the tension at the nw has started to build up slowly since the previous episode we see the minor gestures and statements which lead us to thing this apple has rotten from the inside long time ago of course in the book the hunger and desperation were almost real but the show did its best too hunger and fear do make people go crazy the nights watch has fallen  not at the wall but there in crasters keep and so did mormont  his watch has ended i know that there are so many characters this season but brans story line seems really unimportant and somehow distant we get to see him for a minute pro episode and people are still confused about the reeds it is somehow sad because i have the feeling he has the most important role to play later the dream of catelyn was some kind of foreshadowing i guess we all know whats coming the sansa plot is more obvious than in the books and i find that understandable i really enjoyed the varys quality time in this episode he is the best i cant recall one thing though  why was ross so willing to spy for him margaery is the new sweetheart i love her interaction with joffrey and jack gleeson is an outstanding actor  probably one of the best in the show his fear from the common people was almost surreal and than the insecure waving to the crowd  he nailed it the sept of baelor was impressive also we learned some brief history lessons and got to see cersei truly worried  priceless poor theon his confession about ned stark was heartbreaking theons story is somehow really tragic but also showing how ones life could be truly affected from early stages my nonbook reader friends still dont feel pity for him but i guess it would all come later aaaaand finally cersei got her as spanked she deserved it and from her fathers mouth it was really impressive to see how tiwyn holds his children  only with one word gesture or look he does not have power  he is the power and the thin irony was also spot on  he is criticizing cersei about not being able to handle her own son but yet he failed tremendously in the proper upbringing of his own children and only the sound of the letter writing just got me chills the olenna scenes are really refreshing i was surprised to see how varys was not prepared for her honesty at the beginning of the conversation but he then soon got his confidence back those were some really good lines i was really enjoying the scene and than the related one with sansa and margaery was also fine they are so different but still willing to be friends  two beautiful little girls in the middle of the cruel game of thrones was it said explicitly in the show that loras is in the kings guard cause that makes the marriage proposal without any real meaning sansa wouldnt have fallen for that otherwise the slightly change was ok we dont need another new character to remember we wont be seeing enough of arya this season i guess but im looking forward to hear some prophecies im not sure if they will include the ghost of high heart or they will just make thoros to see something in the flames though as i have already stated the final scene was epic the minor complaint was just that we really didnt think dany would actually sell drogon some more suspense couldnt have hurt but its fine also i hope we get to see more consistent appearances by each character not one scene pro episode edited spelling edited by lyana 23 april 2013  0457 pm"

"HopeForSpring",2013-04-24,"i think they have some constraints because of dealing with real people with real acting careers they have to give more scenes to the actors they do have and are important  like varys like theon  so they can keep them around for the indefinite number of years this might take so we end up with scenes that arent in the book like varys and qot meanwhile actors that are seen in the first season and then not again until many seasons later  like mago  might as well kill them of in case the actor isnt around i didnt like what they did to the night watch at all no sam the slayer no holding of mormonts head but in general they are doing a tough job of collapsing characters really well"

"mafalda",2013-04-25,"i hope it will be in there i think some of it has to be but like the rest of this season i think they will cut it dramatically short remember first jon has to have his love affair with ygritte who we hopefully see naked love redheads even though she is grimy then he has to assualt their camp bran warging or whatever as summer assisting and then jon escapes to defend castle black if they do it right this should extend over a few episodes anyone know if there are only 10 episodes this season i wish they could make it 13 but i guess the budget for this show is probably pretty outraegous to begin with people who think that joffrey will be killed this season are sorely mistaken and who knows what else they will change how they end up doing the bran scenes from adwd is anyones guess i would think a lot of computer graphics and what not would be necessary the whole sansa plot is unfolding strangely too i dont see who is going to play the part of dontos and i really dont think her marriage to tyrion will take place this season i also have no idea who will give her the veil of death possibly the queen of thorns just to take all the speculation from the books out which they seem to like to do these days as far as stannis defending castle black we dont even know where melissandre is going that was never in the book so who knows it would be pretty hard for them to just leave that out i would thinkwhy do you think tyrion and sansas wedding wont happen this season i hope it will its one of the bigger storylines from asosunfortunately there are only 10 eps this season the episode titles have been posted and i think 8 is titled the bear and maiden fair which leads me to think tyrion and sansas wedding will take place during that epi kind of hope that they will have ros fill the role of dontos since she is lfs right hand man anyway or woman then i hope he does ros just like he did dontos and off her im sorry i am not a fan of her character and this little deal she has with varys she was ok first season didnt care for her second season now im just over heri wish they had more episodes too we only get it once a year too but i understand it must cost a fortune to make this show also does anyone here know anything abut cgi and why its so expensive"

"shiola",2013-04-24,"when it was first brought up last week i was sure it had some sort of plot relevance i thought maybe the whores got pod to let something important slip since he is with tyrion a lottyrion trusts himetc and therefore he didnt have to pay because they used him so when tyrion and bronn asked pod for details and to tell them everything i thought tyrion wanted to listen to see if pod fucked up somehow but then coming on here i realized it was just a joke as a reader i think i just over analyze things this is the show not the books which i have to constantly remind myself and on the show there can be throw away scenes things just for comic relief etc whereas in the books almost everything has some sort of underlying message i dont know why ros and varys were talking about it it seems like the joke is played out at this point but maybe the writers like it but i dont think theres any underlying meaning anymore and its not foreshadowing or a hint theyre building up pods character so we care more about when he is taken by uncat and they are doing it in a way that they find humorous thats my take in a longwinded explanation"

"Lord of the Tides",2013-04-25,"that made me laugh so muchbut yeah i find it hard to believe that they turned a character who was pretty much sexlessasexual in the books into a sex god just as a throwaway joke i hope there is more to it did someone else pay without roz knowledge are they building him up to become a love interest for sansa he did have a crush on her in the books or something like that or do they just think it will make him more interestingits going to be weird now when hell share a bedroom with briennei am not too sure if someone else paying would make any sense in this case since tyrion is already this someone else for pod why overcomplicate things i also doubt much info can be got from pod i mean he has trouble spitting out things he wants to say let alone something he might consider a secret and on that note does he know any secrets really or does tyrion even have any secrets at this stage his scenes with cercei seem to suggest she considers him done now that daddy is in town and even if podrick knew something and did tell the whores surely they would just take his money anywaythe brienne journey should have something to do with it but i doubt dd would move away from the book plot so much as to suggest a romance there it would kinda ruin brienneâs character since she would be asking uncat to spare them not for some poor random innocent boyâs life but for someone who threw a leg over her once or twice sounds kinda cheep  jaime deserves better"

"ugashep",2013-04-24,"i think margaery was portrayed as clever in the books she is just younger she is also not pov in the books so you dont get inside her head but i definately got the impression in the books that she could handle herself and that she was the protege of the queen of thorns i think the show is pretty consistent with that natalie dormer is very magnetic in her portrayal to hottest girl on the show to me but im in my 30s and i can dig her a lot easier than some of the younger girls edited by ugashep 24 april 2013  0324 pm"

"PhoenixFlame",2013-04-24,"margaery is awesome in the show i dont think its her fault she has similar traits in the tudors plus ann boleyn was manipulative and sly but she didnt keep henry whipped for long her character could not adapt to that and had problems controlling her temperseason 2 was a downward spiral margaerys more of a schemer she doesnt just string joffrey along and make him crazy about her she makes him outright behave granted if events turned out differently margaery could have lost control of joff but shes not just pulling the keep him wanting more card also i think dormer strikes a great balance between manipulativeness and kindness you know shes calculating and always choosing the best tool for the job but she comes across as so nice its great how she can go between them edited by phoenixflame 24 april 2013  0450 pm"

"Warhawk137",2013-04-25,"i like tvmargaery for essentially the same reason i like talisa oddly enough the problem adapting a book to television or film is that the storytelling mechanism is different grrm in writing the books particularly using the rotating pov format is perfectly able to include characters who on one hand are important to the plot but on the other still remain in the background and arent heavily developed because the plotimportant stuff can easily get across via another character pov cant really do that in a medium like television or film in this medium a plotimportant character is generally going to need scenes where they take the spotlight to get across that importance and thus a direct transferral of that character from book to screen isnt going to work you just cant get away with putting a character whos basically a blank slate in the books onto the screen asis obviously the response to the changes in regards to margaery have been better received but in regards to talisa while i understand why some people just dont care much for her character in general i have to ask  what was so captivating about jeyne westerling that makes the change so undesirable there are inanimate objects in the books that get more characterization than jeyne westerling but i digress i like the changes to margaery but more than that i absolutely love how dormer is pulling off the character as that character has been adapted for television shes hit all the right notes its the perfect role for her"

"teemo",2013-04-25,"i guess im the minority here but i actually prefer bookmargaeryi always thought that margaery was playing the game in the books but we didnt know how well she could play we didnt know how much was cerseis imagination and how much was real i often found myself questioning her actions i would ask myself why is she riding horses so often and so long does she really care about sansa or the orphans is she really a virgin is she fucking loras i guess loras had something with renly but could it be i dont know maybe cerseis paranoia is contagious but there was this compelling mistery about margaerythis is exactly how i felt one second i thought i had her figured out the next i wasnt so sure that was fun if i saw the show first id suspect all that intrigue would be gone"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-04-25,"margaery in the books is studious cunning and ruthless and very much her grandmotherintraining we dont get any sense of her using sexual allure to manipulate either joffrey and tommenin the tv series both joffrey and margaery are aged up as neither is a pov in the booksthey need to have scenes created for them margaery is clearly sexually experienced and is able to manipulate joffrey accordingly and her ambition is made very obviouswhats weird is im not sure that shes really using sex at all its possible joffrey is such damaged goods that a sexual woman really doesnt attract him all that much absent some brutalityi think what shes really offering joffrey is validation and fake admiration from an intelligent femalehe knows shes smart shes older but rather than treating him in that manner that his mother does she basically affirms how great he is by showing interest in the things in which he is interested sansa just said words to the effect that he was wonderful margaery however showed actual interest when his violent sadistic streak came out as he was describing the crossbow its like hes the psychopath who has found his likeminded partnerher gender matters of course but i think primarily in the sense that he previously had such disdain for women that finding a woman who actually he thinks sees the world the way he does is a good fortune he never expected"
"shiola",2013-04-25,"i love the tyrells i loved them in the books and hated that they arent pov characters so the fact that the show is handling them so well and is showing them to be as clever as i always assumed they were is wonderful more marg scenes please"
"Theda Baratheon",2013-04-25,"whats weird is im not sure that shes really using sex at all its possible joffrey is such damaged goods that a sexual woman really doesnt attract him all that much absent some brutalityi think what shes really offering joffrey is validation and fake admiration from an intelligent femalehe knows shes smart shes older but rather than treating him in that manner that his mother does she basically affirms how great he is by showing interest in the things in which he is interested sansa just said words to the effect that he was wonderful margaery however showed actual interest when his violent sadistic streak came out as he was describing the crossbow its like hes the psychopath who has found his likeminded partnerher gender matters of course but i think primarily in the sense that he previously had such disdain for women that finding a woman who actually he thinks sees the world the way he does is a good fortune he never expectedwhats weird is im not sure that shes really using sex at all its possible joffrey is such damaged goods that a sexual woman really doesnt attract him all that much absent some brutalityi think what shes really offering joffrey is validation and fake admiration from an intelligent femalehe knows shes smart shes older but rather than treating him in that manner that his mother does she basically affirms how great he is by showing interest in the things in which he is interested sansa just said words to the effect that he was wonderful margaery however showed actual interest when his violent sadistic streak came out as he was describing the crossbow its like hes the psychopath who has found his likeminded partnerher gender matters of course but i think primarily in the sense that he previously had such disdain for women that finding a woman who actually he thinks sees the world the way he does is a good fortune he never expectedthis is effectively my view on it aswell yes shes an attractive woman but i felt it was the approval and the false flattery and admiration that joffrey loves especially when hes doing something particularly sadistic as youve mentioned the crossbow and also his laughing over dead targs when marg laughs too and flatters and admires him this is what is winning him over"
"Dove",2013-04-25,"yeah her manipulation of joff is only sexual in the vaguest sense in a way the whole point is that it isnt sexual and she knows that the prostitutes last season learned the hard way that that shit dont fly with him shes picked up on the fact that it wouldnt work on joffrey at all so shes appealing to other facets of his personality in clever ways because she knows how to read people and use the knowledge shes learned from others too margaery is awesomeive seen the first two seasons of the tudors so i get the similarity complaints i guess but sorry i cant hear yall over the sounds of my swooning for natalie dormer edited by chareth cutestory 25 april 2013  0214 pm"

"PhoenixFlame",2013-04-25,"yeah its part of her charm that her sexiness toward joff doesnt involve sex despite the crossbow insinuations she dresses in a way most dudes would drool over but he becomes more interested in her when she talks to him and shares his interests whats also interesting is she has him trusting her like when he followed her out onto the steps of the sept for a brief moment he looked totally lost and nervous it had the secondary effect of proving margaery knows better than cersei  the peasants dont all want to rip his throat out  so he has even less reason to listen to mommy dearestoh jack gleeson comments on the joffmarg relationship hes so adorable"

"Trident full of Dogs",2013-04-23,"seemed one of the more varys centric episodes of the series so far we got two backstory monologues one about his castration the other about growing up a thief and later met with the queen of thornsalso controversially i will imagine we got a reveal that varys keeps the sorcerer who castrated him ritualistically in a small box in his room that was pretty unexpected theres been a lot of theories over the years about is varys possibly not even a eunuch maybe his whole backstory is bunk and something else is going on ie blackfyres so this would appear to make it pretty concrete then again all we saw was a shivered old man with his mouth gagged it doesnt have to be who varys said he wasnevertheless i thought conleth hill one of my favorite actors on the show continued to do fine workwhat if varys is an unsullied and his story is a cover up i wonder if someone else is his master and he only obeys"

"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-04-26,"i thought the scene was adequate mormont being awesome was too far split up in contrast to his death as in he was really likable in season 1 with jon and then we get his death after doing not much besides leading his men to a bloodbath and then quickly retreating so there wasnt a sense that he was really a great guy before he died i did however like how he casually turns to rast and completely owns him before dying but i dont think it was as emotional as it couldve been not due to the this one scene but due to his overall portrayal until that moment that being said the dying words would have been beyond ridiculous on tv it was always sort of ridiculous in the books since that whole event is supposed to be chaotic and theres no way sam shouldve been able to survive it"

"Shadow on the Wall",2013-04-27,"i thought it was a really good scene because it was realistic in real life especially with criminals shit can go down real fast and theres really nothing you can do about it except fight run away or die the foreshadowing came mainly from knowing what the nights watch had been through rather than specific scenes  and it meant the audience would have been as surprised as mormont was in the context of the realism i dont think mormonts last words would have worked would most likely have come across as cheesy and contrived"

"SnowStorm",2013-04-23,"this scene reminded me of the theory that varys is a secret targaryenblackfyre im not a huge fan of the theory but it struck me as an odd coincidence for varys to talk about his story and the spell in this episode after mel had mentioned the kings blood spell in the last one"
"aedalia",2013-04-24,"i thought this scene was interesting since it showed that varys is about the long game he waited im guessing 30 years to get revenge on the sorcerer it shows that him waiting around for dany to grow up is completely within character it was also intersting to me since part of me always thought he lied in the books about how he was cut i thought maybe he was an escapee unsullied edited by aedalia 24 april 2013  0107 pm"

"Bayard",2013-04-21,"trying to pinpoint what language it might sound likeit almost sounds romanianwell this made me curious i am romanian i listened to it again it still sounds a little greek to me smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  but not romanian smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  sorryi disagree with your criticism astapor is a megacity in bravosian terms this was simply one private merchant and his 8000 man army astapor as an entire city has more armed men than that he the astapori slaver had never been in a position to sell his entire army before because he had never been in an opportunity to buy a live dragon  which is worth more than 108000 men armies and he was consumed with the lust for power that the ownership of a dragon brings so he readily agreed believing he was getting the better of the deal why isnt it believable  people in fits of lust do all kinds of things he didnt even presume she spoke valyrian to him she was just a dumb westerosi whorebitch who was fruitlessly trying to get her kingdom back she might conquer some little cities along the way  but astapor  oh no and look at what she did  she conquered him and his direct part of astapor  she didnt go after the entire city as a matter of fact  she then immediately left the city so i find it entirely plausible and believablesorry but you are wrong it wasnt just one slaver all the unsullied traders gathered to pull that number of soldiers its written in the book that when it comes to unsullied there arent different trainers they all do it combined they have a standard to do it so dany was really buying all of the astapors soldiers they had some personal guards but not unsullied as they said it wasnt wise to mix them with the other slavesto everyonesure sorry but no i refuse to believe that any slaver could be so willfully blind to the idea that a buyer particularly one from outside the regular paradigm would ever try to cross them it defies my suspension of belieflike i said im totally willing to buy into the idea that they wouldnt understand a dragon cant be sold im also willing to buy the idea that they underestimate dany they clearly do and sure im willing to buy that unsullied cant be trained to not obey whatever order their master gives me and of course im willing to buy that they would do just about anything for a dragonwhat im not willing to buy is that would not always have enough other soldiersslave soldiers on hand to properly defend the city as is its like a gun store owner selling a gun and bullets to someone and not having a shotgun behind the counter in case the customer gets any ideasthink about the context this is astapor they have absolutely no enemy since the fall of valyria the ghiskari cities dont fight one another like the free cities they are at peace theyve been selling these unsullied to the free cities and their wars for centuries why would he imagine that she would attack them its completely unheard of and were not talking about a single trader in the books there is a council of slavers none of them imagine that she could do such a dishonorable thing volantis could have been a threat but they have been ruled by the elephants for a long time and the dothraki dont attack the 3 cities in slavers bay because that is where they sell of their slaves that is why its so easy for yunkai to make a huge alliance against dany shes not only fighting against slavery but she broke the most important rule that governs their life a fair trade"
"ExileOnDaytonStreet",2013-04-22,"i thought it was a damn near perfect scene in an excellent episode things are destined to be condensed since each season is a mere 10 episodes so i loved how much detail was thrown into this one scene everything from missandeis little jaw drop right when dany starts speaking valyrian to the looks between barristan and jorah the way she tested her army before commencing with operation be a total badass i loved it alldont feed the trollto be fair the way some people gripe about any and all changes made in adapting the books to the screen i kind of cant blame others for taking the troll seriously in this case"
"sennahoj",2013-04-22,"emotionally i found danys speech to the slaves the best part of that scene had me tearing up a little bit for some reason the effects were topnotch but they were just the icing on the cake what really sold the scene to me was emilias performance especially the seemingly effortless way in which she delivered her valyrian lines"

"Sand Snake of Dorne",2013-04-22,"people talking about how dumb kraznys and the slavemasters were youre missing an important historical point one that is crucial to understand the whole dany arch george martin brings a modern slavery vision into the story through the eyes of dany she sees slavery and thinks the way we would she thinks its terrible unbearable this can be justified by the fact that she spent her entire life hiding and running and doesnt really know a thing about life or war and also is kind of heart its very clear how mildly all other characters look to slavery in the books the slaves themselves have a problem with being free in many cases they dont know what to do with this new society she builds and they want the old order to return in the books after this event not all of them of course and of course many people come to agree with her point of view but it is very confusing either way she brings something nobody never imagined it could be thats why unsullied werent trained no to attack their previous masters thats why its not dangerous to sell 8000 unsullied to one person why on earth would somebody free them why would anybody attack astapor i dont really remember if its astapor but one of this slave cities its described as not having any kind of physical defense whatsoever because why on earth would somebody attack slave traders it would be the same as killing blacksmiths ou sellswords  theyre often essential to war westeros is clearly different for banning slavery but as jorah arch proves slavery is not all that far away from westeros and westerosis minds ps sorry bout any spelling mistakes english is not my mother tongue"

"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2013-04-22,"i have a problem with this plot line because how can it be that presumably in season 4 and beyond that nobody knows where sansa stark is including varys if varys and qot knows that lf plotted to absond with her now wouldnt the vale be the first place they would look when she disappears knowing lfs intentions the reason nobody suspected lf is because he never contacted her directly and nobody had any clue that he was interested in her"

"thegreatwhitebear",2013-04-23,"personally i think the others awakening after so long is what may have reintroduced magic back into the world if you look at the series of events their presence was what we first find out about however i know that dragons until recently have only been extinct for what 150 yrs or so and that may have been only bc of the maesters at the citadel"

"ExileOnDaytonStreet",2013-04-22,"i have to disagree with a few criticisms of the theonboy scenes and how much information is revealed in them although i can see others have hit my main points for me hereits important to not give away too much about who boy is since doing too much there would take away from the impact that the rw can have it doesnt matter how it was set up in the books as much as many people who post here consider such a thought to be sacrilege it matters how this plays out as part of serialized television this season will have people talking in a way that will make neds execution look like childs play and that was a moment that if it hadnt been based off of a preexisting book wouldve been one of the most bold and daring moves wed ever seen in scripted televisionall that said the flayed man sigil that boltons men carry its been most prominently displayed by the bolton bannermen that captured jaime and brienne is echoed in the torture room so you know that there are some subtle throwaways that will reward nonbookreaders when they look back on this on dvdim glad people are enjoying this storyline sure by its nature you have to invent scenes that technically arent in the books but for how much of nothing theons going to be doing for a few seasons its nice to keep him fresh on the viewers minds my only complaint about this is the character takes a journey to end up in the same spot trope which i dislike in any tv show lost was the worst with that oneokay my other complaint is that i wish they wouldve waited a few more episodes before bringing theon back into the series episode 5 or 6 maybe as much as i like giving theon more to do when adapting books that hes largely absent from i liked the idea that there would be some suspense in wondering what happened to him postwinterfell even morealfie allen is great on this show one of its secret stars and this episode was no exception excellently played and i think the writers have done well by theons inner turmoilthat shiteating smirk on iwan rheons face when he lit the torch was beautifully played he was wellcast for ramsay imo edited by exileondaytonstreet 22 april 2013  1222 am"

"Bolton's Bastard",2013-04-22,"why in the books he definitely knew where he was not saying that its bad because its different than the books i just think its badly handled on its ownwell to be fair in the book he was backhanded by ramsay and later i assume woke up in the dreadfort here he was knocked out by his men and handed over so he wouldnt have any idea the torturers were also wearing ironborn uniform ramsay just fed him bogus info ride east so he probably just rode a bit east of the dreadfort lost his bearings in the chase and ramsay lead him back to the dreadfort via a different route"

"gibbles545",2013-04-22,"i was a bit worried when we first met boy because he was not pulling off a crazy or sadistic look at all an he is obviously more handsome than book ramsay but the look he gave theon as he was put back on the rack was very sinister and him being handsome may make it more shocking for none book readers so im slightly hopeful now"
"Delmas",2013-04-22,"love theon but i thought the boltons were unaware of the starks boys being alive the fact that theon told ramsay about themso quickly makes theon looks moronic and ramsay look like einstein imo"

"BananaSpice",2013-04-22,"yeah affc and adwd plotlines will surely start by the end of season 4  i have no idea why people think theon is going to be tortured for 3 seasons and all that nonsense no the show is not the books  things are going to move chronologically"

"Crown",2013-04-22,"the only father i knew was beheaded in kings landinggive alfie an emmy for that line perfect he almost made me shed a manly tear"
"Nudu",2013-04-22,"did i ever say he burned down winterfell his actions lead to that happening but he also beheaded the men he once served with and had two chidlren killed theon doesnt deserve sympathy he was taken away from a father who is a diguisting peron he was given a good life in winterfell he was raised as a lord right along side every stark child and was treated better then jon snow i dont see jon killing children and betraying his family theon is a pathetic person who is desperatly seeking approval because of his own shortcomings he deserves everything that is coming to him plain and simple go watch the stark children screaming and crying as he beheaded ser rodrick as he whacks and slices and kicks his head off go watch that and tell me he deserves any form of sympathy he was given everything and threw it all away because he was jealouse of his sister mr rodrick should have known he should not spit on his captors face"
"BananaSpice",2013-04-22,"i also think its an important distinction that the awful things theon does are always at the prodding of other people no thats not an excuse  he is still culpable but it does show that he isnt inherently evil i mean joffrey and ramsay and gregor clegane just like to be violent and cruel  nobody needs to encourage them to do so theon absolutely does not want to be cruel or evil he wants to be a good leader he tries to be a good leader  he tries to be like ned stark  he thinks about how hes protecting the north from the likes of him ie ramsay disguised as reek when he encourages flaying and theon refuses to allow tortureflaying while hes in charge theon also wrestles with the guilt as early as his acok chapters im just really not sure which books the haters have been reading lol"
"Lord Martin",2013-04-22,"so badass my theory is that theon will be tortured for the rest of the season about the whereabouts of bran and rickon theon obviously doesnt know and his lack of answers wont make his captors happy then ramsay snow will be revealed as rooses son right around the time of the rw my guess is one episode before so its a hint but not a big one part of my theory is that brans story line is not detailed enough compared to many others its just his band walking walking and walking some more doesnt make great tv my theory is that next season will be ramsay and co hunting down bran and rickon that might be what causes them to split up by that time i expect theon to be ramsays maimed lap dog as for this whole deserving torture business deserve is a loaded word what do any of us deserve the point isnt what does theon deserve imo martin makes his torture so awful just to test the readers limits the point is theon must be tortured so he can be redeemed"
"Toxspecific",2013-04-22,"theon that convo was so sad pretty darn heartbreaking the only father i had lost his head in kings landing and what makes it sadder is that ned did not could not for his own sake consider theon a son damn absolutely magnificent scene top class acting and legendary characterization at work i feel honoured to have watched that scene"

"Versiroth",2013-04-22,"i just rewatched the scene and honestly i think that theyre just setting up the fact that ramsey is vile and cruel he got off on other peoples pain in the books and this was just the first taste of what hes like to the nonbook readers theyll get who he really is eventually and also that theons pain and suffering has only just begun the fact that theon made some heart felt and apologetic revelations this episode will only deepen the sorrow the audience will feel as hes tortured and broken"

"Dove",2013-04-22,"theres a pretty big difference between saying poor poor theon is totally justified in everything he did because he made me sad sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  and i can see where hes coming from and what led up to his decisions also whoa literally nobody deserves the horrific fate he went through duder its hard to not have sympathy for a character who goes through two years of constant physical and mental torture gets his teeth broken his fingers flayed and mutilated etc thats not justice by any definition of the word especially not when its being done by someone like ramsay snow"
"BananaSpice",2013-04-22,"yeah theon wasnt justified in many things he did it could be argued that he was justified in betraying the starks bc it was for his own bloodfamilyhouse  but he obviously realizes that was a stupid decision or at least he went about it the wrong way by trying to take winterfell and be a stark and a greyjoy its different to say that we understand why he did what he did due to his unfortunate background  situation hes simply a ridiculously sympathetic character even before adwd yes he has a bit of an attitude but i feel like it comes across as a defense mechanism hes terrified of looking bad  always trying to save face if you cant sympathize with him after adwd then  i just dont know i have no words lol edit i feel like the theon haters just want mary sue characters tbh dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno  edited by jenthehen 22 april 2013  0309 pm"

"Tadco26",2013-04-22,"i get the need to show what happened to theon since the show doesnt do flashbacks and there is no internal monologue that being said im not sure if i like what they decided to show its just not clear what the point of letting theon go and then killing four bolton men just to recapture him was yes ramsay ended up learning about bran and rickon but that was completely voluntary confession which was more luck than planned at the very door of the dungeon room as others have commented we have no clue on where theon started and where he ended up he headed east and that makes one presume the dreadfort but leaves the question of where did he start and why wouldnt theon know that deepwood motte is in the west on the coast making it impossible for any castle to be west of it did he really go in a big circle i would have preferred the escape scene theon remembers from the book with kyra letting him go and ramsays dogs hunting them down maybe we will still get it but it seems a bit unlikely to have two escapes the other thing i noticed is that ramsays explanation and personality when he said that he brought theon back and that theon had killed the other 4 came across as subordinate like he was explaining himself to a higher authority figure"
"AliKat",2013-04-22,"edit i feel like the theon haters just want mary sue characters tbh dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno but theon wasnt really a nice guy before he invaded winterfell its not like that was his only misdeed just talking about show verse theon think about how he treated people especially women like old nan called her an the old bat to her face roughing up ros and threatening osha he talked a lot of smack he wasnt a good person the only redeeming quality he had in my mind was rescuing bran from the wildlingsand think about it robb stark was the one person that trusted theon none of the northererns or other starks did his own father and sister didnt trust him robb trusted him and theon stabbed him in the backi do feel bad that he gets tortured but at the same time he wasnt an innocent victim in all that"
"Mammothsbane",2013-04-22,"that scene was the only time in my soiaf life ive felt bad for theon alfie did a great job"

"AliKat",2013-04-22,"in the show and the books he is super remorseful and doubts himself all the time and thats just not something you see from an evil characterbut was he remorseful because he lost and got tortured if he was still in power at winterfell and running the show not being tortured and what not  he wouldnt be remorseful its easy to regret your actions when you end up getting punished for them its a different story to regret them and feel remorse while youre still benefitting from it"
"BananaSpice",2013-04-22,"ok i just keep repeating myself over and over bc ppl obviously arent reading the entire thread theon regrets his actions during acok not just bc he was tortured  lost no one can convince me that he was treated better than jon snow jon snow would never have been killed in winterfell for any reason and only catelyn was resentful towards him everyone resented or was distant from theon except for robb and on occasion ned who tried to play the father but also kept his distance bc he may have had to kill him in a lot of theons povs acok and adwd he remembers being afraid as a hostage especially at first he has an epiphany near the end of acok in which he realizes that hes always felt the noose around his neck how could a child not be afraid in his situation i refuse to believe that he was just oh yeah whatever about being a hostage its absurd"
"Minsc",2013-04-22,"but theon was treated better than jon in the book as far as status went theon was still son of a lord jon was the bastard son of a lord who sat in the back of the great hall rather than with the other high born kidsactually besides the rare occurrence of him being able to sit at the high table with the king it is remembered that jon received better treatment which is not surprising seeing how he was raised as almost an equal son of lord ned stark whom the entire north loved while theon was the son of the traitor and despised balon greyjoy whose people are a constant threat to the homelands of the north and riverlands moreover jon at least has the ability to bond with ned and the stark kids by his being related to them by blood in contrast ned kept his distance from theon because someday he might have to execute theon for his fathers crimes furthermore there is the wide age gap between theon and the various stark kids with robb and jon being the only ones not almost a decade younger then theon which hampers ones ability to really connect with someone when you are that young"
"Versiroth",2013-04-22,"but was he remorseful because he lost and got tortured if he was still in power at winterfell and running the show not being tortured and what not  he wouldnt be remorseful its easy to regret your actions when you end up getting punished for them its a different story to regret them and feel remorse while youre still benefitting from itin the books he showed remorse during some of his inter monologues at winterfell for the deaths he caused there he also didnt harm bran or rickon theon is a character that never truly belongs any where and always tries to over compensate he also is always making the wrong decisions normally based on how he wants others to approve of him theon makes horrible choices through out the series but he was never a truly evil character deserving of the torture he received heck people love jaime and all he ever truly was was a douche heck so far he was captured and imprisoned which he deserved he was crippled which he also deserved bran and he was also cut off by cersi which is his sister other than saving brienne what has he done that makes him so endearing to everyone"

"Ramsay Gimp",2013-04-22,"quick question so now does ramsay know that bran and rickon are alive he seemed kinda shocked when he heard theon say soyes unlike in the novels where it is actually ramsays idea to kill the boys ramsay in the show really thought theon had killed the two princes when he captured him edited by ramsay gimp 22 april 2013  1021 pm"

"MarieAntoinette",2013-04-22,"anyhoo i am really enjoying the ramsay scenes so farin the books there was a sexual element to the way ramsay tortured reek i wonder if were going to see any of that in the hbo showpersonally i hope they dont go too much in this direction there is already some fanart shipping ramsay  reek out there and i dislike this approach because i think the story of theon breaking down physically and mentally and becoming reek is so horrible i feel that if there are too many hints that point to a twisted sexual relationship the tragic story of theons transformation might not come across as it should i really dont want this to turn into a lets watch how sexy halfnaked theon gets tortured on the cross kind of thinganyhow i think that the actor playing ramsay was really creepy in some of his scenes in episode 4 he probably is a good choice to play ramsay after all despite not looking like i imagined ramsey from reading the books tv theon is more likeable than book theon so far in the book he seemed to be such an arrogant jerk his comment on eddard being his real father made him much more sympathetic to me"
"Bolton's Bastard",2013-04-23,"does anyone know if theon ever spoke that line about his real father being ned in any of the books i remember thinking that to myself but i cant recall theon ever sayingthinking those words exactlyi dont think that he does but he does have a moment with ultimately the same effect in adwd when hes climbing the steps to winterfells great hall i think and he thinks about how he should have died with robb"

"Cas Stark",2013-04-23,"hey all im new to these forums but love the discussion here i have a question about the theonramsay scenes from episode 23 just a heads up dont worry if you spoil anything for me as ive already read through the entire got wiki pagesi understand from season 2 roose bolton sent ramsay to winterfell to retake the ciry from theon roose mentioned to robb that his bastard son was almost at winterfell in season 2 now im assuming the army of northmen who surrounded theon and eventually burned down winterfel was lead by ramsay under rooses instructionshere is where i get confused why did ramsay free theon from being tortured save him from being captured again only to lead him to another location to be tortured he was already being tortured by ramsays men wasnt he to begin with wasnt he in winterfell when he was being tortured the first time im really confused about all of thisthanks in advanceno he was being tortured at the dreadfort he is back in exactly the same place he was taken fromx marks the spot ramsey does it because he likes to play mind games and he wants to break theon mentally so in future theon will expect any escape plans are something that ramsey is behind and will have no hope of success"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-04-23,"the fact that ramsey knows about branrickon and yet does nothing to try to find them and make sure they do not return to claim their birthright baffles me granted theyre kids and therefore he probably doesnt consider them a threat but they wont stay kids forever and everyone in the north knows  the north rallies to the starks whether its eddard robb bran rickon sansa etc the northmen marched in the snow for weeks to save arya i dont remember in the books if roose knows branrickon are alive but i feel like if he did hed have them hunted down well its kind of a dual edged sword because everyone in the north believes them to be dead as long as that is the case then robbs defeat leaves the north without a ruler and it is easier for roose to consolidate his power and position as warden but if they start sending out search parties for bran and rickon then word will leak out that they arent dead and thats going to make it harder for rooseplus word of them hasnt popped up anywhere so theres always the possibility that even though they escaped winterfell they really are dead"

"Pinkie Baelish",2013-04-22,"assuming your friend has read the books i think a fair interpretation is that ramsay does what he does for his own very personal enjoyment and also as a stage in the process of reekifying theon even though it might seem to us viewers that theon has now lost his trust in boy i think he is very confused and that ramsay may well use this previously gained trust to mess with his head furtherhe hasnt read the books so he remains thoroughly confused i explained that it will make more sense down the road he was still confused about who burned winterfell and correctly guessed that it was the bastard of bolton but i wouldnt confirm it for the sake of spoiling events for him he started reading asos but i convinced him to start from the beginning as the changes in the show would only confuse him furtheroh and everyone loves daenerys now its hard not to tell them that her arc goes downhill from here edited by pinkie baelish 22 april 2013  0911 pm"

"Stannis' shadow babies",2013-04-27,"i think op may be right lf knows that ros is a spy and he may at least suspect tyrions lover is shae thats the reason ros speaks to her as girl like us lf may have already ordered ros to find out about shae"
"ShigellaSand",2013-04-28,"not if he suspected ros was the spy and provided her with a modified inventory list to see if anything came of iti think that in addition to identifying the spy littlefingers bigger endgame was in fact to engineer the lorassansa match and ultimately the sansatyrion match itself he wanted to contrive a set of circumstances where the next time he approached sansa to spirit her away sansa would be trapped in a horrible marriage and desperate for his help by leaking news of the lorassansa match to tywin he would also position himself as friendly helpful and not in any way personally interested in the girl himself heck he could even drop subtle hints that varys was the one who originally proposed the lorassansa match o olenna it would play out a little like this1 lf approaches sansa in 3x01 says he has an assignment and that he might be able to take sansa with him might suggests he can beg off if sansa actually expects him to follow through having no intention of doing so2 lf gives ros an inventory list with two featherbeds knowing full well that shes varys spy ros takes this information to varys who takes it to olenna unsurprisingly a lorassansa match is arranged3 sansa is thrilled with the lorassansa matchas littlefinger would expect4 lf just about to leave shows up supposedly to fetch sansa sansa refuses and explains the reason lf makes a great show of disappointment but is pleased at her refusal as he never intended to take her with him at this stage5 lf leaks this news to tywin tywin is impressed by littlefingers show of loyaltyusefulness6 tywin orders tyrion to marry sansa7 lf sails away having cleared himself of suspicion as a possible suitor for sansa since he all but arranged her marriage to another man and having gotten in good with tywin varys is pissedit would be pretty coolmy other thought that if he has identified ros as a spy he suspects that tyrion has a secret prostitute love but knows its not ros and further wants to ingratiate himself maybe hell tell tywin that tyrions lover is ros leading tywin to make good on his threatso in this scenario littlefinger would not only suspect that ros was a spy and that she was spying for varys hed also be able to predict that varys would go to olenna with this information not just do something to prevent lf getting his hands on sansa but do this particular thing rather than say arrange a little accident for sansa either killing her or just making her incapable of traveling get her out of there through his secret tunnels the way he does with tyrion later have her married off to somebody else etc etc thats a pretty damn good prediction since it seems the varysolenna alliance came from nowhereim skeptical im sure lf had backup plans to his backup plans to his backup plans but i dont think he reads minds"
"Shadow on the Wall",2013-04-28,"so in this scenario littlefinger would not only suspect that ros was a spy and that she was spying for varys hed also be able to predict that varys would go to olenna with this information not just do something to prevent lf getting his hands on sansa but do this particular thing rather than say arrange a little accident for sansa either killing her or just making her incapable of traveling get her out of there through his secret tunnels the way he does with tyrion later have her married off to somebody else etc etc thats a pretty damn good prediction since it seems the varysolenna alliance came from nowhereim skeptical im sure lf had backup plans to his backup plans to his backup plans but i dont think he reads mindsplans can grow organically so we can say that initially he wanted to investigate if ros was a spy and also supply varys with false information to see who he would go to with it at this point he would have probably expected varys to go to the tyrells due to varys becoming less and less close with the lannisters and tywin not being one for accusatory whispers so naturally lf would have kept spies on people like lady olennaas soon as one of his spies seeing varys talk to olenna littlefinger knows exactly what theyre going to plan to do and the plan mentioned by newstar can work perfectly if things had played out differently whilst it wouldnt give him an advantage it wouldnt disadvantage him and so his actions are easily justifiedthat said i dont think dd would have thought this carefully about littlefinger maybe they have and theyll prove me wrong but i imagine next episode littlefinger might just go to sansa and shell blab everything causing him to change his plans at the last minute and tell tywin but well see sooni just dont see varys sending sansa stark to escape through the tunnels far too much personal risk for himself without any real reward varys is far too selfish a player for that likewise he has no real reason to kill sansa stark its risky and unnecessary if he can just get her married off and form a strong alliance in the process i also dont think varys is naturally cruel so while it seems there were many options on the table for varys  one option in particular was clearly the best edited by steiner 28 april 2013  0522 am"

"Shadow on the Wall",2013-04-28,"no they have to keep with the same general plot arcs  and in that dorne and the iron islands are key players if they start deviating from the book massively come season 5 the show will spiral rapidly out of control instead what i suggest is that they vastly cut down on journey times because most of the journeys are boring so quentyn travelling to dany is virtually cut tyrions journeys shortened and made more interesting but with the same result briennes journey massively cut etc couple that with increasing character arc overlaps and the story will suddenly start to get more interesting but yes dd will have headaches galore come season 5  the number of character arcs ramps up so much it is almost unworkable on tv almost edited by steiner 28 april 2013  0507 am"

"ShigellaSand",2013-04-28,"i think it is clear the show will need to take a different approach than the books or it will lose its audience and succumb to some half hearted attempt to wrap things up once hbo pulls the plug after many viewers move on and i mean a drastic story changing deviation would you be ok with thisafter this episode the dany fanclub is at an all time high in membership she now has dragons a huge army and two loyal knights after only 25 booksseasons in a non readers eyes she is only missing ships and the producers should give her some in a completely different way than she attempts to acquire her own in the books i cant imagine the outrage that will come when by season 6 nothing has changed and she hasnt traversed over the sea or the fact that by the end of book 3 we have tyrion going to find her and by the end of book 5 he still hasntwe all know the first 3 books were the best i wouldnt be shocked at all if hbo completely tore through some of the story lines and went their own direction after this season there is no shame in not following the source material to the letter in my mind all movies and shows are their own adaptations and it is right about now that the show needs to make this decisioni think the introduction of dorne and the iron islands as major players would be a mistake i think introducing aegon would be a mistake wasnt his head dashed against a wall smilepng classbbcemoticon alt tv viewers cant handle more characters and plotlines and they certainly wont stand for story lines that literally do not develop after books and books seasons and seasons can we really watch ayra do her assassin training for two seasonsitll be a sad day if the show keeps following the books and then have it fizzle unceremoniouslyi definitely think that the show will deviate from the books and that some differences will be fairly important i dont see this as necessarily a bad thing since tv is a different medium than literature however i dont think its going to happen the way you suggesti believe the iron islands will be featured in season 4 not necessarily with all the characters  most likely victarion and the damphair would be merged into one for example  but balons death will be followed by a fight for the throne someone will be sent to find dany and there will be pillaging of the reach they already introduced theon and asha yara so there would be no sense in cutting out their future plotlines also they are an easy way to spice up the slower pace of affc  adwdlikewise i dont think dorne will be left out some of the sandsnakes disappearing would not surprise me  but theyre probably going to leave in one or two to up the number of proactive women and there must be some mention of what happened to myrcella since they based a lot of cerseis hatred for tyrion around that betrothal this may or may not happen in season 4 but oberyn will offer the first introduction to dorneaegon too soon to tell but yes im pretty sure there will be some changes andor additions to danys storyline in meereen they did it to qarth after all theyll pack some more action scenes in there im sure perhaps centered around the whole issue of feeding the dragons or maybe not since cgi is so expensive but i guess they could show the aftermath rather than the dragons themselvesthe traveling parts  brienne tyrion quentyn if hes even included  may well be shortened down or packed with more fighting or running into other characters no idea what theyll do with arya id say that depends on what grrm has told them about her future storylineall that said please be careful with phrases like we all know that x is y that way lies board fighting id suggest something more like i think a lot of people will agree that edited by shigellasand 28 april 2013  0620 am"
"Lady Sansa Stark",2013-04-28,"and what would we do when daenerys makes it to westeros far before she actually does in the books they cant do that i wouldnt mind if she wouldnt appear that much in the fifth season so that we have time to explore the dornish characters and oldtown for example then theres samwell tarly etc daenerys could show some meetings with her people and stuff something with the harpy etc but they cannot simple make up a whole new plotline which deviates too much from the books i mean her new plotline in season 2 when her dragons were gone and stuff worked rather well since it didnt change her overall story bringing her to westeros earlier would change her overall story and that of everyone else id rather have them focusing on other characters than just daenerys and her cool dragunz yes"

"jmk51",2013-04-28,"ive posted this before but we still dont know how important the iron islands and dorne are to the overall plot if the purpose of victaron sailing to dany is to shuttle her back that can be done many different ways so far dornes contribution has been a trial by combat and letting the other two dragons loose but we are about to lose several key characters over the next two seasons so there will be plenty of room to develop these new story lines at this point imo the book story is more a soap opera than anything else characters dying some reanimated random paths crossing new characters introduced but it doesnt seem the plot has moved forward greatly"
"Tyrion_the_Oneironaut",2013-04-28,"when you break it down theyre going to need a lot of filler scenes involving tyrion theon varys etc starting around episode 6 this season daenerys in mereen might also have a few surprises for book readers in season 4 and probably in season 5 the reasons arent really as you say to keep the tv audience happy but more so to keep the actors happy cant have an actor wait a year or two until theyre written back into a tv seriesie alphie allen"

"thenedstark",2013-04-28,"i think it may depend on when winds of winter comes out affc and adwd are both not very telegenic when it comes to battles and deaths both are more of epic fantasy soap operas which is great in its own way if hbo is content to put out a soap opera for a couple of seasons seasons 5 and 6 then that would work i guess however if wow comes out by then around 2016 and we have been promised some battles in the beginning of the book maybe those battles could help in retaining the viewership numbers for post season 56"

"Rhasgul",2013-04-22,"to start off id like to state that just like pretty much everyone else i loved the scene i had chills running down my spine when she started speaking high valyrian and i went crazy when the time for dracarys came i loved the way emilia acted and how her valyrian was close to perfection i want to state though that i really didnt like the fact that kraznys just stood there after receiving the dragon obviously its cool right you get one of the first dragons hatched in ages but he just stands there watching the dragon for such a long time dany has time for her whole zen moment and ordering the unsullied to march and such while he just stands there now dont get me wrong i know there are arguments like he just got a dragon hes shocked and he made a businessdeal so its normal to wait for a while or something the other part of me though feels like he knew that the dragon would be very wild and possibly angry for having to leave its mother i think the actual kraznys would first of all lock the dragon in a cage suppose he lost his grip and the dragon flew away and he would also leave the scene of trade pretty quickly its made clear how he has no respect whatsoever for dany so once the deal is done he wants nothing else from her i just dont think he would stand there still and silent waiting for something to happen its just something that bugged me while watching it and i was wondering if there was anyone else with the same feeling"
"Effie",2013-04-22,"i think it was a very arrogant move not to have a cage ready and i think he had the delusions of taming a dragon just like he tamed the unsullied and i think it was a very wondrous moment for him too sort of thinking ah itd be cool to have a dragon ill be almighty and then realizing oh wait i have a dragon an actual dragon hold on what now and of course halfway through danys big moment we can see how he is struggling because he cant control the dragon this is a bit silly but i felt like he expected a harry potter moment you know when potter first held the wand in the wand shop and lights started flickering and there was a wind machine involved and oh the magic i think kraznys expected something like that a magical moment that shows how powerful he is because it is a dragon after all so i felt he acted like a person who is stupid and powerhungry and arrogant and at the same time too stunned to realize what is going on around him and i think thats pretty much the character"
"Greywolf2375",2013-04-22,"i think it worked out pretty much as id expected  he completely disregards dany so in his opinion anything that she has under control obviously he would be able to control on top of that he holds the symbolic whip of the unsullied he receives the chain for the dragons so he should be the rightful master  thats how his thought process is working not that this is a potentially intelligent loyal creature to dany he sees it as property she sees it as a child"

"Iotun",2013-04-22,"eh i thought it was normal i thought from his perspective the way it should play out is i get the dragon she gets the whip i wait for a bit business like and keeping up the respectful pretences until she leaves or at least starts leaving while i hold the dragon then hand the chain to a slave or put the dragon in a cage and go from there if youre kraznys and youve just finished what is probably the biggest deal in your lifetime would you just go ok heres the whip bye now turn around and leave i think it was a business like i will stay here until the customer has left it didnt hurt that the entire city was watching him as well"

"darksellsword",2013-04-22,"i thought how he reacted was plausible he hadnt seen the dragons he negotiated for 1 dragon the biggest but maybe the reality of actually holding the chain of a dragon was over whelming he had no reason to believe dany had designs on killing him and the slave masters for him slavery is a necessary part of life he asks messandei to tell daenerys that her dragon will not come to him i think that he assumed that dany only had control over drogon because of the chain through training as for dany speaking valyrian and he ignores it well perhaps when she was commanding the army to move forward and halt he was thinking messandei had shown her the commands thats why i thought the look on messandeis face was priceless  she was the only one in the moment that realised the implications kraznys faith was sealed the moment he handed the whip to dany and explained its significance while she was commanding the unsullied to kill and the masters with whips soliders and to spare any child and to break the chains of any slave the sheer size of daenerys new army stunned any solider that would defend krazny they knew that the unsullied were hers now"

"greywindsrage",2013-04-25,"to start off id like to state that just like pretty much everyone else i loved the scenei had chills running down my spine when she started speaking high valyrian and i went crazy when the time for dracarys came i loved the way emilia acted and how her valyrian was close to perfectioni want to state though that i really didnt like the fact that kraznys just stood there after receiving the dragonobviously its cool right you get one of the first dragons hatched in ages but he just stands there watching the dragon for such a long time dany has time for her whole zen moment and ordering the unsullied to march and such while he just stands therenow dont get me wrong i know there are arguments like he just got a dragon hes shocked and he made a businessdeal so its normal to wait for a while or somethingthe other part of me though feels like he knew that the dragon would be very wild and possibly angry for having to leave its mother i think the actual kraznys would first of all lock the dragon in a cage suppose he lost his grip and the dragon flew away and he would also leave the scene of trade pretty quickly its made clear how he has no respect whatsoever for dany so once the deal is done he wants nothing else from her i just dont think he would stand there still and silent waiting for something to happenits just something that bugged me while watching it and i was wondering if there was anyone else with the same feelinghes a slave master who was so greedy to have a dragon that for anyone would be something priceless his lust for power and lack of respect for her blinded him from the fact that hes in over his head when he says the bitch has her army he doesnt even realise that hes fuckedbecause hes too concerned with this dragon he has never seen before in his life he sees power before him basically in his grasp and cant control it  his expressions in the scene clearly shows this especially when he takes the chain from her however when she says  a dragon is not a slave thats when he realises hes fucked edited by greywindsrage 25 april 2013  0125 am"
"Runaway Penguin",2013-04-25,"the scene was well written and exactly showed the slave masters complacency add to that the distressed cries of drogon when he was chained and given to a stranger very emotional scene kraznys was unable to go anywhere drogon wont come he was preoccupied by the struggling lizard and ignored the bitch from westeros until it was too late"
"lannistergold",2013-04-25,"the fact that the guy was prepared to sell his entire army says enough he was suicidally overconfident andor didnt think that dany had it in her to command an army his ignorance about dragon behaviour was the most excusable error of his"
"Runaway Penguin",2013-04-25,"he didnt care about dany being able to command or not he was just too wrapped up in his game to realise that someone might want to smash the board happens in real life as well wwii is good example stalin was so wrapped up in his plans he didnt realise that hitlers next target is ussr and ignored warnings allies initially uderestimated germany and germans for the most part underestimated the power of britain and usa  because in both cases part of the power came from smashing the board and playing a new game"
"Rhaenys Sand",2013-04-25,"i think it was a very arrogant move not to have a cage ready and i think he had the delusions of taming a dragon just like he tamed the unsullied and i think it was a very wondrous moment for him too sort of thinking ah itd be cool to have a dragon ill be almighty and then realizing oh wait i have a dragon an actual dragon hold on what nowand of course halfway through danys big moment we can see how he is struggling because he cant control the dragonthis is a bit silly but i felt like he expected a harry potter moment you know when potter first held the wand in the wand shop and lights started flickering and there was a wind machine involved and oh the magic i think kraznys expected something like that a magical moment that shows how powerful he is because it is a dragon after all so i felt he acted like a person who is stupid and powerhungry and arrogant and at the same time too stunned to realize what is going on around him and i think thats pretty much the character bowdowngif classbbcemoticon altbowdown "

"Elba the Intoner",2013-04-22,"why wouldnt they match up a gay man with a woman you do realize that all nobility needs to marry right furthermore it never has anything whatsoever to do with happy marriages its about alliances and power and in what way would anyone care if sansa isnt happy with her marriage after its done they want her claim to the north they arent trying to set up a match making service the tyrells arent a bunch of friendly angels they are as devious as everyone else and as soon as the marriage is done their plans would be completeand even if we go by the books sansa would rather be married to a gay loras than his cripple brother she wouldnt be happy either way but at least shed have her ideal image to show to others even if its a false oneyes exactly as you say the tyrells dont care about whether she will be happy but rather only about her claim to the north this is stressed in the varysolenna conversation when they say how should robb fail then she is the key to the north and as dontos told her in the books the tyrells are like the lannisters only with thorns but what i dont like about this change from the books is that sansa was willing to make the marriage work with willas who was a cripple despite not having met him and despite the fact that he was crippled she had determined in her mind to make him love her in time which is quite a mature thought process now she just comes off as not having matured or changed that much at all"

"All-for-Joffrey",2013-04-22,"i think people in this thread are making way too much hay about loras being gaywhat do they care if hes gay the bottom line is that all nobles particularly the great houses need all their children to marry to ensure their line and strengthen their position in this case getting the best available claim to winterfell and the north loras sexual orientation is simply not a factor in the equation even if he is a third son if they had thought this was an issue why did they let their daughter margery marry renly in the first place oh right for political reasonsfor those that think loras would be unable to produce heirs with sansa or would be as obtuse as renly was about making babies with margery im sure the queen of thrones would insist on standing over the bed with a stick beating loras until he inseminated her or something you know hbo would go thereanyway back from the realm of the creepy in order to mirror sansas shock and disappointment to learn that shes marrying a cripple willas like in the books maybe a subplot over the next episode or two could involve her learning that loras is gay which would obviously make her about as dismayed as learning that her future husband is a cripplealso to whatever poster mentioned loras future wife potentially mocking him for being gay and effeminate  what exactly about loras strikes you as effeminate or are you just displaying cultural stereotypes and equating homosexuality with effeminacy edited by allforjoffrey 22 april 2013  1040 am"

"Darth Pipes",2013-04-22,"truth be told a loras not in the kingsguard makes the most sense to marry sansa willas is the heir of highgarden while marrying the oldest daughter and suspected heir of house stark is a logical marriage hes not going up to the north garlan is married and about to take over brightwater keep hes not going up north loras is a knight of some fame but hes got no lands he could go up to winterfell and rule in sansas name although i cant see the greatjohn kneeling to a guy called the knight of flowers"
"stiff_pirates",2013-04-22,"i think were missing the intentions of the tyrells and lannisters regarding power both know that sansa is the key to the north as varys mentions in this episode so having her at highgarden would be preferable to the tyrells loras is not yet a member of the kingsguard in the books he is only just recently a sworn knight of the kingsguard before jamie returns this means there is an opening for him to marry sansa weve seen previously that margaery and mace tyrell had direct plans for margaery as queen whoever her partner king may have been having the same intentions for powerful positions through loras seems to be legitimate also sansa would never dismiss an offer like that unfortunately tywin catches wind of the scheme and counters the proposition with the immediate marriage to tyrion the scene between tyrion and tywin in episode 2 hinted at a use for tyrion which book readers know the outcome is their marriage tywin basically then reserves the starknorth legacy for the lannisters he does this by having cersei request him to join the kg to which loras cannot decline essentially it does give loras a fly on the wall position for small council meetings and royal secrets etc which is why he takes the position too loras is the vessel for sansas title to the tyrells edited by stiffpirates 22 april 2013  0849 pm"

"AliKat",2013-04-24,"im still waiting for a scene where sansa expresses grief for her brothers or when someone in kings landing talks about what happened maybe itll come after the red wedding it has to come after the red wedding or tywin will bring it up next episode after all from what ive seen from the preview theyll tell tyrion to marry sansa what good would that be if bran and rickon were still alivethere is a scene from alot of the promos that has tyrion tywin and maybe others in a room with joffrey and he yells i am the king everyone is mine to torment which makes me think that hes talking about sansa and tormenting her about the rw andor her little brothersone thing that grrm really glazed over and it bothers me was showing the reactions of the stark kids to the deaths and the rw he writes about stannis mentioning to jon about the rw but never show his reaction to the deaths of all of his brothers bran saw through summer about grey windrobb but does he know about his mother does he know about lady stoneheart are his visions limited to the stark kids that still have their wolves jon robb rickon but if so  how did he knows about his father the show seemed to be setting up rickon with some type of sixth sense in season 1 when he told bran that no one was coming back when robb left then he knew about ned but then they kind of dropped that storyline and so far in season 3  he hasnt spoken lol we saw him once but he didnt speakanyway  i love the show i love the books but i think reading the books sets up too many expectations for the show its an incredible show and stands well on its own but if you compare the two it does get frustrating which makes me wish i had read the books after each season"

"Woman of War",2013-04-27,"i am still only on the beginning of those but i am just stating my opinion on why i am slightly more comfortable with willas rather then tyrioni am thoroughly uncomfortable with both of them in that situation since i am aware that forced or arranged marriages are still very much reality in our world not only violating the young women but the young men as well first of all gay men and my admittedly pointed opinion is that defending arranged marriages as opposed to forced marriages means agreeing that the parents choose the rapist of their daughter thus drawing the carpet of parental solidarity from under her feet by making common cause with her abusewe with our western values live on a peaceful island of the blessed compared to many parts of the world and the fate of women therebut that has not so much to do with the book or series situation of sansa loras and tyrion"
"SilentSense",2013-04-27,"yep no mention of any other brother in the show so loras is it loras is not a member of the kg yet my guess tywin will make him one in order to scuttle the marriage yeah quite ironic given that this is how he was deprived of his desired heir to casterly rock well done by the show writers"
"Sun",2013-04-27,"but willas is sansas fantasy in a mental construct she forms to protect herself from harsh reality this man does not exist she has projected all her hopes there and has given consent to a fiction apart from that in our world even if a child agrees to sexual abuse it is still just as much abusesansas hopes have nothing to do with the person willas nothing to do with sexual desire how could they they are a straw for survival the reality would be someone who fucks her for her claim she would find that out only a little later and the fall would be just as deep or deeper since she would get fuckedagreed"
"jons nissa",2013-04-27,"very much agree really struggling to see how the issue of consent is being missed here in the case of tyrion shed already been threatened by cersei threatened by joffrey groped by joffrey and got the line about smashing her portcullis from tyrion that day while being taken to the sept under armed guard seems like anything that vaguely looks like consent is lacking heresansa was talked to and her consent was gained when it came to willas how is this even cause for confusionpossibly because even with consent the situation for sansa is horrible she gives consent to puppies and picnics again not understanding what she is really doing however she does understand she has a claim that everyone is aftershe gave consent to joffrey as well and look how that turned out did her consent mean all is ok and fair now woman of war is correct in that consent seems to be a bit overblown here since arranged or forced marriage can still be a nightmare tyrion is a member of the family that has caused her family harm and destruction however he is the only one who shows her the decency to give her time to come to understand what marriage really is people say he shouldnt be considered a hero because he stopped but that was the point of the whole scene that he was willing to do what society expected him to  even what sansa expected him to  but he didnt because he realized that sansa was still thinking of songs and fairytales he told her hed wait for her to come to him it may never happen but i do not see willas saying that not with the threat of the lannisters being so evident i also dont see the queen of thorns allowing such folly the tyrells were more united and knew what needed to be done to get the results they wanted tyrions discord with his family was a blessing for sansas situation here his stopping definitely put his familys plans for sansa in jeopardywillas was a dream and safety from kings landing for sansa just as loras is neither one will marry her so the switch is not extremely important the only thing lost is that sansa shows she sees beyond beauty at this point which may possibly be shown on the show in another way"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-04-27,"doesnt all this just boil down to a generalized opposition to arranged marriages in westeros did joffrey really have much more of a choice than did sansa ned though an adult was equally bound by custom to marry a woman he didnt really even know or want and the same for catelyn i dont get why this is such a big deal in the context of the books or why it is any worse than lots of the other barbarismlack of respect for individual rights in westerosmedieval setting arranged marriages  big deal"
"jons nissa",2013-04-27,"i agree men were just as forced as women when it comes to arranged marriages however the argument is always made that men had it easier and they did they had easier access to lovers and could hide bastards easier than a woman the argument is also made that tyrion had more choice than sansa as to whether or not to marry ive seen really solid defense of both sides of this argument so i think its hard to take a definite stand on this that said i believe tyrion was as forced to do this as sansa but i agree there were real rewards for tyrion as a result of the union while sansa gained nothing bringing this to the willasloras proposal again there are real gains for the groom but sansa only gains a chance to leave kings landing not that thats a small matter but very unfair all things considered so its really not much better for her eta my last post was really addressing the issue of consent and its importance and its shortcomings edited by jons nissa 27 april 2013  1016 am"
"Rhaegarsjoy",2013-04-27,"i think their parents can force them the first time around and since there is no such thing as deforce some found other ways to get their revenge or any sort of happiness and not always the right way like cercei refused to have her husbands children lysa kills her to be with the man she loved sansa maybe as she got older could have found a way to get rid of unwanted husband wether tyrion or willas"
"Ser Pounce FTW",2013-04-27,"the reality would be someone who fucks her for her claim she would find that out only a little later and the fall would be just as deep or deeper since she would get fuckedi agree he and the rest of the tyrells only wanted her for her claim but i think she is aware of that what she isnt aware of yet and how could she be is what it really means to be married jons nissa is correct its puppies and picnics shes thinking of not consummation with a complete stranger pregnancy and possibly dying in childbirth finding commonality with that stranger or how life at highgarden although probably safer than kings landing might not be the song she would like it to be lets face it she thinks the tyrells are her friends until she is literally walking toward tyrion to be married she is just not aware of what lies ahead for her regardless of who she marries"
"Tommen",2013-04-28,"the one thing i didnt necessarily like about all that is the fact that margaery is supposed to feel safe by joffs side cause her bro is a kg which i guess also doesnt matter in the show cause shes the puppeteeri think thats one of best changes theyve made on the show margaery protecting herself with her own wits rather than relying on a man to reassure her smilepng classbbcemoticon alt and i think tbh that margaery thinks shes doing both sansa and loras a personal favour loras son would be lord of winterfell and i dont think shes heartless enough to realise that sansa desperate to escape joffrey and cersei even marrying a man who isnt sexually interested in her is surely preferable to being joffreys prisoner"
"Hound's She-wolf",2013-04-29,"why do people dislike sansa for fantasizing and dreaming shes a 12 year old girl stuck in hell she has been beaten and stripped in front of the court and is still held hostage by the same people that killed her family ofcourse shes going to daydream and try to fantasize about a husband that loves her and what a wonderful life shes going to have when she gets away from kings landing in the book she knows nothing negative about willas other than hes crippled and that doesnt bother her i always think of loras as the westeros version of justin bieber or more like lance bass ofcourse shes going to jump at the chance to get out of kings landing with him i dont think she has a concept of what really goes on in the marriage bed either her parents did a terrible job preparing any of their kids for life in kings landing or for playing the game of thrones"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-04-29,"why do people dislike sansa for fantasizing and dreamingsansas character arc has been more than that and you cant just look at the fantasizing without what came before when considering peoples reactions to her to many people she was easy to dislike in agot given her treatment towards her sister particularly the component where she made fun of her because of her looks or because she wasnt ladylike enough etc then lying about mycah ratting our her fathers plans to cersei etc all of those actions became part of how people perceived her the stuckup conceited girl who thinks the only things that matter are how pretty you are and which boys like you and whose interest in the world is pretty much limited to how things will work out for her personally for many people i think that doesnt paint a very attractive picturebecause of how things went in kl she really hasnt had much of a chance yet to demonstrate that shes matured her preoccupation with dreaming and fantasizing suggests that she still thinks that its all about her and so just fantasizes about how her life could be so much better theres nothing wrong with doing that on occasion but that seems to be much more the case with sansa than with her younger siblings bran and arya who are acting and not just dreaming that doesnt make her a bad person but i think it makes her less appealing as a character especially in comparison with the level of activity in which everyone else seems engaged again her being stuck in kl really limits what she can do so people are left with the somewhat negative impression of her from agotleaving aside nasty agot sansa i think the biggest problem she has in terms of perceptions is that people generally dont like watchin people who seem like they feel sorry for themselves all the time its just not a very attractive or interesting quality edited by former lord of winterfell 29 april 2013  1248 pm"

"mafalda",2013-04-22,"okay here goesnow usually i like varys scenes infact hes one of my favorite characters in either the book or show i also think conleith hill is incredibly talented his scene with the qot was brilliantbutdidnt his speech about being cut seem a little forced i dont know what i was expecting from the scene but something about the way he delivered it just didnt sit well with meyes it was way rushed and way too casual it really bugged methank you i am so glad to see this mentioned this line that brienne said to jaime i love the briennejaime story this season and the actors are perfect but the brienne who had that very nice moment with cat last season where she tells her that she has a womans courage would not say something like thisalso now ros varys and olenna know that lf is interested in sansa and was going to try and take her to the eyrie so how are they going to handle the search for her after the purple wedding when sansa completely disappears i dont buy that absolutely no one including varys and olenna is going to wonder if lf took her and got her to the eyrie somehow especially after word starts to get out that lfs long lost daughter that nobody ever knew he has shows up with him thereotherwise it was a great episode and i really enjoyed itim so curious to know how they will handle this naturally dd will just make something upo yeahwhen the seven hells are the dragons going to get namedi have no idea but i completely forgot about the other two because they only ever show drogon why is cgi so expensive really anyone who knows please tell mei did get bored with olenna in the middle of her third sentence ninjagif classbbcemoticon altninja always chamberpots and roses dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno imagine youd work for her and had to listen to that every day again and again the scene inadvertedly got to be not about her sharp tongue and mind but about a puffish tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp lol your post made me laugh the only funny thing she said was what happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit the rest of it i was kind of wishing for the main point of the conversation to be made if i had to work for her id leave highgarden entirelyno one will probably agree with me but i cant stand lena headeys portrayal of cersei at all it was a little bit better this episode probably because i think the dialogue between her and tywin in their madeup scene was pretty spoton but i just dont feel like the actress understands her at all i also dont think shes that great of an actress yeah she is better than clarke harington turner madden but shes overrated imo i know im in the huge minority since i dont even know anyone who feels this way but for whatever reason her portrayal irks me they missed a huge opportunity by not giving mormont his last words the writers grab onto every chance they can to have cheesy writing so why they would decide not to let a man give his touching last words before he dies is beyond weird it was a great opportunity because how else now are viewers going to be reminded that jeor is jorahs father i know plenty of people who forgotdont know that connection and they could have placed it perfectly right here if timed right they could just cut to jorahs face at the end of the scene to emphasize it from jeor to jorah what a missed opportunity shamei agree with everyone about varys story coming out of nowhere actually it stuck out like a sore thumb it was like yo sup tyrion let me tell you this story how i was cut  awkward writing but conleth hill handled it well as usuali like diana rigg and looooveee qot but i dont know im starting to find her irritating she talks so much about farting and chamberpots and shes nothing like i really pictured personalitywise i feel they dumbed her down because of the dowager countessfour whores thinking a virgin is so great that they get together and decide not to pay him is ludicrousits ludicrous with one whore  but four come onlittlefinger was too distracted to care about the whores not getting paid yet scared the shit out of ros last season for being a buzzkill for the customers sure okaywhat a tropeits annoying how much dd love ros like shes the daryl dixon of asoiaf or something her whole moving up in the world scene with shae was idiotic and now she can read is an executive assistant to a pimp and escorts him around townwtf how did this even happenbran scenes are just pointless and im sick of seeing dead or soon to be dead starks in his dreams i agree with you about lena her portrayal is umm well i think shes almost quite there but theres something missing about her i cant quite pinpoint it it was throughout s1 and most of s2 im only thinking shes improving because shes nailing cerseis right amount of paranoia my friend who has also read the books thinks shes pretty but not pretty enough to play cersei and that the queen of westeros is supposed to be one of the most beautiful women as she was described in the bookswhen i first saw the mutiny at ck i didnt have much thought on it because i was so caught up in the moment but it was very messily done i watch the show with my bf who isnt a bookie and he thought the entire nw just turned evil and crazy and i had to explain that only a few of them turned crazy and they just stabbed mormont and left him there no sam talking to him no last words nothing the non bookies dont even know that jeor is jorahs dad but i guess dd doesnt care and no raven my old bear deserved better sadpng classbbcemoticon alt dany oh dany amazing scene my favorite scene from the whole series but why hasnt she changed her clothes it didnt bug me last eppy when she wore the same outfit for a second eppy in a row but it bugged me

"Pinkie Baelish",2013-04-22,"just like stephen dillanes portrayal of stannis i think lenas portrayal of cersei is the right way to go if she acted just like cersei does in the books she would just seem ridiculous like an evil queen out of a childrens movie rather than having cersei being fiery and so blatantly awful i feel its more realistic if her demeanour is just icecold and bitter rather than mwuhahahaha look how evil i am it works for joffrey because hes a little brat but it just wouldnt translate as well on the screen for cersei a more developed and wellrounded character in the same way if dillane was as grouchy as book stannis and just kept hissing and snapping and glaring every single moment it would look silly i really dig the gritty attitude he displays while playing stannis"

"Mediumjon Umber",2013-04-22,"one thing i dislike is how defensive he got when framing theon though ive brought him back he he killed the others doesnt sound very ramsayesque bookramsay when he drops the mask which tvwise was right now is commanding and sure of himself to the point of shameless arrogancewell i imagine roose wouldnt be very pleased if he learned that ramsay killed his men just to amuse himself i think ramsays in charge of the dreadfort but he still fears his father"
"Delmas",2013-04-22,"well i imagine roose wouldnt be very pleased if he learned that ramsay killed his men just to amuse himself i think ramsays in charge of the dreadfort but he still fears his fathernot to mention the men are likely to revolt if they know their leader killed many of their brothersfriends for a few laughsalso he may not want theon to know he is actually the one in charge"
"freetickles",2013-04-22,"yeah i dont think hes acting subservient just trying to hide the fact he killed his fathers men also i think hes avoiding showing authority so he can keep up a bit of his ruse with theon  who may even still trust him despite being betrayed since he has no other options"
"Frey Pie a la Mode",2013-04-22,"yes its still all a part of the game that ramsey is playing with theon and the writers are playing with the nonbook readers"

"Neeps on a Breastplate",2013-04-22,"i wouldnt be surprised if boy goes back to playing innocent once the other men leave the room claiming that something must have happened to yara and that he had to act like he recaptured theon on purposenot because its believable mind you but because he wants to see how many times he can jerk theon around before the big reveal theon is obviously desperate for a friend and confidante  its his big character flaw  and ramsey is just the sort of person to mine the depths of that sort of weakness like its treasure"
"Grandpa House",2013-04-23,"as far as the he killed the others line goes i actually think the true reveal came to fruition right after that line when he actually steps in front of the torture rack and says put him back where he belongs this was probably so the viewer and theon could have time to fully grasp the 2part twist 1 that the servant boy had betrayed theon and 2 that he was actually the leader"

"Pinkie Baelish",2013-04-23,"like the op i completely distance the show from the books it should be judged on the merits of a tv show first and foremost and not on how well it adapts the source material i dont deduct marks for changes from the books i dont deduct marks if a character does something which goes against their character in the books as its become really obvious that the characters on the books and show are different as long as its within their show character to do so im fine with it which is why i wasnt so upset with cats monologue about jon for the most part it was in character with tv catelyn i also look at the entertainment factor and how well it tells a story the plot should not move a mile a minute and i think many people here get upset when the show does oneoff scenes that dont advance the plot personally i think such scenes are necessary give the audience a few minutes to cool down before launching into the next plot development scene like any other show i tend to stay away from giving 10s unless it truly is something special baelor blackwater"

"Dove",2013-04-23,"the only time ill subtract anything for a deviation from the book is when i feel as though its a change that actually hurts the narrative of the tv show otherwise i see them as two seperate beasts that enhance my enjoyment of each other and grade the episodes depending on their quality as a standalone thing in addition to an adaptation its much more enjoyable and much less stressful than getting mad at every little change or whatever"
"Ser Creighton",2013-04-23,"i do it episode by episode and its pretty simple how much did i enjoy this week i actually try not to compare it directly to other shows and honestly what show out there can you compare it to like i love archer but their is nothing to compare walking dead justified you cant really compare them just like i would not compare a monet to a picasso you dont compare seurat to rousseau i look for different things from different shows because each show is different and deserves to rated on its own merits and what it is trying ot achive granted its tv and not painting but you should get the general idea i do incorperate some of the books into judging the show i have read the books it cant really be helped if their is something from the books i am hoping to see and then it is not put in the series of course i am going to be disappointed also its hbo i pay extra from hbo and i expect the best from hbo mostly because of their excellent track record so its going to be a higher standard i judge the shows with thrones has been one of the best shows on tv but that does not mean every episode is great they have had some lemons and some gems certain moments can be brutal shea and tyrion it doesnt work and the added scenes are brutal i will hammer the show when something meaning full is cut from the books in favor a meangless shea and tyrion scene that whole sitcom dialogue scene where shea talks about sansa and tyrion is one of if not thee most brutal scenes in the shows history ruined the episode for me the whole thing was so out of place and i felt like i was watching a game of friends they also seem to have gutted the jon snow and the knights watch arc like i never felt like they made a long march to crasters or that they were starving or that anyting was getting tense it felt like they marched for a day and were there for a day or two at most no desperation in those scenes at all however as a whole that episode had so many good moments that even one or two not so good moments it still end up as an excellent watch its odd the show always seems to be either kind of a buildup episode or an epic episode that has like one or two bad scenes and like 10 great moments i have all but given up on jon and the nights watch ever being anything good and its a shame as it takes away from the story"
"Shitmouth the Wise",2013-04-23,"gut feeling 10 being perfect 9 being excellent 8 being really good 7 being pretty good i dont think ive ever given an episode less than 7 since the sheer talent of the actors and production value overall is just so good tied in with the overall excellent source material i dont ever find an episode not to be rated at least pretty good by methis isnt really compared to other tv shows books movies or anything like that its just a feeling of entertainment i get from watching itthis is how i do it never given out a 10 though and i think a 7 only once"

"freetickles",2013-04-22,"it will still be barristan what makes you think he obviously doesnt know anything about jorahs past arrangement i think the only problem is its the reveal of arstanasbarristan that prompts barristan to throw jorah under the bus theyll have to come up with another way to make barristan decide to reveal that but it wont be tough theyve already laid the groundwork for barristan being willing to tell dany about the past when asked"

"WhiteGuts",2013-04-22,"ive noticed that people were upset with the lfsansa scene from valar dohaeris as it gives away a big twist after the purple wedding however varys scenes in this episode have confirmed my suspicions of what i think will happenthis is where i think the show is going with the lf subplotgiven that there is a rivalry between baelish and varys on the show it makes sense that varys would foil lfs plot to take sansa with himim assuming that the show wants the viewer to believe that littlefinger was planning to take sansa with him this season when he departs from the vale this is different from the book where he always intended to take her back after the purple weddingnow in the next few episodes lf will be made aware of the fact that varys found out about his plan and like in the books will reveal the tyrells intentions to marry sansa off to loras however he has an added motive in the show which is his rivalry with varysthe viewer will be lead to believe that there is no need for sansa to leave with baelish as she can now marry loras however loras being appointed into the kingsguard and sansas forced marriage to tyrion will dash the viewers hopes of her escaping klin season 4 until the pw the viewers will still believe that sansa has no other option but to stay married to tyrion if the showrunners play their cards right littlefinger will be ignored for the first few episodes thus reducing the viewers beliefs that he will help sansa escapethat way after the pw when sansa escapes to a boat with littlefinger on it the show will still contain an element of suprise rather than blatantly telegraphing whos behind her escapelf then kills ros who helps sansa escape revealing that he had found out about her spying on himby doing this the show will stay true to the character of lf showing his ability to adapt and turning anything into an advantage as well as playing up on the whole lfvarys rivalrythoughtsedit this is pretty much a repost of my other thread as i didnt think this would be approved so feel free to lock this one if you want modsit would be really great if it plays out this way and i think it will very nice catch"
"victim",2013-04-22,"im just glad ros finally has a role other than the tits i dont think shell be the dontos its pretty clear she mislikes littlefinger quite a lot and probably wouldnt deliver sansa too him"
"The Unborn",2013-04-22,"well me i like to think that the other place littlefinger reserved on the boat is not for sansa maybe he will take ros with him and kill her because he knows she spies on him for varys or something else"
"KoishNoish",2013-04-22,"should the plot play out like this i think it will work will with one exception right now we know that varys ros and olenna all know of littlefingers interest with sansa so if she should disappear off the face of the earth and littlefinger should suddenly get a daughter then surely varys and olenna will notice i suppose if sansa is disguised as a maid it would work but id prefer it to stay loyal to the books in this respect surely the writers can see the flaw here cant they how are they going to patch it up"
"Mediumjon Umber",2013-04-22,"i think i read somewhere that dd arent quite finished with dontos yet i could be absolutely wrong though but i cant provide any links so this is a shot in the dark anyway i think dontos might have a bigger role in s4 up until the pw as there wont be much going on in kl in s4 so dragging out the wedding and sansas escape might be a good idea as for ros substituting that lady friend cersei had in affc with ros would be an abomination but i dont see it as totally impossible seeing as how ros is moving up in the world and cersei slowly begins her degeneration into a paranoid drunk"
"Kasrith",2013-04-22,"i like this and have been thinking along the same lines the preview of the next ep also fortifies this for me as we see sansa watching a ship sailing off most likely lfhttpwwwyoutubechvsoemaxlkgrq"
"Iotun",2013-04-22,"not totally related but i think this is more evidence that seals the pw being in season 3 so far we have two big plot points mentioned in pretty much every episode  joffreys marriage  and the rivalry regarding what will happen to sansa and whether she will be won by the tyrells lannisters or littlefinger both of these plots end at the pw and it seems clumsy to introduce them now and give them so much significance but not end them if the pw was in season 4 i think the show would not have shown littlefinger being behind a third attempt to control sansa and kept that as a season 4 surprise so that her arc in season 3 involves only the lannistertyrrel proposals and ends with her marrying tyrion the fact that littlefinger has already been introduced as part of that plot indicates that the plot has to end with his own involvement edited by iotun 22 april 2013  0256 pm"
"Mulled Wino",2013-04-22,"its never actually confirmed in the books whether varys is aware of lfs involvement in the purple wedding i dont think its out of the question considering that it only benefits varys purposesnot necessarily varys has much more control of sansa when he can keep an eye on her as long as in your scenario theres an explanation of why she didnt sell out sansa the second time i wont go beserk nothing is confirmed in the book a lot is left unsaid but i think its widely considered that lf pulled the coup off masterfully varys at least feigns ignorance"

"PatchfaceTheFool",2013-04-22,"since grrm consults on the shows i guess we can assume that anything added to the show that are not in the books will not contradict the overall plot of the series for example for those who were skeptical of whether varys really was a eunuch we know that yes he really is from the episode where ros tried to grab his junk and realized there was nothing thereso varys scene with tyrion in this episode was really interesting to me because it tells a couple of things we see varys having the sorcerer who cut him captured and delivered to him im pretty sure that sorcerer will never be seen or heard of againso now we know avarys really was cut against his will bthe sorcerer wasnt marwyn as some theories suspected or anyone else that we are gonna meet later in the books basically hes not important to the plotin the books from the conversation arya overhears between varys and illyrio we get the impression that varys little birds have their tongues cut so varys hates the sorcerer for mutilating him and throwing him out to die and yet he is involved in the mutilation and slavery of hundreds of children himself this tells us that varys isnt operating out of some sense of altruistic justicei was also assuming that what the voice in the fire said during the ritual was somehow going to be important to discovering varys true goals see here for theories  though after this scene im not so sure"
"Pinkie Baelish",2013-04-22,"mods please be extra kind and approve this thread from what ive seen so far this season ep4 pretty much confirmed my suspicions on how theyll be handling sansas escape from lf while still progressing with the whole varys vs littlefinger rivalry theyre doing from what weve seen in episode 1 im assuming the show wants the viewer to believe that littlefinger intends to take sansa with him this season when he departs for the vale and varys putting an axe in his plans furthers the rivalry the two have since varys suggested marrying sansa to loras it makes sense within show canon to have lf reveal this plot to the lannisters because not only does it fit into his agenda but it further plays up his rivalry with varys lf then departs for the vale after telling tywin of the plot i believe the show runners want the viewers hopes of sansa leaving kl to be dashed after her wedding to tyrion even more so after the red wedding since she will have no close family to return to if the show goes with this and sweeps littlefinger under the rug up until the aftermath of the purple wedding the show will still be able to contain the element of surprise when its revealed that littlefinger orchestrated sansas escape plus changing the story a bit so that lf orchestrates the pw only after varys messes up his plans stays true to the character as it shows his ability to adapt and turn any disadvantage into an advantage if ros takes up the part of dontos and is killed by baelish after helping sansa escape this also wraps up the rivalry between baelish and varys thoughts"
"Pellaeon",2013-04-22,"i think the viewers have already seen the creepy situation andd that lf lusts for sansa the lines of varys and ros only confirmed that so i am sure the show runners want to build the escape up more like something to dread instead of hopeanother stroke of fate against sansa they have shown that littlefinger isnt her knight more like a second captori am also not sure if loras is really varyss and olennas plan is loras really the plani think the show goes in a very different direction"
"Lord Varys",2013-04-22,"my guess is that sansa will tell littlefinger next week  perhaps due to shaes advice  when finally departs for the vale that he can go fuck himself with his vague promises she doesnt need him anymore because she now has loras loras in a way that would mirror how the tyrell plot was undone in the book as well sansa told dontos about willas dontos told littlefinger and littlefinger told tywin the real interesting thing will be how littlefinger is going to end up being involved in the tyrell plot to poison joffrey they should better not change that"

"Nobody of the canals",2013-04-20,"on what happens to loras after the lorassansa engagement presumably falls through spoilers for tv show spoiler in the big entertainment weekly feature the journalist described the filming of sansas wedding there was an exchange between cersei and margaery the journalist mentioned margaery said to cersei something along the lines of well be sisters soon and cersei shoots back call me your sister again and ill strangle you in your sleepmother and daughter for sure since cersei will become margaerys motherinlaw but sisters the only way the sisters line makes senseassuming the journalist heard properly and isnt making stuff upis if loras and cersei are indeed betrothed however briefly since that would make cersei and margeaery sistersinlawtheres a shot in a few of the featurettes of loras storming away from a dinner with the qot margaery and some others and then glaring down balefully at everyone i thought it was from sansa and tyrions wedding but it could also be the following after the qot has told loras hes to marry sansa or after hes been informed hes to marry cersei instead im pretty sure either option would piss him off although cersei probably more so loli kind of like the idea of a lorascersei engagement there would be some epic bitchface going on i think are they going to have cersei and margery at loggerheads so openly so soon edited by nobody of the canals 20 april 2013  0230 pm"
"King Tommen",2013-04-20,"sizeare they going to have cersei and margery at loggerheads so openly so soonthey were sniping at each other politely in the first episode this season makes sense given that the show has given margaery more screentime at this point than the books did and theyve made her political maneuvering more overt i like them emphasizing the tyrelllannister rift right from the start so we get more context when joffreys death occurs as to why the tyrells are so dangerous it also makes cersei look smarter because shes the first one to sniff out that this isnt going to end well while joffrey has no clue and even tywin doesnt really understand the extent to which theyre a threat it will make cerseis paranoia with tommen and margaery even more logical in future seasons as well"
