"Loras",2011-04-26,"710 dropped marks for the dany scenes which i felt were poorly developed from episode 1 i thought there could have been greater focus on the lannister twins after the close of episode 1 i found the introduction of secondary characters a bit lame payne the hound doreah  other than that a nice episode it felt very much like the second hour of a 2 hour premiere now the story really starts smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "
"Holymoly",2011-04-26,"far better than the first episode although i suppose they had to rush through that one in order to arrive at the bran incident for the cliffhanger i still feel the flow of the story would be enhanced by scheduling it as 5 x 2 hour episodes rather than 10 x 1 hour shows but overall the adaptation has improved with the second program tyrion rapidly assuming the mantle of star of the show that he has in the books and cersei really well observed by lena headley"
"BlackStoneCA",2011-04-26,"i gave it a 9 out of 10 mainly as there was no real slow bits it kept my attention and the fact that i blinked at one point and nearly the full hour had passed that is good television if makes you go oh my god where did the time go"
"Greywolf2375",2011-04-26,"between 78 of 10 none of the changes break anything for me  just have me scratching my head wondering why jaimejon interaction the transition for dany works but is a little fast i happen to think the cat comment to jon should have been included positiveslots the action of the direwolves joffrey getting beaten the number of line for line scenes from the book the nonchalance of the hound with micahs body bran waking up when lady dies biggest gripe is that it wasnt a full hour"
"ingsve",2011-04-26,"these are astonishingly high ratings for being an internet poll theres usually somone who gives the 1 vote in protest or whatever but here theres not a single vote of 5 or lower"
"Kalbear",2011-04-26,"yeah its almost as if the poll is being hosted on a fansite for the series the show is based on crazy i gave it a 9 arya made the show for me and tyrion followed that up those are my two favs in the book and they really make it shine here"
"tuthmoses",2011-04-26,"gave 8 out of 10 for the first episode and 9 out of 10 for the second and was verging on giving 1010 thought it was excellent and much better than the first tyrion is really starting to come into his own i really like the actors playing jon and arya the girl playing sansa is better than i thought from the first episode very few negatives maybe a few more shots of ghost and greywind id have had ghost running alongside jons horse as he left winterfell  but eh thats only very minor the scene where the assasin fought with cat and summer came to the rescue was cool still not sure about theon though  edited by tuthmoses 26 april 2011  0434 pm"
"Nebiros",2011-04-26,"there seems to be a consensus here i also gave 8 for the first one and 9 for this one the first one got the environments the people and the little details right the second one did the same but it also had interesting stories to tell sure theyre mostly all from the book but i think this episode showed that the producers did the transition from book to the screen exceptionally well it almost seems as if asoiaf had always been intended as a tv script the deviations from the original text were all well done the multiple povs worked the storylines worked the chemistry between the actors worked  even the direwolf action worked and i was very sceptical of that so altogether a very polished episode that can stand proudly on its own although its certainly a transition episode with so much travelling in it i can only imagine how great this show will be when they get to the really meaty stuff if they dont screw up big time when it really matters i really cant see this show going wrong at this point"
"flyingwind66",2011-04-26,"yeah its almost as if the poll is being hosted on a fansite for the series the show is based on crazyi gave it a 9 arya made the show for me and tyrion followed that up those are my two favs in the book and they really make it shine here710 for me dany scenes were a bit weak should have mentioned the whole riding thing and how if shes on top then shes riding him anyways onwards totyrion arya and sansa  theyre my favorite tyrion showed a lot of his personality here maisie williams is superb also sansa really gave me that same vibe i got from her in the 1st book as an older sister myself i though that sansa was a real cunt for not standing up for her sister and for lyingthe 2nd half of the episode really did it for me except i dont think that huge search party was really neccessary to find 1 little girl  i mean it took them until after sundown to find her"
"RedWeddingCake",2011-04-26,"the 2nd half of the episode really did it for me except i dont think that huge search party was really neccessary to find 1 little girl  i mean it took them until after sundown to find herthey were trying to find aryadid you read the books smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "
"The Anti-Targ",2011-04-26,"i was mostly happy with the progression from ep1 but like others have said i thought the dany scenes didnt quite work they are doing a great job of making tyrion a sympathetic character and thus creating some of the complexity of each house having its good eggs and bad eggs marked it down one from ep1 so its 8 and 7 so far from me"
"Renasko",2011-04-26,"i like the dany chapters in the books but every damn scene of hers makes me cringe at the moment hell even before her scene comes on screen im internally thinking about the current scene elapsing and hoping one of hers doesnt follow makes me uncomfortable the sooner her plot advances the better i gave it an 810"
"Kaitscralt",2011-04-26,"i gave it an eight out of ten i am doing a reread and had literally just finished those chapters that day so the verbatim dialogue  while awesome  made it seem like i had just watched it"
"Fippy Darkpaw",2011-04-26,"to people rating this 4 or 5 and thus mediocre television care to fill us in on what you consider good television some of my favorite shows ever thus by definition i must give them 810 ratings are rome deadwood star trektos star trektng firefly nip tuck and torchwood got so far is easily on par with any of those edited by fippy darkpaw 26 april 2011  0920 pm"
"johnny",2011-04-26,"this was a step down from the first episode for me many of the scenes felt awkward as was the editing peter dinklage performance felt hammy the sex  rape scenes are getting to be a bit too much not that i find it offensive but theres only so many buttsex scenes i need to watch on a television show there are ways to imply these things without having to shove it in our faces constantly i agree with whoever said the dany scenes are a bit weak but then again they werent the most interesting in the book either the dothraki are disappointing i felt like the first episode was a great introduction to an epic movie this second one felt more like a tv show which it is apparently 710 edited by johnny 26 april 2011  1022 pm"
"Icewind",2011-04-27,"im usually not one to post on forums but this incredible book series brought to life in film inspired me to come to some sort of place to vent my feelings and have a voice having read all the books so far four times over im sure others out there have read them 6 8 and 10 times over i can say with confidence that i notice every little nuance and tittle that strays from the book things that dont precisely fit or follow script by the book or are out of place or dont feel right but the bottom line for me is this i think theyve done an excellent job in capturing the essence of what i feel when i read song of ice and fire the depth the emotions the character of characters i feel the same liking to all the characters in the movie that i felt when i read the books and the same bitterness as well some of the acting feels a little forced and maybe just maybe overdone at times but when i look at the grand scope of the acting and how well the actors seem to mesh together in this it captures the special feelings i felt from day one when the first book hit shelves and i picked it up and read it im highly impressed and for me im happy about that because movies in the past have been written about books and theyve fallen so flat on their face to me that it made me sad i ever touched the first product to begin with but i like game of thrones i think mr martin struck oil gold and coal with this hbo deal on to episode 2 i think it achieved a second height beyond what episode one did i think the acting was overall better the script hit the key points of the book better and the pivotal plot twists were executed very well of course in some places it wasnt verbatim but with the acting i saw it is forgivable to me episode two felt right more than right it felt good from the love scene between drogho and daenerys to the execution of lady by lord eddard stark episode two captured the feelings and rekindled the fire i felt when reading song of ice and fire forgive me if i elaborated on too many things at once in this episode two thread if the administrators or thread starter feel this post would be better placed somewhere else or busted up into a couple pieces i will understand just now getting a feel for this forum thing i only ask your patience and a little feedback and debate would be welcome too smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "

"Mistral",2011-04-27,"ive rated this one a 6 i felt it was weaker than the opening episode although there were several scenes i loved which redeemed it somewhat negatives whats peter dinklage doing with his diction he seems to overenunciate every word like a sixthformer doing shakespeare i like him in the part other than this and i hope he tones it down a bit as he settles into the role im finding kit harington quite wooden not enough of the sulky angst or simmering resentment i remember from the jon snow of the books kit spends much of the time looking faintly stunned and more than a little vacant joffrey i find it hard to believe that even naive sansa would fall so completely under the spell of this horrid little squirt it was plausible in the books because he was tallish for his age and storybookhandsome  she was able to remain blind to his true nature for quite some time in the show he is just pure odious small gripe but i was disappointed not to hear catelyn tell jon that it should have been him i felt the scene with sansa the hound and ilyn payne was fumbled somewhat it wasnt clear why she was frightened of either of them particularly felt a bit rushed and stuckinthere theon shockedgif classbbcemoticon altshocked  bad bad casting positives both of the direwolf attacks were well done sean bean was the best thing in this episode again i hope the rest of the cast improve their game soon because at the moment he is carrying it for me and that worries me arya thumbsupgif classbbcemoticon altthumbsup "

"cypselus",2011-04-27,"i gave it an 8 with some reservations just as in the book i dont care much for the daenerys storyline though viserys and mormont are wellportrayed most of the other performances are good kit harrington does not impress as jon im easily manipulated by sick kids and dying dogs so the episode grabbed me viscerally and finally something is starting to happen better than the first episode which just seemed rushed"
"arrowfan",2011-04-28,"ep2 810 i cant see how anyone could give a 6 or less rating i mean the casting is incredible production is tiptop and the story is  well its grrm i suppose the adaptation is whats left but even that is quite good i think game of thrones will have a lot of sleeper value anyway im thoroughly enjoying the hbo production ignore the gratuitous tits and its almost lotr does grrm"
"Carldog",2011-04-28,"first off ive enjoyed both episodes i gave this one an 80 85 really for three reasons 1 tyrion waking up in the dog pin is out of character for him and i didnt like that 2 the lack ghost i have a problem with 3 the chick on chick thing with dany and darea was a waste of time ill take more story over more sex very pleased over all"
"Direwolves are totally sweet",2011-04-28,"so far i think the acting has been superb just like the books sansas a little shit catelyn is vaguely nuts etc etc i suppose joffreys actor could have looked a little more 13 than 11 to fit with sansa looking older shes tall as hell but thats a tiny nit i think the lannister twins have been absolutely flawless so far no spoilers but theyve done a great job of hinting at some of the deeper plotlines going on that will continue to come to light as the series progresses my brother watched both with me having never read the books and directly asked me about something weve discussed ad nauseum over the years i disagree with the antidany actress stuff so far what a weird role to try to bring to film over 10 minutes of screen time so far but i feel like her interactions with drogo viserys and doreah have been very good at developing their characters with such limited time my biggest complaint is totally petty i feel like the hound should look more imposing scratchy voiced and brutal"
"Huan",2011-04-28,"i give it 8 out of 10 85 if it were possible when rewatching on dvr i fastforwarded through the catelyncersei and detective catelyn scenes every time just couldnt bear to watch them again wasnt a big fan of tyrion waking up with the dogs instead of reading all night and not sure how i feel about the jonjaime scene but i loved everything else the farewells were poignant and the kingsroad scenes were done about as well as i could have hoped barring ser ilyn payne who looks comical instead of deathly frightening sean bean is so good as ned stark"
"Papa Manderly's Meat Pie",2011-04-28,"i gave it a 7 gave the first episode an 8 as far as storyline and acting i thought everything was superb tyrion was excellent and arya once again was my favorite that being said i found the editingpacing to be a little off they did a much better job of that in the first episode there were some scenes that i felt lingered too long and became uncomfortable i hate it when that happens everyone is just standing around trying to look dramatic it works for a slit second but if the camera lingers it just starts to look posed if they were better with the editing they might be able to fit a whole other scene in ok maybe not but it would still help with the pacing i also still dont care for jon snow his acting seems a little wooden to me ive heard this is the weakest of the first 6 episodes though so if a 7 is the lowest number this season gets well that would be awesome"
"Tall Tyrion Lannister!",2011-04-28,"about a 85 or so way better than week 1"
"Triskan",2011-04-29,"yeah its almost as if the poll is being hosted on a fansite for the series the show is based on crazyi gave it a 9 arya made the show for me and tyrion followed that up those are my two favs in the book and they really make it shine herei also just gave it a nine and id agree that these two characters are the biggest stars they are absolute scenestealers every time but there are so many other good performances lena heady is so subtly good as a careful and crafty cercei ncw rocks as jaime too the girl playing sansa is great i had a bit of trouble with her at first just because she wasnt quite what i pictured in the books but shes doing an excellent job thus far but man tyrion and arya are just phenomenal mark addy never felt quite right to me as a casting i pictured robert as being an obvious exbasass from a physical warrior standpoint and addy doesnt quite capture that for me but im not worried about that any more he captures the character of robert so well really i am just so impressed by the cast i hope we see danys evolution and i think that we will i think the actress is doing a fantastic job with what shes given i just hope her character comes along a bit"
"Ran",2011-04-29,"its averaging 82 which i think is a pretty fair score most critics have been rating the episode 45 or a b and thats squarely in line with that"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-04-29,"i find it hard to rate this show im clearly more entertained by this than most other tv but im also more critical to what i watch than i am with things i havent already read any comparisons to whats been left in or cut out should be irrelevant i also prefer to rate entire seasons when were dealing with a continuing plot and not individual episodes if i tried it might reach a 9 primarily strengthened by the acting of some fantastic scenes i keep seeing things that increase my surprise on that several critics said that the second episode is the worst not only do i think its better than the first the second episode has been what has made every nonreader ive gotten to watch the show be completely enthralled by it they really liked the first as well but this was when they got truly sold"
"Tywin",2011-04-29,"758i liked the lannisters in this episode the most the banter between cersei jaime and tyrion at the table was topnotch and i liked the little look tyrion give jaime and cersei when they were looking between one another following the mention that bran might livei happen to like how dinklage speaks too he makes tyrion sound noble and posh sounding which i think fits the character well given he has has to be devious and eloquent to stand out morearyas actress is very goodpersonal grievancesno barristan and renly during the scene where ned finds arya in the hall i always liked the renly pisstaking bit where he makes fun of the name of joffreys sword lions toothjoffrey seems a bit i dont know off in places the bit where tyrion hits him hes fine the bit where hes talking about ilyn payne to sansa and he goes to touch her seemed a little wooden edited by tywin 29 april 2011  1138 am"
"Daenerys",2011-04-29,"a solid 8 overall very good but still feel off in some places when you go back to watch the first season of a tv series with a few years under its belt the first season sometimes two invariably seems a bit awkward compared with the later ones some shows that turned into classics such as seinfeld and star trek the next generation have first season episodes that are painful to watch in retrospect and you wonder how they got a second season approved the point being im thrilled that we have this kind of quality in the first few episodes of the first season it should only get better from here as the actors get comfortable with their characters and the directors and editors get a better feel for tone and pacing and so forth theyre not there yet but theres few really glaring problems for mewatching the series also has forced me to examine the books more critically and although they are still by far my favorite books i have to admit they arent perfect either theres sections that drag too much or dont feel relevant or authentic things i would have spent more time with or cut out being slavishly dedicated to the book is definitely not a good way to go harry potter movies went that route and suffered for it imo as long as they get the spirit of it right ill be happy and take it on its own merits and so far theyve succeeded"

"John (Snow) Doe",2011-05-02,"8 this was a powerful episode it had some real actionpacked exciting moments eg  brans direwolf scene that were missing last week a lot of critics are commenting on how powerful the ending  neds killing lady  was im glad that this scene struck a chord with nonreaders because i think it sets the tone for the series and offers a taste of whats to come since it resonated well so should the rest of the series if properly executed my personal favorite scene was the joncat interchange in brans room i found the music really powerful and the entire experience very exemplifying of the grit and bleakness that define this series im really pleasedrelieved that theyre sticking close to the source material"
"DecoyRunner",2011-05-04,"agree with the general sentiment that the casting is a little off theon seems too skinny cersei seems too old and jamie looks like a soap opera character ah well it was never going to be perfect im torn between anger that its being somewhat mistreated and just being grateful that it exists as a television series at all will they make it to a dream of spring probably not but its enough that they try"

"dark  sister",2012-01-07,"my favorite part which is strangely enough not in the books is what happens after they find arya sansa lies ned pleads cerseijoff gloat and ned has to kill lady basically there is some sort of connection for lack of a better word  between ladys death and brans rebirth i like the music that begins to play how ned plays with ladys ears then it slowly pans closer to brans bed and his eyes open when we hear the sword cut off ladys head i never looked at this exchange of death for life in this scene i personally believe it was probably the producers interpretation but i think it works really well in the scene the music is haunting too side note i love ramin djawadis music for the series hes iranian and im part iranian too and he really captures the haunting melodies that i personally love in music maybe its a persian thing winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  who knowsthe title music is probably the best ever heres a boy who did his own version of it on the violin instead of cello and i think he plays it wonderfully and with a lot of passionhttpwwwyoutubectureplppvideo"

"Smiler",2011-04-25,"i do find it odd that theon was included in the godswood scene but i liked how he so confidently pledged his peoples help that made me smirk knowing just how much help theon and his people are going to beactually in the book he was there for the discussion i dont have it with me but its basically the same scene in agot with catelyn rob maester l rodrick and theon when cat says she must go to kings landing rob draws his sword in anger and rodrick dresses him down for it which llewyn basically did the same thing in the hbo portrayal when rob talks about war in the book theon tells catelyn paraphrasing my lady my house owes a great debt to the starks which i always thought was extremely ironic given that ned and robert cast down theons father regarding the jaimejon scene in episode 2 i enjoyed it i thought it was very incharacter to how jaime tends to mock the young upstarts especially in asos like cleos frey and the crossbowman kid at the inn and even lorascount me amongst the ones who think it should have been you never really clicked i didnt miss it in the episode and i thought it was better handled in the hbo adaptation im not really a catelyn hater either though i dont think george intended readers to hate her but i dont know im not george i saw her as a character with good intentions who made some poor choices that escalated the war in reference to complaints about the development of the hound and other characters i think we all are forgetting that it took 2 to 3 books for us to really form our complete impressions of the characters at this point in the story the hound was really no more than a lapdog for joeffrey who made short jokes to tyrion and didnt seem to give a shit that he just ran down a butchers boy i dont think we get a good introduction to his character until he walks sansa home from the hands tournament edited by smiler 25 april 2011  0241 pm"

"Ser Latecomer",2011-04-26,"hi all longtime lurker but firsttime poster i read the novels for the first time last summer and immediately found this board afterwards anyways i finally decided to sign up and begin contributingmy only issue now is this how do they plan on fitting the whole of book 1 into 10 episodes i dont understand  were still at the part where bran wakes up lady dies and cat travels souththeres so much more yet to come is the 10 episode thing final or is it just a preliminary run until the producers decide the show is doing well enough to commission a complete season they do that sometimes  commission 13 episodes or so for a new show until they think the show has picked up a large enough fan following and then commission the rest of the seasoni am currently rereading agot in preparation for the adwd release in addition to wanting to have the text fresh in my mind while i watched the show i am reading on my kindle which has a handy feature of telling you what percentage of the book you have read through and i must admit surprise that the two episodes have so far ended on events almost exactly at the 10 and 20 points these episodes are so fastpaced they are covering a huge amount of information i have no doubt that they will fit all of the major plotpoints within a ten episode arc but like some other commenters i cant help but think that the pacing would feel much better if they had 1315 episodes to spread it out i hope they reconsider the ten episode format for future seasons"

"Eponine",2011-04-26,"ive been busy the past few days and its taken me this long to read all these pages and the previous ep 2 thread ill try to start in the middle of the discussion i enjoyed this episode much more than the previous my main complaint is that i think that the first half could have been edited so that the second half would feel less rushed the second half absolutely flew by im fine with a lot of changes that other people have mentioned i think that catelyn came across as hateful and cold to jon without it should have been you she was genuinely unpleasant when she told him to leave i dont see how anyone could construe it any other way aryas extra line she didnt hurt you much also wasnt necessary that scene was extremely effective as it was i do think that sansas aging up makes a big difference and makes her less sympathetic i think that if you imagine a child who looks to be the same age as maisie williams being brought before the king terrified instead of as aged up as sansa on tv there would be more sympathy for her not being willing to say anything also fine with no three eyed crow dream for now imo dreams should be used sparingly and bran has a long long long period of not being able to do much of anything his arc needs to be spread out so that he doesnt disappear from the show but doesnt become too repetitive addy as robert was great throughout the entire episode he conveyed perfectly how a man who was once bold and strong had become a wretched king not even willing to face his best friend when cersei demanded that lady be killed ladys death is the saddest thing in the entire series it would have been either horribly gruesome or ridiculously fake to show a man killing a wolf with a greatsword  the scene doesnt need to show all the maneuvering necessary to get a wolf in the right position to do that i wasnt crazy about either jaimes conversation with jon or with cerseis monologue to catelyn all the plot important parts that jaime made could have been part of jon and tyrions conversations a goodbye conversation between ned and jon could have reiterated the lifelong vow and the historical purpose of the nw either or both would have made more sense to me i would have preferred that cerseis speech be trimmed down by half she kept talking and talking and talking when almost every other scene had much shorter lines and less focus on just one character id have rather seen less of that and an extended scene with sansaaryajoffcourt which contained so much and moved so fast or maybe a little more context with sansailynsandor sandors comments to sansa kind of felt like they were coming out of nowhere and im not sure that id have understood what was happening with those three characters if i wasnt familiar with them already the only thing that took me totally out of the show was how clean drogo was i started laughing when i saw him walk in he just has this shiny scrubbed look while all the people in westeros seem to have accumulated a good layer of dirt i liked the line of dothraki riding though the grass thought the camp scene still looked kind of artificial and thought that the dany stuff was about as good as it could be  which isnt imo as good as the westeros side of things can be im not that interested in dany in the books and knowing that her arc is going to just stretch on and on before she interacts with any other povs is kind of discouraging i think the actors in her arc are doing a perfectly fine job but im not finding much excitement in it i felt the exact same way about her chapters in the book as i do about her segments in the show edited by eponine 26 april 2011  1129 pm"

"smegma",2011-04-28,"as far as changes to the characters personality goes i think this is a deliberate move on d  ds part i believe that we will see catelyn cersei and others exhibit a lot of character growth over the course of the show we know we have at least three seasons of cat four plus with cersei etc and if these characters didnt change much to the viewer it would be less interesting because theres no evolution of what we see its different in a book but on tv if the character stays the same from season one episode one to season three episode ten viewers will get bored maybe not bored but will be less compelled than if they witness it themselves over time so i imagine we will see cat exhibit her nobility and strength her political acumen etc  it just isnt immediately presented to the viewer drogos more caring side will be shown a few episodes into the series rather than immediately on the night of their wedding hbo is well renowned for their character arcs and it will be something that we will see expressed over time rather than all up front could i be wrong about this sure maybe they just keep the characters a great deal more onenote than what readers would expect and instead focus on the plot twists only but i would not be surprised if we get to see glimpses of the other sides of these characters so tired so if this is rambling i apologize"

"Mazikeen",2011-04-28,"not happy about tyrion waking up in the kennels instead of spending the night in the library perhaps its part of the different direction theyre giving the character in the show but for me it just doesnt add up with book tyrions sense of dignity and selfrespect yes he drinks and he gets drunk but not to the point of passing out in the doghouse and subjecting himself to even more ridicule and jons question later about why he reads so much makes less sense when we only see tyrion once with a book in his handa little disappointed about the dothraki costumes  where are the painted vestsafter watching the episode a second time i understand better the reason for the jaimiejon scene  it gives some background on the nights watch for nonreaderswhat i liked and wasnt talked to death about by other  i cannot abide the wailing of women  that line was perfectly delivered with a forced nonchalance as joffrey turns to the hound for approval we manly men lol women weak nudge nudge slap  i want you to leave  the entire scene was just excellent i am glad that it should have been you turned into this  benjens stark change after they leave winterfell no more smiling and laughing nights watch is srs bsnss  the doreahdany scene  the way dany shows a little boldness but backs up afterwards as if scared by her own daring some pretty nuanced character development going on with her i hope it continues  the look on drogos face when dany shows him new tricks  you want what now hm hold on ok this isnt so bad after allthe changes to catelyn and cersei are intriguing i am probably one of the few who liked book cat she is one of my favourite characters ill be interested to see how this cat evolves through the series overall i am very impressed with the series so far mad props to most of the actors looking forward to see more colourful costumes hopefully once we reach kings landing also direwolves "
"Huan",2011-04-28," i cannot abide the wailing of women  that line was perfectly delivered with a forced nonchalance as joffrey turns to the hound for approval we manly men lol women weak nudge nudge slapyes and i liked the hounds impassive face like he couldnt care less what joffrey had just said for that matter he actually couldnt care less poor joffrey is desperate for a father figure to approve of him and all he gets is mortification from robert later on in the episode"

"TerraPrime",2011-04-25,"as the episode stand in the tv series the only reason to think that she might not be sincere is that she was the one who witnessed the initial push one possible clue is in ep1 she mentioned to jaime her worries about jon arryns knowledge of the secret between her and jaime and she also urged jaime to do something upon the two of them being discovered by bran so given that its debatable whether shes genuine or not in the scene in ep2 with cat yet its still possible that that she is sincere at this point theres just no good way to tell without using material from the book that has yet to be shown in the tv series"

"Scion9",2011-04-25,"i feel like the investigation added to the show i always thought that the implication that the lannisters had something to do with brans condition was too much of an intuitive leap in the book i mean so a guy lit a fire to pull everyone out of the keep maybe he was just going to loot and a good place to start would be the resident nobles rooms as for cersei i just feel like what weve ween so far that they intend on portraying her differently on the show than they did in the books and she is in fact sincere and regrets what happened to bran that doesnt imply she wishes him to recover and implicate her sincerity doesnt imply altruism or a willingness to face justice shes sorry that it had to happen but it did have to happen"

"Loras",2011-04-26,"using the tv show as its own canon and separating my knowledge of the books yes cersei was sincere to my mind the story about her first born child does a number of things it humanises cersei she has been through the death of a child and it hurt her badly it is something that she doesnt want to go through again so i see the story as cerseis justification for what she had jaime do despite how guilty she feels as was mentioned in the initial twins scene in ep 1 if robert had known her secret then both her and jaime would be decorating the city gates to an extent cersei sees brans death as a necessary evil to protect her lover she also gets to show an understanding to catelyn  almost look i know what your going through which is a nice touch we understand more about the nature of cersei and roberts marriage he loved her at one point what i took from this was the emphasis on the anger and passion in their relationship which has now disappeared it leads viewers to wonder what happened to them as a couple especially when you consider the cold and occasionally callus way that he has treated her eg during the arrival at winterfell where he completely disregards her so that he can see lyannas crypt during the feast when he is molesting one of the serving women during the trial where he disregards her and her input the evolution of this relationship is something the adaptation is nailing imo headeys performance in this scene is fantastic she puts across the conflict within cersei very well she doesnt want bran to die but she cant risk him living her final line about the mother above was excellent well done all"

"alguien",2011-04-26,"i got the sense she was sincere given that its an entirely original scene my guess is that the shows creators are trying to portray cersei as a slightly grayer more neutral character than she is in the books there have been other differences also a fairly startling comment by headey that make me think it as wellhmmm now that i think about it all the mothers in the show so far are getting a bit more of a sympathetic depiction edited by alguien 26 april 2011  1152 am"
"Maia",2011-04-26,"imho they decided to portray cersei a little differently in the show and extended the timespan during which she gave robert the benefit of doubt after their marriage this dead baby and robert going to console himself with other women because he couldnt deal with grieving cersei would probably constitute the last straw for their relationship in the show as to explaining why it wasnt wellknown well it could be rationalized if naming day  birthday and if they tend to wait with naming of a child and widely announcing its birth for a few weeks which would make sense in this culture actually it can all be made to fit imho re cerseis sincerity id say that she does want bran to die and comes to check up on him but she also empathises and feels guilty in this scene that she started telling her story to feign sympathy but was carried away by emotion personally i welcome the sofar less mustachetwirling cersei i think that her exxagerated portrayal as a complete villainess is one of the few weaknesses of the series edited by maia 26 april 2011  0333 pm"

"The_Halfhand",2011-04-25,"overall i thought episode 2 was much better than the first one but still some changes really had me scratching my head 1 it should have been you again a great line that really nails the relationship between two characters completely disregarded for no good reason 2 tyrion waking up in the kennel would have liked to have seen him in the library so the whole why do you read so much line had more merrit but this change wasnt that bad overall 3 queen cercei going to see bran this was an odd scene to me yes it fleshes out cerceis character a bit but the notion that she ever would allow herself to birth a child of roberts is a complete left turn from the character as shes written in the books in the books she was so full of hate for robert she aborted the only child he ever impregnated her with an odd decision though i see why they did it 4 lack of direwolves in particular ghost seriously ghost is kinda important and yet hes nowhere to be seen you didnt even see him travelling with jon is he just gonna magically show up soon and no sight of grey wind or shaggydog or the fact bran hasnt named summer yet sigh 5 she didnt hurt you much again a great line left out for no real reason when arya says that to joffrey after nymeria attacks him it was such a great moment in the books it would have been great here and yet nada double sigh 6 no barriston the bold or renly guess theyre saving them for later but it would have been nice to introduce them along with illyn payne his introduction seemed rather odd and the hound didnt come off near as menacing to sansa as he should have 7 no dreams i guess theyre leaving the dreams out ofthe show would have been nice to see danys dream and brans 8 jon and tyrions scene again close but no cigar the writers seem dead set on not letting jon and tyrion have the great relationship they have in the books the whole most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it was so important because it made jon truely trust tyrion and tought him a valuable lesson but alas instead we get extra dialogue about the kingslayer that plus no ghost and no introduction to yoren who does play an important roll later overall i thought the scenes with danny were handled well and the episode as a whole moved better than the pilot the whole catelyn investigation into the tower where bran fell was a little odd but i can see it was necesasary would have liked to have heard more explanation about the conspiracty to kill bran like they had in the books but its not a big deal they got across what they needed to hopefully they stick closer to the books as the series goes on"

"BlackStoneCA",2011-04-25,"more then a few people pointed out the lack of dire wolves on screen as compared to the books we have to keep in mind that it is easy to write having creatures with animal or higher intelligence doing amazing things on print much more difficult to transition that to real life for a tv show and using actual real live animals that do have a mind of their own it was commented back in the episode 1 discussion there were issues with the dogs they were using for the dire wolves and getting them to do what they wanted them to do which is why some of them are not having the screen time or are not present on screen in scenes where they did appear in the books as to the rest of the changes they might be trying to make cat more appealing and have the audience relate to her more which is why she was not so cruel to jon in the scene also it is the only time they are with one another so its not that huge a deal we know she dislikes jon resents him i also didnt think the scene with arya and jeoff lacked anything it was clear with the non verbal dialog to me"

"The_Halfhand",2011-04-25,"i think you overstate the importance of that line we havent had much build up in the dislike cat has for jon and to suddenly go from moderately subtle to all guns blazing could very well seem a bit odd especially since it never leads anywherein the book when jon is saying goodbye to bran grrm writes it in such a way where it seems like catelyn actually is touched by jons farewell so when she calls out his name before he leaves you feel like there will be some type of redemption there but instead the line is so shocking because it shows how much of a stoneheart catelyn really is and this goes towards her turning into such an evil creature later after shes killed i actually think that line was very important i think the scene actually depicts something else cersei so cold and calculating that she can stand and lie into the face of the mother of he child she has indirectly tried to kill to me the lie was fairly obvious given the extreme difference to what she said to tyrion about brans life i think she just needed to assess the situation with her own eyes plus that she of course helps remove suspicions by acting respectful in griefshe wasnt lying though why would she lie about having a dark haired child i think this was added to set up the kings sons mystery more than anything cercei might be a cold conniving woman but remember in the books she didnt want jamie to kill bran and she wasnt the one who killed jon arryn she does have a few scruples though they seem to go away as she grasps for more powerdont nitpick on the show when you dont remember the book bran doesnt name summer until after hes woken from his comayou misread my post i know he doesnt name his wolf until after he wakes up but theres been nothing about him being unable to name his direwolf so far a simple line from rob saying something like and bran was never able to think of a name for his wolf would have sufficed it was important that everyone had named their wolves but bran and why the eventual choice of the name summer was so important as well but here they just gloss over it they didnt even talk about how the wolves would wail constantly since bran fell and how hearing them seemed to give him strength just a few lines of dialogue in the show could convey this but for some reason the producers dont feel the need to layer in these important bits which they could easily doyou havent even seen all the footage of them talking yet so i think youre way too premature in your criticism weve already seen in plenty of previews that they talk more at castle black than they do in the book i dont really get your comment about them getting a great relationship since in the book they hardly even talk until they meet by chance the day before tyrion is leaving i would expect a great relationship to be a lot more vibrant than that i wouldnt go further than to call it mutual respectum ive seen plenty in the two scenes theyve shared major bits of dialogue have been left out i know that the producers gave tyrion a lot of donnel noyes lines at the wall but the bit where tyrion tells jon about the hard truths plays into why he helps samwell out later on i guess they could rearrange the dialogue to have that come later but it was conspicuous in its absense you really see jon and tyrions friendship grow in the book culminating in that final chance meeting on the top of the wall so far i dont see the connection being that strong jon seems far too sulleni think your expected standards are a bit over whats realistic so i wouldnt keep my hopes too high if i were you having high expectations is the best way to not be entertainedthese are my favorite books of all time long have i imagined what they would be like if they became a movie or tv show and some of the best moments  little lines of dialgue and small details  are being left out and i just dont understand why they can wordforword have tyrion recite what he wants for breakfast in the book but when it comes to major scenes they gotta change stuff it just makes no sense to me maybe if i could hear the producers views on this stuff it might make a difference im still watching the show and enjoying it but these small changes really take me out of the viewer mindset and make me instantly critical the whole time with arya and joffrey i was waiting for her to say she didnt hurt you much i was on the edge of my seat yelling say it say it and then she just sullenly looks at joff and tosses the sword in the river it was such a let down especially since it was one simple line of dialogue that could have easily been addedhowever i did like all the danny scenes this episode it was essentially 1 danny chapter spread out over the course of the show and that pacing seemed good since we got all the information we needed and the final lovemaking scene between danny and drago hit all the right notes for their relationship makes me think that if the producers had a little more time they could really be nailing the tone and intent of the books but they seem rushed to fit so much story into 10 hours edited by thehalfhand 25 april 2011  1218 pm"

"Snow White",2011-04-25,"she wasnt lying though why would she lie about having a dark haired child i think this was added to set up the kings sons mystery more than anything cercei might be a cold conniving woman but remember in the books she didnt want jamie to kill bran and she wasnt the one who killed jon arryn she does have a few scruples though they seem to go away as she grasps for more powerthis surprised me also but its a clue to nonreaders who dont have quite as much to go onyou misread my post i know he doesnt name his wolf until after he wakes up but theres been nothing about him being unable to name his direwolf so far a simple line from rob saying something like and bran was never able to think of a name for his wolf would have sufficed it was important that everyone had named their wolves but bran and why the eventual choice of the name summer was so important as well but here they just gloss over it they didnt even talk about how the wolves would wail constantly since bran fell and how hearing them seemed to give him strength just a few lines of dialogue in the show could convey this but for some reason the producers dont feel the need to layer in these important bits which they could easily dothey dont talk about the wolves howling well cat did we hear them howling thats how you do it in a tv showand really wasnt the important bit that bran named summer after he awoke and not that it had taken him so long"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-04-25,"in the book when jon is saying goodbye to bran grrm writes it in such a way where it seems like catelyn actually is touched by jons farewell so when she calls out his name before he leaves you feel like there will be some type of redemption there but instead the line is so shocking because it shows how much of a stoneheart catelyn really is and this goes towards her turning into such an evil creature later after shes killed i actually think that line was very importantwe disagree on the importance of that then i didnt think she was warming up to jon in the book but thats a side noteshe wasnt lying though why would she lie about having a dark haired child i think this was added to set up the kings sons mystery more than anything cercei might be a cold conniving woman but remember in the books she didnt want jamie to kill bran and she wasnt the one who killed jon arryn she does have a few scruples though they seem to go away as she grasps for more poweruntil i see something that makes it clearly deviate from the book i will take it as that she was lying something thats certainly within her character well see as the show goes on she lost a child but she didnt want to have itshe didnt want jaime to kill bran but she did want bran to die when the deed was already done which she also clearly confesses to her brothers killing someone and wishing someone already subjected to attempted murder to die are not the same thingsyou misread my post i know he doesnt name his wolf until after he wakes up but theres been nothing about him being unable to name his direwolf so far a simple line from rob saying something like and bran was never able to think of a name for his wolf would have sufficed it was important that everyone had named their wolves but bran and why the eventual choice of the name summer was so important as well but here they just gloss over it they didnt even talk about how the wolves would wail constantly since bran fell and how hearing them seemed to give him strength just a few lines of dialogue in the show could convey this but for some reason the producers dont feel the need to layer in these important bits which they could easily doyes i see how you meant it now but we have vastly different opinions on whats important then bran not naming his wolf for a while is not important in my view its not even important that the direwolf is named summer things that are important are that bran likes to climb and gets thrown out a window that tyrion is a dwarf etc bran naming summer is a small detail that doesnt affect the plot at all and there are lots of other similar details that have been left out and some have been put in they have to choose note that im talking about important in a general sense as what details are important to us personally differ and are not something thats relevant to how they make the showand the wolves were howling and they dont really need to talk about what we already hear again its not important to the plot exactly why so they dont have to to point that out for the new viewers this is a clear case of where the book can be used as a companion to the series ie where you get more understanding of details by having read itum ive seen plenty in the two scenes theyve shared major bits of dialogue have been left out i know that the producers gave tyrion a lot of donnel noyes lines at the wall but the bit where tyrion tells jon about the hard truths plays into why he helps samwell out later on i guess they could rearrange the dialogue to have that come later but it was conspicuous in its absense you really see jon and tyrions friendship grow in the book culminating in that final chance meeting on the top of the wall so far i dont see the connection being that strong jon seems far too sullenmajor bits of dialog has been left out everywhere so thats hardly a surprise and tyrion having donal noyes lines plays on the education part in a similar manner and we disagree about their friendship we get to see what they are thinking about in the book and none of them thinks about the other after theyve parted hardly a sign of a great friendshipthese are my favorite books of all time long have i imagined what they would be like if they became a movie or tv show and some of the best moments  little lines of dialgue and small details  are being left out and i just dont understand why they can wordforword have tyrion recite what he wants for breakfast in the book but when it comes to major scenes they gotta change stuff it just makes no sense to me maybe if i could hear the producers views on this stuff it might make a difference im still watching the show and enjoying it but these small changes really take me out of the viewer mindset and make me instantly critical the whole time with arya and joffrey i was waiting for her to say she didnt hurt you much i was on the edge of my seat yelling say it say it and then she just sullenly looks at joff and tosses the sword in the river it was such a let down especially since it was one simple line of dialogue that could have easily been addedim not criticizing you about it just saying that i think your expectations are a bit too high to be able to fully enjoy it for what it is as friendly advice these are my favorite books as well and im watching this with fairly good knowledge of how adaptations are made and how they usually turn out that makes it so im rather pleasantly surprised at every detail thats left in rather than annoyed at everything i like in the book thats left out pretty much every fantasy series before this has been far worse than this so i dont think what weve gotten was even realistic to expect so if ive heard she didnt hurt you much id have thought cool they got that in even though i dont think that particular line is one of martins better rather than be annoyed when it wasnt left inwhats important in an adaptation is keeping true to the spirit not making things play out exactly like the original i want an artistic adaptation that becomes its own entity when i watch this if i want to make sure i get to hear my favorite lines from the book ill read that againhowever i did like all the danny scenes this episode it was essentially 1 danny chapter spread out over the course of the show and that pacing seemed good since we got all the information we needed and the final lovemaking scene between danny and drago hit all the right notes for their relationship makes me think that if the producers had a little more time they could really be nailing the tone and intent of the books but they seem rushed to fit so much story into 10 hoursyes thats exactly the issue they have to pick and choose by so many things that are in the book together with making their own thing at times things are explained in dialog in the book where you can just suffice with the fact that in the show you actually have visuals that speak for you 10 hours is a short amount of time to tell whats on 700 pages of a pretty intricate story this far they are doing clearly better than i thought they wouldfrom what weve heard the pace is the highest in the first two episodes at least out of the first six so hopefully things will get even better"
"The Brandon Stark",2011-04-25,"bran not saying his name is summer is really not an issue in fact it would be off base seeing as how we dont have brans inner thoughts remember it was bran in his climbing chapter that actually gives all the names of the pups he thinks rickons is silly also same of arya and sansas names but wished he thought of grey wind and ghost although knows ghost wouldnt be a good name for his"
"TreeTree",2011-04-25,"overall i thought episode 2 was much better than the first one but still some changes really had me scratching my head1 it should have been youagain a great line that really nails the relationship between two characters completely disregarded for no good reason3 queen cercei going to see branthis was an odd scene to me yes it fleshes out cerceis character a bit but the notion that she ever would allow herself to birth a child of roberts is a complete left turn from the character as shes written in the books in the books she was so full of hate for robert she aborted the only child he ever impregnated her with an odd decision though i see why they did itanother thing i noticed about catelyn in the show was that she acted really whiny about ned leaving in the book she was much stronger about it because she knew it had to be done especially after the letter she received from her sister she never threw it in his face that he had to be the kings hand in the show she whined about him making a choice he didnt have to make as far as the queen goes i like my cersei cold hard and as bitchy as possible i didnt appreciate the tender moment bullshit in brans sickroom are they trying to make us like the character if so why this leads me to believe that they will indeed take cerseis character in a different direction from the book in future episodes i do still love the show but i dont see the reason for the subtle changes so sue me im a purist edited by treetree 25 april 2011  0355 pm"
"TreeTree",2011-04-25,"i think you overstate the importance of that line we havent had much build up in the dislike cat has for jon and to suddenly go from moderately subtle to all guns blazing could very well seem a bit odd especially since it never leads anywherei think the scene actually depicts something else cersei so cold and calculating that she can stand and lie into the face of the mother of he child she has indirectly tried to kill to me the lie was fairly obvious given the extreme difference to what she said to tyrion about brans life i think she just needed to assess the situation with her own eyes plus that she of course helps remove suspicions by acting respectful in griefim with you on the catelyn line i dont think it was necessary either she told jon to get out which shows that she hates him and even talked about it with ned what more do we needon the other hand i dont think the scene with cersei was a good addition it wasnt an obvious lie to me it seemed like they were trying to make her likable the best thing about cersei is that shes so unlikable to go to brans room and say shes praying for him blah blah blah is one thing i would believe that as a lie considering the other scenes but to show real emotion over her own dead child seems like too much of a variation from the book and misleads people who havent read them im wondering if they are trying to change her for the show since in one of the preshow specials the actress said that she thinks cersei really did love robert at one time all of us know that isnt true what book did she read"
"Blue Steel",2011-04-25,"it should have been you was a cliched and over the top im glad they kept it out it would have been so cheesy"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-04-25,"im with you on the catelyn line i dont think it was necessary either she told jon to get out which shows that she hates him and even talked about it with ned what more do we needon the other hand i dont think the scene with cersei was a good addition it wasnt an obvious lie to me it seemed like they were trying to make her likable the best thing about cersei is that shes so unlikable to go to brans room and say shes praying for him blah blah blah is one thing i would believe that as a lie considering the other scenes but to show real emotion over her own dead child seems like too much of a variation from the book and misleads people who havent read them im wondering if they are trying to change her for the show since in one of the preshow specials the actress said that she thinks cersei really did love robert at one time all of us know that isnt true what book did she readtheres definitely room for interpretation but since shes so cold in wising bran dead just a while earlier i see it as her being extraordinarily adept at trickery as for her character i dont think shes that unlikeable in the books once we actually get to know her a bit i feel more pity than dislike the show will show us more of how characters really are since were not just seeing stark enemies from stark eyes were seeing them for what they are like we do with jaime and cersei later in the book series as for cersei loving robert i dont think thats far fetched at all in affc we do learn that she thought robert was handsome and heroic before they wed perhaps transferring her feelings for rhaegar to him so it seems like she was at some point open to the possibility of that it could work well when it didnt work she starts loathing him blaming him for killing rhaegar and falling back to her true comfort jaimeas for what book lena read none shes only read the script because she thinks thats the best way to go about this"
"Balefont",2011-04-25,"as for what book lena read none shes only read the script because she thinks thats the best way to go about thisi think given her character arc this may actually be a wise choice"
"Civfan",2011-04-25,"this was an odd scene to me yes it fleshes out cerceis character a bit but the notion that she ever would allow herself to birth a child of roberts is a complete left turn from the character as shes written in the books in the books she was so full of hate for robert she aborted the only child he ever impregnated her with an odd decision though i see why they did iti think i mentioned this in another thread but i was thinking she killed the baby maybe theyll clear that up later i figured it was to both mention the dark hairlight hair thing and to replace her aborting the baby"
"The_Halfhand",2011-04-25,"we disagree on the importance of that then i didnt think she was warming up to jon in the book but thats a side noteshe wasnt but it seemed like it in that scene read it

into the heart of winter is pretty important if you ask me theres a lot of symbolism there and brans relationship with summer is probably the most important one in the books next to jon and ghost i think thats my biggest criticism of the show is that they strip out all the nuance and symbolism that could easily be layered into the narrativeand the wolves were howling and they dont really need to

"Ser Luke",2011-04-25,"did that conversation between jaime and jon happen in the books i dont have them handy and i dont remember it"
"Winterfelled",2011-04-25,"it seems like people are expecting a shotforshot remake of the books this same kind of unnecessary whining happened during the lotr movies so im not surprised but its still frustrating even though its not television its hbo its still a television series and the rules are different than in literature they didnt simply make this show for georges readership they are counting on some new fans who havent and likely never will read the books to becoming regular viewers while i would have liked to see cat say it should have been you i totally understand why they changed it shes a major sympathetic character and viewers are going to have a hard time rooting for someone who just wished that kind of harm on an innocent teenager as horrible as it was to read in the books its even worse to see happen and i understand why it was probably too big of a risk the nature of their relationship was framed perfectly by the replacement line this episode in my opinion blew the first one away it was head and shoulders above the first the drama was high the knife scene was excellent and believable and they made the direwolf saving bran look great when so many animalhuman action scenes especially on tv come off badly im so bummed sean bean wont be a bigger part of the series the scene when the hound another great performance by the way is walking his horse with the butchers boy draped over the back and ned says you ran him down the pain and horror in seans voice anchored the whole episode you could really feel his frustration and confusion in that one sentence absolutely brilliant"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-04-25,"she wasnt but it seemed like it in that scene read it again youll see what i mean i guess in the overall view of the story its a small thing but its those little details that make the books so enjoyablei remember what youre referring to as i read the book recently i fully agree that a lot of what makes the books truly great are in the details unfortunately we just wont see all of them in the showthats already a clear deviation from the book but it seems to me that cercei loves her children and she wouldnt kill her own child if it had already been bornyes i was referring specifically to that cersei had been pregnant with roberts child i just watched the behind the episode video and they touched on this subject they didnt say anything definitive i guess its up to each viewer to decide but they felt that she was in part honest and in part deceitful in that scenesure she wanted bran to die after the fact because she was worried about what he might say but she didnt send the assassin after him and if you remember from the books she was very upset with jamie over what he did so its not out of character for her to be sad over what happened to branyes i never said that she was so anxious for him to die that she would do something about it i just noted her wish as for the scene above i think she was mainly sad when she thought of her own child and more deceitful and scouting when it came to bran but as said its for each of us to decide until the show gives us any direct answer thats the beauty of art that a part is created when every individual experiences ityes i heard the wolves howling but there was no context to it for those who havent read the books the didnt know catelyn had banned the wolves from the tower they didnt know they had been howling since brans fall they didnt know bran seemed to do better when he could hear them howl my point is it would not have been hard to explain these things and give them more meaning that and the howls were awful soft so if you werent listening for them they could be easily overlookedyes the nonreaders will not get everything like that i dont really agree that they could have included all the details you mention well though as it would make the scene awfully chatty with little breathing space to let the emotions sink in but thats just my opinioni dont think anyone actually missed the howling though as cat freaked out and told robb to shut the window so the sound would stopyou can disagree all you like but its made clear in the books that they form a friendship from the time they spent together the handshake remember this friendship is referenced a few times in the other books and will no doubt pay off much later in the series when tyrion jon and danny all come together i dont mind changing dialogue or cutting stuff but there are signature lines from the books that can easily be includedn in the show but for some reason are left out it just makes me scratch my head confusedi can and i will i think they found respect for each other and saw some of themselves in the other but i dont see that part being hard to tell with what ive already seen if jon and tyrion meet again i dont see them acting like they are seeing a dear friend for the first time in years i see them having trust and keep building on their relationship when it comes to jon and deep friendship i think of samthen you watch the show differently than i do the books are damn near perfect in my opinion and theyre doing a good job of adapting them but some of their changes make no sense to me hopefully there will be commentaries on the dvds to explain why they made the changes they didi dont go as far as to call them near perfection although they are still the best ive read all in all as for explaining things as why a certain line wasnt included i cant fuel your hopes with my expectations since i dont see them going into detail about that if they talk about specific lines theyll be talking about lines that are in the show i suppose you could try to get a question about a specific line or two through if someone thats about to interview them are taking questions from fans though like ran recently didi agree but the more faithful they can stay to the books the better the adaptation will be i can see them doing stuff like this for a movie version but they have a lot of time to play with in a tv show and part of what make the books so enjoyable are these signature moments that martin layers in there so if you think its cool they can take tyrions breakfast order wordforword from the book but leave out lines that carry a powerful impact and set up things later in the series thats a matter of your taste versus minei agree with the change to the more faithful they can be to the spirit of the books making an adaptation that follows a novel word for word is commonly seen as a bad way to do it something george has said as welland yes im fine with that scene its not much more than 10 seconds that shows us a bit of what they are eating in the north it visually shows us a hall of winterfell and is a nice lead in to the breakfast discussion i dont think the quality of the episode had been any better if they took those 10 seconds and explained that cat didnt allow summer to be in brans room and if i were to do such time puzzles with the episode id be sitting here for hours given the amount of lines that are not in the show its unfortunate for you if your entertainment gets diminished by lines you know that arent contradicted but not just said with that mindset theres not really much you can do to mitigate itim sure the show will get better as time goes on but its not the fact theyre making changes that annoys me its that they eliminate simple things they could easily include in the show to make it richer and more faithful to the books and yet they leave them outgeaorge martin said when he wrote his episode it was easy because he just took what was already on the page and put it into screenplay form makes me wonder why the other writers couldnt do the same thingputting it in screenplay form doesnt mean writing the same thing on another paper it means adapting dialog and everything else to fit to the scenes i dont really see the point in critiquing georges episode and others in comparison to it before its been aired george has also said that the other screenwriters have been very faithful to his work so theres nothing saying that his will be significantly different if we just go by a few sentences hes happened to have said well get the actual result in a few weeksits also interesting to see that when we look at the reviews of the first six episodes the scene readers and nonreaders alike have praised the most has been one thats completely new"
"sonny",2011-04-25,"another thing i noticed about catelyn in the show was that she acted really whiny about ned leaving in the book she was much stronger about it because she knew it had to be done especially after the letter she received from her sister she never threw it in his face that he had to be the kings hand in the show she whined about him making a choice he didnt have to make incorrect ser after bran fell she begged ned not to go and was initially bitter about it its not written out in dialogue but her narration makes it quite clear he had no choice he had told her and then left choosing i actually appreciated this version better because she didnt want him to go from the start instead of being all for it and then all against it i thought the book version made her seem more irrationali also thought that whole it should have been you line was ridiculous in the book and didnt do her any favors i think the actress looked angry enough at jons presence without having that bit of melodrama in there"
"Inglorious Pencil",2011-04-25,"i think they found respect for each other and saw some of themselves in the other but i dont see that part being hard to tell with what ive already seen if jon and tyrion meet again i dont see them acting like they are seeing a dear friend for the first time in years i see them having trust and keep building on their relationship when it comes to jon and deep friendship i think of sami agree actually i think that its true to life  a meaningful encounter like that between jon and tyrion doesnt necessarily translate into friendship i think their relationship represents of those situations where a complete outsider rather than the people who have been by your side your whole life says the right thing at the right moment and makes you have an epiphany of sorts if anything tyrion is more of an inspiration than a friend to jonits also interesting to see that when we look at the reviews of the first six episodes the scene readers and nonreaders alike have praised the most has been one thats completely newto be honest while im kind of bothered by some things that have been changed  ie catelyns characterization and perhaps cerseis though well have to see how that plays out in the future  i appreciated most of the additions so far maybe because they bring an element of surprise even after years spent in this fandom smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "

"The_Halfhand",2011-04-25,"i remember what youre referring to as i read the book recently i fully agree that a lot of what makes the books truly great are in the details unfortunately we just wont see all of them in the showi can understand them leaving some things out but the ones i mentioned are specifically important to character arcs or future stories in the series and they could so easily be added i think thats the point im trying to make i dont expect a wordforword adaptation and i dont mind them adding and subtracting stuff but theres so much signature stuff theyre leaving out that could easily be added thats what concerns me mostyes the nonreaders will not get everything like that i dont really agree that they could have included all the details you mention well though as it would make the scene awfully chatty with little breathing space to let the emotions sink in but thats just my opinionit would only require a few lines of dialogue if you dumped a largely unnecessary scene like jamie and jon by the forge and include a scene about how the family is dealing with brans fall you could easily get all of that across but i guess showing jamie being a prick is more important that the starks mourning over bran and exploring the strange relationship they have with their wolves shrugi can and i will i think they found respect for each other and saw some of themselves in the other but i dont see that part being hard to tell with what ive already seen if jon and tyrion meet again i dont see them acting like they are seeing a dear friend for the first time in years i see them having trust and keep building on their relationship when it comes to jon and deep friendship i think of samfrom page 213 of the paperbackthank you my lord of lannister he pulled off his glove and offered his bare hand friendtyrion found himself oddly touched most of my kin are bastards he said with a wry smile but youre the first ive had to friend he pulled a glove off with his teeth and clasped snow by the hand flesh against flesh the boys grip was firm and strongyes jon is better friends with sam and grenn and pyp etc but make no mistake he is friends with tyrion as well and its because the dwarf gave him such good council and the lessons tyrion gave jon help form him into the man he becomes thats why id like to see their scenes together stick closer to what they are in the book because they will not be together again for a long long timei agree with the change to the more faithful they can be to the spirit of the books making an adaptation that follows a novel word for word is commonly seen as a bad way to do it something george has said as welland i dont expect a wordforword adaptation but i expect them to know what fans want to see and work it into the show a lot of the stuff they are leaving out is stuff that would make fans of the books squeeeeeeee so its just odd that theyre leaving so much of it out in favor of other things that arent necessaryand yes im fine with that scene its not much more than 10 seconds that shows us a bit of what they are eating in the north it visually shows us a hall of winterfell and is a nice lead in to the breakfast discussionheres the thing though  im fine with the scene as well because its almost verbatum from the book down to the breakfast order so why cant they do that with other scenes when it can be done just as easily thats my point you could easily cut tyrion ordering breakfast and slip in another quick scene about the direwolves lets say and still get across the same information but they chose to stick to the book exactly for that scene and not others why i dont mind hearing tyrion asking for burned bacon but when so much other stuff is left out for no good reason it makes me wonder where the writers priorities liei dont think the quality of the episode had been any better if they took those 10 seconds and explained that cat didnt allow summer to be in brans room and if i were to do such time puzzles with the episode id be sitting here for hours given the amount of lines that are not in the show its unfortunate for you if your entertainment gets diminished by lines you know that arent contradicted but not just said with that mindset theres not really much you can do to mitigate iti disagree i think the quality would have been much better the more information and backstory they could have put in i do enjoy the show but not as much as i would if they could hit all the right beats to itputting it in screenplay form doesnt mean writing the same thing on another paper it means adapting dialog and everything else to fit to the scenes i dont really see the point in critiquing georges episode and others in comparison to it before its been aired george has also said that the other screenwriters have been very faithful to his work so theres nothing saying that his will be significantly different if we just go by a few sentences hes happened to have said well get the actual result in a few weeksive adapted books and stories for screenplays before so im aware of what goes into it keep in mind i dont mind changes and new additions but i do mind editing out awesome stuff from the book that could easily be in the show see my point its not enough to ruin the show but it is enough to annoy a fan of the books just sayingits also interesting to see that when we look at the reviews of the first six episodes the scene readers and nonreaders alike have praised the most has been one thats completely newnot sure what scene youre referring to but its easy to praise a new scene because theres nothing to be disappointed by from it the direwolf scene was horribly handled and theyre making jon far to sullen tyrions scenes are changed too much for my liking especially when hes with jon but whatever the show is still good i just would like to see them stick a little closer to the book in the details if a show like lost can layer in all kinds of easter eggs and subtlety im sure this show can do that because its far better than lostalso keep in mind the purpose of this thread is to highlight what was different from the books to the episode not a true critique of the episode so you can argue with me about the quality of the show but you cant argue over what they decided to leave in and leave out "

"KyleLitke",2011-04-26,"id wait til the beginning of next episode before id totally discount brans dream anyway they could pick up from a few minutes before he wakes up they may also skip the dream and just describe it which for now would be fine theres no real way to do the dream in that episode and have it work not without totally changing the episodes ending they went with a dramatic juxtaposition of lady dying as bran wakes up if you show the dream how do you do that you cant cut away from the whole thing with lady to suddenly show this random crow dream then cut back to it then bran waking updoesnt work you could have i suppose done the buildup then cut to the dream then brans eyes opening but not with him naming summer thats an episode ending line not a pre lady death line then gone to ned killing lady but eh i thought the way they handled it worked and if youre doing it that way the dream doesnt fit and would have entirely taken viewers out of the moment kind of the same thing with his name is summer it would have been really weird to do it the way it happened in the book bran doesnt just suddenly wake up and blurt out to absolutely nobody his name is summer he wakes up then someone notices hes awake then they run out of the room then they go get robb then robb comes in and then bran tells him that he named the direwolf summer how would you suggest they do it bran randomly wakes up yelling summer to himself or they do the dramatic death of lady then cut away to a minute or two long scene where they go run and get robb neither one works i was looking for it too but it just doesnt work with the way they wanted to do the episode and frankly if the next episode starts with robb coming in and bran telling him its actually perfectly in line with what happened in the books they just cut the episode off as his eyes open rather than as robb runs in"

"Loras",2011-04-26,"wait wait wait you really think the intention is to totally gut brans character and that its not more likely that theyre just going to tell that story some way other than showing a small boy falling through the air conversing with a talking crow like nobody had the idea that maybe that scene would come off better if bran just told someone like maester luwin about it instead of the audience living it with him because it would look so good on tvi agree i think that brans dreams are the exception to the show dont tell rule the show is trying to establish a realistic world which has multiple layers to engage with the viewers who would dismiss it as a fantasy show i think his dreams would be very off putting at this early stage but i wouldnt be surprised if we saw them later after a significant amount of world building has been done i think it is important to show that most of the characters would dismiss brans dreams but that bran himself believes even that aspect adds depth to the tone of the show"

"Ser Greguh",2011-04-26,"the dreams obviously werent shown in the second episode because there simply wasnt the rhythm for them having bran wake up the instant lady is killed conveys much the same message that the dreams did that there is something off something supernatural something very very important going on and that bran is in touch with it and they can include dreams at other points to emphasize brans role in things to come conversations he will have in the future likely with osha and luwyn will only reinforce that those who think omg they didnt show the threeeyed crow while bran was in a coma storyline ruined are severely lacking in imagination imo"
"Solmyr",2011-04-26,"the show is trying to establish a realistic world which has multiple layers to engage with the viewers who would dismiss it as a fantasy showdead rising and supernatural beings wielding swords of ice in the very first scene of the pilot episode the camera zooming over some dragons eggs 34 times per episode even nonreaders are 99 certain there will be dragons soon it seems to me the director is desperate to stress the show has fantasy elements in it brans dream is no more fantastical than zombies supernatural beings made of ice or dragonsthanks for the info ran looking forward to dismissing my fears"

"Derfel Cadarn",2011-04-26,"i was a bit disappointed of the naming but i do understand why they didnt film the three eyed crow they will probably speak of the crow later on and bran will tell luwin or someone about his dream i think that will be both easier and better for a television adaption if they do leave out the crow although i dont believe they will i will be very disappointedit would have been a mistake to show the crow dream in ep2 if we had the dream it would have killed the suspsense as to whether or not bran would die it was more dramatic to show his eyes open they may well show it or refer to it in ep3"

"Solmyr",2011-04-26,"the only thing that has truly resonated with me so far is arya1"
"The_Halfhand",2011-04-26,"the problems become clearer when you notice that many of the people wishing that things had been added are wishing for different thingspeople will wish for the things they like im wishing they kept in the iconic stuff and the important stuff i have lots of friends who watch the show but have never read the books they love the show but they get confused about stuff and then ask me to clarify so i have to tell them well in the books they explain this and then theyre like ahhhh but a good adaptation shouldnt have people asking those questions thats why i would like to see some of this important stuff layered into the showjaime will be a more important character in the show than he is in the first book also a meeting between him and jon that could have taken place in the book but was never shown is intriguing to meman if you want to go that route there are a lot of scenes that could have taken place in the book but were never shown i personally feel that if grrm had wanted scenes like that in the book he would have written them in therenow that doesnt mean im against adding scenes like this to the show but not at the expense of some of the wellthoughtout character beats that martin had written into the story you could have easily cut that jamiejon scene and put in a scene explaining how the wolves were reacting to brans fall and never ever have missed itim sure well get plenty of jamie this season next season id like to see how they work him in since he doesnt reappear until the end of the second book im sure well get a jamie tries a jailbreak subplot or something ridiculous just to keep him active in the showit gives me something new instead of just the same thing ive already read as for the family dealing with brans death i think that comes across well for many of them without them having to state it too clearly you cant tell everything too clearly or the show will look like it doesnt think the viewers are very bright the connection with the wolves is most important for bran and that can very well be explained more further on theres nothing forcing them to explain things in the exact same order that the book doesyoure correct but my issue comes with the fact that the scenes that make the most sense and would have the most impact with that information available have pretty much already passedmartin makes everything very clear in the book and it doesnt talk down to the reader the writers could easily take whats on the page and add it to the show and not come across like theyre talking down to the viewers but stuff like arya saying thats jamie lannister the queens twin brother is obvious exposition and clumsily done at that nothing like that was in the books thats for sureas ive said you can enjoy the show thats fine but im pointing out what was left out from the books and why it would have been better had they found a way to add that stuff ini think theres a lot of difference in calling someone friend like that which is basically a sign of respect and understanding and deep friendship as you described it as for tyrions council we have heard jon say that no one told him the truth but him we dont see tyrion but its obvious that hes talking to him and that tyrion gives more advice than he does in the book so the relationship that forms between them will most likely be very clear to the audience i dont think the relationship hangs on any one line of dialog its better written than thatits not just one line of dialogue though its a line that resonates with jon throughout the rest of the books but instead of taking what was a great conversation in the novel they have to change it to talk about jamie killing the last king to me thats something that could have been expressed later and let the scene between jon and tyrion play out as it was meant to beand you can argue over what the definition of friend is but the fact is jon and tyrion are friends and it was tyrion who largely helped prepare jon for the nights watch i would like to see that relationship unfold better than it has beenwhat fans want differs a lot if they can get george happy thats a bigger sign of that they have succeeded than that any individual fan including me likes or dislikes it not least since george knows more than most fans about adapting things to tv and again whats not necessary to you can be that to others weve obviously not seen eye to eye on the exact importance of various lines from the book why people differ in that is not easy to understand we can only accept that its so some people want the show to be like a photography of the original others want it to be like a stylized paintingand dont forget that dd are big fans of the books themselves even impressing george with their knowledge about the series they probably know the story just as well as you or i if not betteri doubt dd are that big of fans because if they were they wouldnt be leaving so much of this stuff out of their adaptation lolseriously the show is good anyone can see that but its not as good as the book so far i think grrm is happy because they are doing a great job of staying faithful to his show this isnt a true blood thing where the show takes a radically different story from the books so i can see him being happy that theyre faithful to the source materialbut to me the little things they leave out that are important in the books rob the viewers whove never read the books from a much deeper experience that doesnt mean the shows bad or theyre doing a poor job with the show it just means theyre not doing as well as they could bethere are lots of things to take into consideration when making a script no doubt a good deal that i dont even know about but for your exact example cutting 1015 seconds of tyrion walking to his family and instead inserting a talking scene with detailed information is the kind of thing that would make the show seemed more rushed than it already is and an entire scene that just lasts 10 seconds will make it look jerkymy example was about trimming little things that arent important to make room for stuff that is more important did i like the fact that they got tyrions whole breakfast order right from the book sure do but if i had to choose between keeping in him ordering breakfast and hearing arya tell joffrey she didnt hurt you much guess which one i would pickthats my point why leave in trivial stuff taken directly from the books and leave out awesome stuff that is iconic to the books makes no sensebut now you are just talking about giving information and thats what i stated by saying keeping to the spirit of the original what i said is not something thats good to do is to rip all scenes exactly from the book with the same dialog because books and tv does not play by the same rules and some scenes or information is best told in different ways in the two mediumsyou can still communicate important stuff without it coming across as boring the wolves are a big part of the series so i dont look upon them leaving out all those little details from the books as a good thing we havent seen grey wind shaggydog or a grown up ghost and have no frame of reference about how the stark children interact with them it just would be nice to see the work put in early to set that up so they dont have to backtrack later when things really get movingi know what you mean but as someone that hasnt adapted any books for screenplays i still think youve given several examples that would press an already rushed episode over the limit where it becomes clumsy storytelling some things are also done from that you are set in that information must be told in the same order as in the book instead of waiting to see if they chose to spread it out differently in the showif i were adapting  get rid of the cerciecatelyn and jonjamie scenes use that time to fill in some important backstory boom done you could easily get the information that was given in those two scenes in other ways later onwe dont have to have all the information given to us in the same order as the book but this early in the show i feel its important to set this stuff up for new viewers unfamiliar to the storyand lost is a bad comparison because that was written directly for tv and the details could be created exactly for that medium got does not have less intricate details id say the contrary given how much they hint to the books without being obvious about it and lost definitely is far more shallow than the asoiaf book series despite having an average of 20 episodes per season ive of course only seen two episodes of got but this far i think its better than lost was when it startedim not comparing the show to lost im saying the way lost layered in subtle things and easter eggs for the fans is what this show needs you cant really compare the two shows but you can say that one thing lost did right was dropping in small things that rabid fans could latch on to thats what im saying the producers could be doing with this showother than that i disagree with things that tyrion isnt saying enough to jon as i think he seems to say more in the show than in the book given the previews i havent disagreed on that things are left out ive just said that i dont think all those things are as crucial to the plot as you think plus that i have explained a different way to look at it in order to more easily enjoy it its not easy to change your views but its still worth discussing in my opinionyour opinion is always welcome bastard lol but i can still disagree with iti believe that these things while not crucial to the plot serve to elevate the story in such a way that when they are left out the story is weaker for it if the producers could find a way to keep these things in the show they would be making a far finer television series than they already areand from another postin the show we see him laughing with robb when they teach bran how to shoot a bow hes talking to arya bran robb and benjen and hes not angry at any of them and so on i agree with the other poster that they are portraying him well and your description of all he does in the show is obviously wrongthe only time weve seen jon laughing was in that first scene with bran and rob he showed no emotion in the scene with the direwolves his drunken soloparty during the feast with ghost was left out showing him angrily beating a training dummy instead acting all emo with tyrion and when he has to get his hair cut zero interaction with ghost all mopey and defensive with jamie lannister all sad with bran and catelyn the scene with arya was good as was the scene with rob but then we get emo jon with ned and mopey jon on the road with tyrion againim not saying jon doesnt have issues im just saying im not liking the way hes being portrayed so far this will change i know but jon wasnt nearly as emo and mopey as this in the books"
"The_Halfhand",2011-04-26,"i can only think you completely skipped his great farewell scenes with arya and robbi didnt those scenes were pretty much taken directly from the book as they played out all the other scenes where there were major changes really alter his character"
"The_Halfhand",2011-04-26,"the dreams obviously werent shown in the second episode because there simply wasnt the rhythm for them having bran wake up the instant lady is killed conveys much the same message that the dreams did that there is something off something supernatural something very very important going on and that bran is in touch with it and they can include dreams at other points to emphasize brans role in things to come conversations he will have in the future likely with osha and luwyn will only reinforce that those who think omg they didnt show the threeeyed crow while bran was in a coma storyline ruined are severely lacking in imagination imothis is true they could push the dream back a bit because they wanted more symbolism with the killing of lady and the awakening of branthe point of this thread though is to highlight what was left out from the books and in the timeline of this episode brans dream was left out that doesnt mean they cant revisit it later and have everything make sense it just means that along with numerous other things were different between the book and the show"
"Sprckt99",2011-04-27,"oh my goodnessthis week there seems to be a lot of effort put into defending ones opinion pointbypoint rather than a dialog discussing what was left out what was added etc as has been stated several times in several postseach person has their own opinion id really rather just hear an opinion and a response rather than going through page after page of linebyline novellas about why one person is right and the other is wrong sorry if im coming across as a little harsh but i didnt enjoy reading this weeks posts as for the first two episodes im also of the opinion that several important lines could have easily been included but we dont know what happened during the creative process im still extremely happy to see all of these wonderful characters brought to life in this series and am looking forward to the rest of the season ill get off my soapbox now rolleyes2gif classbbcemoticon altrolleyes "
"aeu",2011-04-27,"people will wish for the things they like im wishing they kept in the iconic stuff and the important stuff i admire that you are passionate about the books but i think the passion is clouding your judgement who decides what is iconic or what is important unless we are talking about lines like things i do for love there is no consensus on such things half the posters here think it should have been you is important while the other half does not some including me actually think it is a weak line and are happy that it was cut if i was writing the episode it would have been the first thing to go on the other hand i would have kept other things like the conversation between ned and bran in the opening chapter i think that is extremely important in establishing neds character stark values and the contrast between ned and robert right off the bat having read the responses to the first episode though i am probably in the minority here only a couple of people mentioned that they missed this scene so clearly it wasnt that important to many peoplein the end dd will keep things which they deem important the fact that these do not coincide 100 with what you deem important does not mean that they are wrong edited by aeu 27 april 2011  1234 am"
"Bloody Ryder",2011-04-27,"everyone talks about the it should have been you line which honestly i would have preferred to be in there as well on its own the line does not sound all that exciting or original but it works in the scene especially in light of the following scene where jon assures rob that catelyn had been very kind i think this only makes sense or packs all the intended effect when you get it should have been you before that however another line which no one seems to miss but which i think is a nice little instance of catelyn voicing her suspicions of the lannisters is when maester luwin tells c that she will want to know what the royal visit cost the starks and c then replies in the following way i know what it cost us this is better than her finding a hair up in the broken tower a needless redundancy btw as the dagger is sufficient to point towards the lannisters also i miss the wolves or rather their presence to my mind the strong symbiotic relationship of the children and their wolves is not made palpable to audiences bran waking up when sansas lady is killed is a good way to go but apart from that the manwolf bond is not all that strongly realized all in all i would say that e02s worst scenes are the queens visit to brans sickroom and what is now referred to as csi winterfell apart from those two the episode was all aces as far as im concerned  of course some dialogue deletions but still powerful although what i sorely missed was at the end when ned killed lady in the book this is followed by ned instructing one of his men jory to bring the body back to winterfell where she is to be buried because she is of the north"

consensus on whats important youre wishing they kept in things that are important to you and then you try to put your opinions as some form of law when you present them as whats important and iconicand what people get or dont get is individual ive shown the first two episodes to a few nonreaders and they didnt have any problems following itman if you want to go that route there are a lot of scenes that could have taken place in the book but were never shown i personally feel that if grrm had wanted scenes like that in the book he would have written them in therenow that doesnt mean im

can tell a lot of things in ways that are impossible to do in the show at least without becoming cheesy plus that the books have a different perspective due to the povs were told a lot about how jaime is in peoples thoughts but as important and powerful of a man as he is hes hardly actually featured at all that doesnt work with the more neutral vantage point of the show and again its not at all about what martin wants to have in the book this is about telling the general story on tvexplaining the wolves is fine but not in any way important they are showing the intelligence and supernatural things in a more subtle way and nonreaders are getting it showing rather than telling is a big thing when you adapt to tvfilmwhy would an attempted jailbreak be ridiculous that actually happens in the bookall in all its a bit funny that you go on about how much they leave out unnecessarily when george himself has said that theyve managed to be very faithful that puts it in perspective for me even when i disregard my ownyoure correct but my issue comes with the fact that the scenes that make the most sense and would have the most impact with that information available have pretty much already

ive said you can enjoy the show thats fine but im pointing out what was left out from the books and why it would have been better had they found a way to add that stuff ini disagree and i feel that you are in general way too locked into that the book is perfect and any deviation automatically becomes lesser to some degree thats of course a valid opinion to have as you think what you think as always the point of my arguments is what makes for an enjoyable situation while watching the showthe book makes most things clear through thought and you cant do that well on tv and theres usually some obvious exposition in series with large casts aryas phrases work for how clumsy a child is with these sort of things in my viewtheres a lot more than youve pointed out that could have been good in the show but there will always have to be compromises the point is that the current thing seems to work as nonreaders are getting it perhaps not all but a smart show wont be gotten by all anyway and it also goes for the books and im certainly understanding every detail thats not even explained if i for example go by what ive seen from the next episode and someone doesnt understand why jon and tyrion forms some form of bond as weve discussed i wont be shy of calling them a bit slowits not just one line of dialogue though its a line that resonates with jon throughout the rest of the books but instead of taking what was a great conversation in the novel they have to change it to talk about jamie killing the last king to me thats something that could have been expressed later and let the

prepare jon for the nights watch i would like to see that relationship unfold better than it has beenthats your opinion and thats fine as long as you see it for what it is on this board theres been several people complaining about that the kingslayer bit hasnt been exposed enough yet while they have no complaints about the jontyrion relationship its subjective personally i think what theyve done works well nitpicking about which lines were used is uninteresting to me as long as it workswhat i did was primarily disagreeing with the use of great friends not friendsi doubt dd are that big of fans because if they were they wouldnt be leaving so much of this stuff out of their adaptation lolseriously the show is good anyone can see that but its not as good as the book so far i think grrm is happy because they are doing a great job of staying faithful to his show this isnt a true blood thing where the show takes a radically different story from the books so i can see him being happy that

mean the shows bad or theyre doing a poor job with the show it just means theyre not doing as well as they could beyou can doubt it if you want but they still are i dont see people that arent big fans impressing george with knowledge about the seriesthe show will never be as good as the book even if they have 20 episodes per season and a lotr budget tv can never reach the depth that books can and these books are definitely good enough to travel in the depths that are beyond tv what tv does is making interesting things much more accessibleif new viewers want a deeper experience tell them to read the book i dont think some minor changes here and there will affect the depth significantly every fan would do the show a bit differentmy example was about trimming little things that arent important to make room for stuff that is more important did i like the fact that they got tyrions whole breakfast order right from the book sure do but if i had to choose between keeping in him ordering breakfast and hearing arya tell joffrey she didnt hurt you much guess which one i would pickthats my point why leave in trivial stuff taken directly from the books and leave out awesome stuff that is iconic to the books makes no sensei can guess but i personally think you would make the cheesier choiceits not hard to make sense of the line makes arya seem like an action movie character i think many viewers would laugh in that tense scene rather than just letting their emotions show through acting and making it seem like arya isnt too relaxed to hurt the prince they could easily have gotten the line in if they wanted but they obviously wanted the tension instead if you dont think so thats natural but theres a world of difference between disagreeing and not being able to make sense of ityou can still communicate important stuff without it coming across as boring the wolves are a big part of the series so i dont look upon them leaving out all those little details from the books as a good thing we havent seen grey wind shaggydog or a grown up ghost and have no frame of reference about how the stark children interact with them it just would be nice to see the work put in early to set that up so they dont have to backtrack later when things really get movingthe wolves will probably be explained as the story goes for example together with how bran is developing theres plenty of more important scenes than the wolves howling for bran weve even seen a few with how summer killed the assassin to immediately check on bran or how summer grows worried as lady is about to die and that act makes bran wake up every nonreader ive heard talk about that thinks that theres some strange bond between the wolves and to bran and that they seem strangely intelligent and awareas for why we havent seen that much of the wolves its because they had trouble making the dogs do what they were supposed to even simple scenes with dogs took many retakes and lots of time we did see a grown up ghost though when they were travelling to the wall just a brief shot but hes thereif i were adapting  get rid of the cerciecatelyn and jonjamie scenes use that time to fill in some important backstory boom done you could easily get the information that was given in those two scenes in other ways later onwe dont have to have all the information given to us in the same order as the book but this early in the show i feel its important to set this stuff up for new viewers unfamiliar to the storythat could probably work but youd have less developed lannister twins and as said they are much more in focus in the show because we dont just see them from enemy povs i think both jaime and cersei become two of the best written characters in the series when we get them explained here theyll go by that right away different but not less good in my opinionthe jon and jaime scene does say quite a lot it tells us what the nights watch were about what people down south think of them now clearly not elite and that jon will be swearing an oath for life jaime talking about the oath also gives the interesting perspective of that he too is sworn for life and that he just as jon swore the oath when he was young and blinded by honor and glory hes almost giving jon advice just as tyrion but jaime does it in a mocking and sarcastic way because thats how it isthe scene was clearly written very well by someone that really understands jaime on a deeper level rather than hacks that just copy things form the bookim not comparing the show to lost im saying the way lost layered in subtle things and easter eggs for the fans is what this show needs you cant really compare the two shows but you can say that one thing lost did right was dropping in small things that rabid fans could latch on to thats what im saying the producers could be doing with this showive seen several things in just two episodes that only readers understand so i dont get why you say it needs that the howling is one thing as it takes a reader to know exactly why they are howling while a nonreader probably dont even care whyyour opinion is always welcome bastard lol but i can still disagree with iti believe that these things while not crucial to the plot serve to elevate the story in such a way that when they are left out the story is weaker for it if the producers could find a way to keep these things in the show they would be making a far finer television series than they already areof course you can disagree the entire reason we are discussing is because we dont see things the same waypersonally i think the show must be pretty bad in order to make small changes that could make it far finer i think theyve made it work way over my expectations and im not evaluating how well it works for nonreaders because they seem to get more than readers think they do in generalthe only time weve seen jon laughing was in that first scene with bran and rob he showed no emotion in the scene with the direwolves his drunken soloparty during the feast with ghost was left out showing him angrily beating a training dummy instead acting all emo with tyrion and when he has to get his hair cut zero interaction with ghost all mopey and defensive with jamie lannister all sad with bran and catelyn the scene with arya was good as was the scene with rob but then we get emo jon with ned and mopey jon on the road with tyrion againim not saying jon doesnt have issues im just saying im not liking the way hes being portrayed so far this will change i know but jon wasnt nearly as emo and mopey as this in the booksyou clearly said he he only did a few things and i proved that he did in fact do more like laugh for example now youre just arguing like you wrote something else in the first placeand as for this i feel like the other poster that jon is portrayed well compared to the book edited by tywins bastard 27 april 2011  1036 am"

"The_Halfhand",2011-04-29,"yes they are all accounted for but i still find it strange to guard a woman second wife of the kings son or not when the king is at war but then again aerys wasnt called the mad king for nothingas for the marriage its not impossible they were wed but im quite sure it would have had to be a secret marriage as i cant imagine that aerys would allow rhaegar to marry a stark they searched far and wide to find him a valyrian wife but the search failed so he married elia martell due to the very slight amount of targaryen blood lyanna had none and would definitely be unworthychances are all 6 kingsguard road with rhaegar but he ordered his three best to stay back and defend his love and child should the battle turn against him the kingsguard is at the command of the royal family after all so even if they disagreed theyd have followed his ordersim sure the marriage was probably secret since robert was convinced rhaegar had kidnapped and raped her my guess is lyanna was absent with rhaegar while aerys went off the deep end and had her father and brother killed most likely they were at the tower of joy getting it on lol"
"The_Halfhand",2011-04-29,"theres also something about the faith having nixed the polygamy in the years since aegon the conqueror im not sure who the last targaryen was who had multiple wives but i dont think it was necessarily permissible in recent memory what however doesnt make much sense is that rhaegar married outside the targaryen line dany remarks at one point that viserys would have been her husband had the rebellion never happened but that doesnt really make much sense because rhaegar was the crown prince its doubtful that the targaryen family would have allowed rhaegar to marry outside the family thus diluting the blood of the dragons with baser stock and yet arrange for a more traditional marriage of the second son to dany who would stand to inherit nothing thus making a traditional union pointless even upon rhaegars death with an heir baby aegon already born to rhaegar and eliawell the king doesnt need the faiths permission to do anything though it is important to have their support since so many people follow them im pretty sure that king aerys married a nontargaryan but i might be mistaken from what i understood they intermarried as much as possible to keep the bloodline pure my guess is rhaegar fell in love with lyanna and simply married her based on that and though king aerys may not have approved he did not react well to the uproar it caused from the other lords more than he cared about the match heck he may not have even known the two were marriedviserys may have been wed to danny had the rebellion not happened then again she might have been wed to rheagars heir since she would have been of an age with him"
"Derfel Cadarn",2011-04-29,"well the king doesnt need the faiths permission to do anything though it is important to have their support since so many people follow them im pretty sure that king aerys married a nontargaryan but i might be mistaken from what i understood they intermarried as much as possible to keep the bloodline pure my guess is rhaegar fell in love with lyanna and simply married her based on that and though king aerys may not have approved he did not react well to the uproar it caused from the other lords more than he cared about the match heck he may not have even known the two were marriedviserys may have been wed to danny had the rebellion not happened then again she might have been wed to rheagars heir since she would have been of an age with himaerys was married to his sister rhaella"
"Radio Changes",2011-05-01,"im so bummed sean bean wont be a bigger part of the series the scene when the hound another great performance by the way is walking his horse with the butchers boy draped over the back and ned says you ran him down the pain and horror in seans voice anchored the whole episode you could really feel his frustration and confusion in that one sentence absolutely brillianti gotta agree with this best moment of the episode the mood of the shot itself if great dark with only some torches lighting it and the hound posture and attitude struck me as absolutely perfect even though it was just him standing up straight the dead look of his face was great sansas casting is great the girl can be wideeyed innocent bitchy and sympathetic all at once lena headey is also great i wont be able to picture cersei as someone other than her now when i reread i dont like the changes to catelyn but i can see why they made them i think theyre trying to play up the emotional aspects of catelyn and downplaying her political saavy but really when you think about it the most unsaavy move in the entire book was catelyn kidnapping tyrion so who knows but i still think they should have had her urge ned to go down there"
"lyvyathan",2011-10-17,"overall i thought episode 2 was much better than the first one but still some changes really had me scratching my head1 it should have been youagain a great line that really nails the relationship between two characters completely disregarded for no good reasonactually imho no i disagree with you that was a very powerful line but in the context of the television medium it would have framed catelyn in the worse light as possible and marked a big reference point on her way downwards  it would also have given a very dark shade of color to whatever actions she would do from then onwards2 tyrion waking up in the kennelwould have liked to have seen him in the library so the whole why do you read so much line had more merrit but this change wasnt that bad overalli thought that was good too  because it brought humor and drama ie joffreys hilarious comment about tyrions bed mates  and then tyrion slapping the dude3 queen cercei going to see branthis was an odd scene to me yes it fleshes out cerceis character a bit but the notion that she ever would allow herself to birth a child of roberts is a complete left turn from the character as shes written in the books in the books she was so full of hate for robert she aborted the only child he ever impregnated her with an odd decision though i see why they did iti thought this was ok too  because it made her seem more shrewd  shes winning brownie points from the stark family by her visit remember tyrions admonition to joff in the book shes one hell of a caricature rather one dimensional there4 lack of direwolves in particular ghostseriously ghost is kinda important and yet hes nowhere to be seen you didnt even see him travelling with jon is he just gonna magically show up soon and no sight of grey wind or shaggydog or the fact bran hasnt named summer yet sighyeah i missed the howling i agree with you here but he does make an appearance when the footpad shows upthe rest of the changes didnt bother me too much i would have been really upset if they had catelyn kill the footpad all by herself unlike the scene in the books though"
"lyvyathan",2011-10-17,"i dont like the changes to catelyn but i can see why they made them i think theyre trying to play up the emotional aspects of catelyn and downplaying her political saavy but really when you think about it the most unsaavy move in the entire book was catelyn kidnapping tyrion so who knows but i still think they should have had her urge ned to go down there ah catelyn had political saavy i thought the hbo series made catelyn more sympathetic actually"
"lyvyathan",2011-10-17,"ok in the book its made pretty clear that there is a direct link between the dagger and the lannisters when catelyn wakes up after her fourday sleep following the attack on brans life ser roderik cassell tells her that the blade was too fine a weapon for such a man and that a weapon like that had no business being in the hands of such as him he goes on to say that someone had given it to him this news prompts catelyn to divulge some information of her own she tells roderik luwin theon and rob that she has received a letter from her sister lysa who believes that jon arryn was murdered by the lannisters this immediately puts the blame squarely in the lannister camp even before this revelation catelyn mused that the man had to be one of the kings men  or one of the lannisters since robert is a friend to the starks it would automatically follow that the lannisters are more likely to be involved in the assassination attempt now with the knowledge of the daggers great value catelyn comes to the following realization it comes to me that jamie did not join the hunt the day bran fell  i do not think bran fell from the tower i think he was thrown since jamie being the queens brother is a lannister rich and prominent enough to own a distinctive dagger such as the one used by the assassin it is only logical that catelyn would make him her prime suspect for having caused her sons fall from the tower after all on the day of the crime jamie was present at the scene the motive is as yet unknown it is only said that bran must have heard something that was not meant for his ears but jamie has no alibi for the time of the fallroderik is shocked by lady starks accusation this is a monstrous suggestion  even the kingslayer would flinch at the murder of a child yet he also makes the connection between the attempted murder and jamie lannistercatelyns only response is that there is no limit to lannister pride and ambitionat this point in the narrative her suspicions are based solely on conjecture and various deductions she makes but of course there is no hard evidence to nail jamie lannister to the wall still i think it is made pretty clear why the lannisters jamie in particular could be involved not only in the murder of jon arryn but also in the two attempts at brans lifeby making catelyn like angela langsbury the hbo writers are making her a lot more sympathetic to us and her fate more tragic  ie it wasnt just lfs word that convinced her spiraling towards her new profession of kidnap and jailbreaking so i thought it was actually a good rewrite  it balances it out a bit and doesnt make it so obvious that cat has one screw loose edited by lyvyathan 17 october 2011  0108 am"
"navahgar",2011-04-25,"im not entirely sure what counts as spoiler for the tv or whether there will be book spoilers in this post but i wanted to be on the safe side if youre worried about book spoilers do not read ahead i made this post to discuss the possible hints at jons parentage in the tv episode i noticed two potential hints that jons father might actually be benjen first when ned and jon are talking on the road right before jon goes off north with benjen jon asks ned about his mother ned says that jon may not have his name but he does have his blood after this line the camera cuts to benjen riding in the distance i took that as a potential subtle hint that jon could be benjens son then later when jon and tyrion are talking about the vagaries of jons new nights watch brothers tyrion says something like the thing about the nights watch is you leave one family to join another yet again at this point the camera cuts to benjen i took this as another potential hint that jon could be benjens son personally im strongly in the r  l  j camp however i definitely think that the director was trying to suggest that benjen was jons father maybe that was to throw off the viewership but maybe he has some hint of the truth from grrm im not sure whether anyone has suggested this potential heritage from the books in that regard in the book i specifically remember benjen telling jon to father a few bastards of his own before he joined the nights watch was that a suggestion that benjen had fathered a bastard thoughts"
"Bronn Stone",2011-04-25,"the tv benjen is old enough for that red herring to be credible not so much the benjen in the novels he would have to have been quite the child prodigy"
"TerraPrime",2011-04-25,"possible but not plausible imo if benjen had been snows father theres no reason not to claim him unless he fathered jon after he had joined the nw which presents its own set of problem because if benjen made ned foster his afterthenw bastard child ned would know that benjen is an oathbreaker and we know how ned gets with that sort of business coughicecough so far we havent received any clues to help resolve this conundrum but we cant outright discard it my own hypothesis is that dd are trying to throw us off the trail ninjagif classbbcemoticon altninja "
"TheEvilKing",2011-04-25,"sounds like a red herring to me if benjen was jons dad why would ned get all teary when talking about jons mother incredible acting by sean bean by the way that to me indicates that jons mum is dead is wylla dead i cant remember"
"fionwe1987",2011-04-26,"first when ned and jon are talking on the road right before jon goes off north with benjen jon asks ned about his mother ned says that jon may not have his name but he does have his blood after this line the camera cuts to benjen riding in the distance i took that as a potential subtle hint that jon could be benjens son this shot of benjen is followed by jons question of his mother though it might also be a subtle hint that benjen knows who jons mother isalso theres another thing that has some relevance to jons parentage when cat is talking to ned before he leaves she says he left with robert 17 years ago and returned with another womans son the wording itself is fairly significant i think but to add to that ned closes his eyes at that point and i read that as either grief or guilt this doesnt point to lynanna being jons mother but it certainly seems to suggest that maybe ned isnt the father"
"smegma",2011-04-26,"im thrilled with how d  d has portrayed the mystery  and even that quick shot at benjen may be there to help confuse the rabid fans and throw us into hysteria frankly im so thoroughly convinced of r  lj that if its anything else i may just throw my arms in the air and proclaim that grrm changed it cause too many people figured it out not that he would do that but anyway really love the handling of jons parentage thus far enough to not be locked into anything when they do an about face but not so obscure that mindful new viewers may understand that theres more to the story than a simple common girl"
"KyleLitke",2011-04-26,"benjen pretty much cant be the father short of some really bizarre happenings involving the mother coming to winterfell during the war then leaving remember benjen was at winterfell the entirety of the war there must always be a stark at winterfell with ned off fighting the war and rickard and brandon dead benjen was there for the entire time evilking we dont know about wylla but we do know she was alive well after jons birth and edric dayne never implies shes dead"
"Derfel Cadarn",2011-04-26,"wont be a mystery for much longer as ned will tell jon all about it when he returns from the south spoiler oh wait"
"MattTaz",2011-04-26,"ill have to add to the above comment that im 999 convinced lyanna is jons mother i was convinced before now the tv series has basically confirmed it for me who from a tv series point of view would have the biggest impact rl has no equal have to say how touched i was by sean beans acting when he makes the promise to tell jon who is mother was that was brilliant edited by matttaz 26 april 2011  0424 am"
"Holymoly",2011-04-26,"the benjen im your father luke theory is quite attractive as i always thought the idea of eddard fathering a bastard more of less exactly the same age as his eldest son was somewhat implausible given his high moral fiber and respect for his wife im perfectly prepared to believe that ned did this to protect his own brother from retribution given his oath to the black brotherhood it also explains benjens repeated attentions given to jon when he arrives from the wall for roberts feast of course this could go either way in the remaining books"

"Xanrn",2011-04-26,"yeah because rlj is not corny cliche filled crap pie enough without adding marriage if rhaeger planned to marry lyanna why the hell did he start a war over it if he wanted to marry lyanna all he has to do is walk up to lord rickard stark and say i want to marry your daughter he didnt he kidnapped her why because targayens dont have multiple goddam wives aegon the conquerer did 300 years ago and was more than likely married to both his sisters before he converted to the seven conversion to the seven  no polygamy stop acting like one 300 year old blip is some kind of precedent for rhaeger having 2 wives aegon was the only king to have two wives and his children fought over the throne and so the targayens never did it again if rhaeger wanted to marry lyanna he would have done so instead he made it look like he kidnapped her and started a war anyway lyanna couldnt marry with her guardiansher father then either aerys or ned permission so any marriage is illegal as to why the 3 kingsguard were at the toj jeez i dont know maybe because they were sent to find rhaeger and he refused to leave unless they stayed a potential 4th in line for the throne doesnt not warrant more kingsguard than the king heir heirs heir heirs wife heirs daughter kings wifepregnant one at that kings second son thoose last 2 were on dragonstone with no kingsguard rhaeger was with lyanna in a tower in the middle of nowhere because thats what you do with secret mistresses not wives so in conclusion rhaeger didnt act like he thought marriage was an option probably because the red viper would be at the head of line with an oddily green spear didnt act like they were married and it wouldnt have been a legal marriage if they had see tyriontysha jon is a stark just like rand althor is an althor jon has proven time and time again he is a stark through and through for four books and continues do so in adwd if you want to argue semantics dd guessed jons mother correctly not his parentage so therefore either nlj or naj or nwj is the true answer my personnel theory is jon is asharas son it goes something like this war starts  ashara rides north to meet ned 23 months into the war somewhere in the riverlands tells ned where rl are one night of passion with ned  rides south again stays with elia a few months before leaving due to pregnancy rides to starfall  9 months later ned attacks the toj rides to starfall with rl babymaybe  ashara says suprise then they hatch a plan swap babies ashara takes the blackfire child and goes to braavos to become one of thoose high class whores the veiled lady ned takes the snow north being vague about jon parentage to draw any fire north towards him instead of at ashara there is something going on between house stark and house dayne house dayne supports neds wyalla story obiviously know the truth about toj and apparantly havent told prince doranor anyone and lord dayne liked ned so much he named his son and heir after him bit of an odd thing to do after ned killed arthur and ashara killed herself as for jons parentage in the tv series something might have changed season 5 or more before viewers get the answer seems suspect when given how cancel happy america tv is if you look at the walking dead tv series and comic series most of the big comic shocks are missing from the tv"

"Geriant",2011-04-26,"im mostly convinced that the rlj theory is correct but i can see some alternatives to the accepted version of the toj sequence that can throw a monkey wrench into the theory and that can support naj as well or even arthur daynelj perhaps first lyanna might not be there willingly after all in the dream sequence ned hears her screaming his name as the fight begins if she was there willingly it stands to reason she might have tried to intervene in the fight before it happened it is entirely possible rhaegar has the kingsguard there to keep lyanna from escapingbeing rescued because he believes he needs her child for his prophecy to be fulfilled and we do have at least a couple of characters talking about lyanna being raped by rhaegar after all remember while the kingsguard do guard the king and the heirs they are also under the command of the king and his heirs we also have the precedent of heirs not being guarded by the kingsguard ie joffreys bodyguard is the hound who does not become a kingsguard until after he becomes king entirely possible either rhaegar or aerys ordered the three to keep lyanna prisoner there for a number of reasons while most characters seem to view rhaegar favorably we also know that he will change at the drop of a hat if he is under the belief he needs to do something to fulfill a prophecydestiny as he was bookish until he read something that made him decide he must become a warrior whats to say he didnt hold lyanna against her will after she refused him due to her betrothal to robert after all first and foremost she is a stark and the starks always seem to do their duty when push comes to shove not just ned rhaegar likely would not have accepted that as an option if he saw her as the woman who would bear the third head of the dragon thus kidnapping her which also seems to be the accepted version of events by most in the books and further neds trip to starfall after the battle might have been to heal and recover as well as to deliver dawn while nothing ned dreamsremembers speaks to him being injured in the fight considering that everyone but him and howland reed died it also stands to reason that he and the crannogman did not come through unscathed as i said in another post sean beans ned has scars on his chest and i wonder if they are from the battle at the toj if he went to starfall to also recover from his wounds he might have been there the requisite time to have a fling with ashara dayne it could also explain why he only slipped the one time with his vows and feels such shame over it he clearly had a thing for ashara dayne but also clearly loves catelyn entirely possible while being weakened from wounds and grief over his sister after all he now had no family other than benjen he found comfort in asharas arms  perhaps even while somewhat delirious from milk of the poppy once he came to his senses ashara was pregant after the child was born he tells her he cannot be with her as he is married to catelyn i can even see ned trying to do the right thing by her in taking the child even being somewhat insistant in that ned way but ashara being heartbroken at losing ned and perhaps her child throws herself into the sea or lyanna is being held hostageprisoner in the tower of joy by rhaegar while he tries to get her with child but then he rides off to war leaving the three kingsguard behind to keep the woman he thinks he needs to bear the third head of the dragon there for him to return to and lyanna and arthur dayne fall for each other we know dayne was a fine example of knighthood and while he was rhaegars best friend it is possible like ned does about robert he finds his best friends behaviour to be less than honorable upon occasion and feels sympathy for lyanna who is also spoken of as one of the great beauties of her day eventually falling in love and getting her preggers after the fight and giving birth to jon lyanna is dying she has ned promise to take the child and dawn back to starfall while also making sure he takes her home like lady she is of the north and belongs there little far fetched perhaps especially the second scenario but i think quite plausible"

"Linda",2011-04-25,"hi ondine and welcome to the forum it sounds like youre keeping up well so far and its understandable if the dothraki are harder to get into their storyline is pretty separate from the rest and has perhaps suffered the most from the compression needed for the tv show that said they will get more developed as the season progresses drogo isnt quite a king though hes a khal a leader of one particular tribe khalasar among the dothraki they are warlike and fight both amongst themselves and when they raid neighbouring cultures but we will see later on what it is they are up to right now"
"Rand",2011-04-25,"the story is very interesting so far and the only part of it that i find a bit disappointing is the dothraki one they are supposed to be warriors if i understand well but so far they only appear to be savages and very clicha ones drogo is supposed to be a king right and yet the only thing i<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen him do in these 2 eps is have sex with dany some of you seemed a little upset by the sex scenes i think that most of them are ok but the drogodany sex scenes do seem somewhat gratuitous because i really don<U+0080><U+0099>t care if they are doing it doggystyle or missionary or if she<U+0080><U+0099>s on top and i don<U+0080><U+0099>t see how it is important to the story maybe that<U+0080><U+0099>s explained in the book but it seems to me that there are more interesting things they could put in an one hour show and they could have made better wigs for dany and her brother they look sooo unnaturalyeah this is one area that the tv show so far hasnt really made it clear while you say dany and her brothers wigs look unnatural to someone whos read the books they dont look unnatural enough and theyre missing the unnatural eyes while most of the book is grounded in realism danys lineage is one thing that is not if you recall the scene with catelyn in the woods as she huddles with her advisers and son she remarks that the dagger is made of valyrian steel with a dragon bone hilt this is what dany and visery are descendants of valyria in the series lore the people of valyria were able to raise and tame dragons as well as make awesome weapons it hasnt been mentioned yet but neds big ass sword that he used at the beheading is a valyrian blade conquered  enslaved other nations at will until some disaster fell upon them and wiped out their nation the only survivors was a family living at a remote outpost in westeros the targaryens all this info is available on hbos spoilerfree viewers guide found here edited by rand 25 april 2011  1251 pm"
"SergioCQH",2011-04-25,"the dothraki are a more cohesive group of people in the books with more phenotypic homogeneity and a more coherent fashion sense the tv dothraki suffer from the productions inability to find enough phenotypically similar extras so they had to make do with enough swarthy looking people also the costume designer has gotten a significant amount of flak on fansites for the hodgepodge nature of the dothrakis look also the reason you do not see drogo do anything but have sex with dany is because the story is being told through her eyes and at this point in the story this is the extent of her interactions with her husband the view of drogo the dothraki and daenerys will widen as she assimilates into the culture and their relationship evolves"

"Loras",2011-04-25,"let me start off by saying this i am not a dany hater nor am i particularly a dany lover after episode 2 the kingsroad dany has completed her first mini arc of the season she has progressed from being horrified and terrified by drogo and his kalasar to taking initiative and a more active role in how her experience with them shall progress i have the added benefit of watching the series with my partner who has not read the books so part of this post will be his input it must be said that so far i have been very impressed with emilia clarke in her portrayal of dany particularly in the first episode she seemed to capture the timid little girl who has been somewhat bullied and molested by her brother and sold out to a savage horselord the second episode shows us two very different sides of dany a sulky teenager who wants something else to eat but horse and a sultry khaleesi with an aim to please the husband that she is so terrified of independently i like all of these images of dany but in the context of the tv series they dont make sense unless we are expected to believe that looking at her dragon eggs while drogo has his way with her gives her the inner strength to take control of the situation as readers of the books gifted with an insightful monologue into how dany is feeling and what she is thinking we know that this is her motive but for those who havent the evolution of the character seems a little stilted and unlike the character we see in the first episode at this point we dont know that the targaryens have any sort of affinity with dragons  despite viserys jarring quip of you dont want to wake the dragon from the first episode and dany getting inner strength from the over exploited dragon eggs we are even led to believe that dany the targaryen who knows all about waking the dragon does not know that dragons are extinct my partner turned to me at one point and said that girl is obsessed with those bloody eggs i get it already swiftly followed by lets do a drinking game  every time those eggs appear on screen lets do a shot isnt the point of chekhovs gun that we know they are there but they dont come into play until later if they are forced on me much more im going to start hoping that dd make a departure from the books and let viserys kill dany by hitting her on the head with one thats a departure from my original point but i think its important none the less anyway so dany decides to take control over her sex life with a man that she sees as a dangerous savage doreah adds at the end of the scene where she is teaching dany the lyseni version of the kama sutraby saying if he wanted the dothraki way he wouldnt have married her while doreah did not understand the real reason for the marriage certainly gold from illyrio this line was presented in a way that made it seem like dany was chosen by drogo  rather than the fact that he would have married whoever had the largest dowry my biggest gripe about the way that the show has present dany so far is that we seem to have lost a transitional step while we are meant to believe that she has evolved throughout this second episode it remains implausible to methat she would have developed any autonomy as khaleesi surely she would be more terrified of drogo than she was on her wedding night i dont think it is a surprise that the rest of the dothraki were presented in a more sympathetic light in this episode note the children laughing and playing i wonder how you all feel about the evolution of dany in these first two episodes is it for you as it is for me the weakest link of an otherwise stellar opening id love to read your comments"
"CryFenril",2011-04-25,"i agree that the dragontargaryan link has so far been weakly described at best though i am assuming that this will be rectified down the road even having illyrio mention that the secret toasts are follwed by dragon banners would have helped but i dont think thats the big problem here for me for me dany is doing everything right as much as can be expected with the time constraints my problem lies with the halffinished look and feel of the entire eastern arc of the story particularly the halfhearted portrayal of the dothraki as a people plus we have seen drogo several times but the only word he has been given to speak that we could understand is still no we hear translated dothraki first from dany odd"
"NW Deserter",2011-04-25,"i always thought that danys arc was the weakest of all of them throughout the first three books so i might be a bit biased that said i think the show has captured her transition fairly well as well as her fixation on the eggs the biggest hindrance to her development is the lack of context for nonreaders like you brought up theres really no mention of her house having any relation to dragons so for the uninitiated it probably seems like she just has a strange curiosity about them"
"Social Justice Bass",2011-04-25,"surely she would be more terrified of drogo than she was on her wedding nightits hard to say i reread the dany chapters from the book and most of her fear on the wedding night is dread and anticipation about what khal drogo will do to her once they actually have to have sex he turns out to be surprisingly gentle"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-04-25,"its hard to say i reread the dany chapters from the book and most of her fear on the wedding night is dread and anticipation about what khal drogo will do to her once they actually have to have sex he turns out to be surprisingly gentlethats only on the wedding night though the book describes that shes constantly sore after being taken by drogo every night after that and just as in the show it doesnt get better until she takes a stand and does it as she wantsas to the first post it might be a bit hard to grasp for new viewers since the targaryens havent been linked to dragons very strongly but otherwise i think the visual aspect of showing the eggs with her works well and its not more blunt than doing something that states it outright im also very glad i dont have to watch the show with people that have sarcastic remarks on things like that as i would be really annoyed a worse failure as a viewer than anything the show itself as failed with"
"BlackStoneCA",2011-04-25,"i always thought the pacing in the first book was a bit forced and she went from unwilling bride to active and willing wife too swift part of the issue i think is the lack of a time line or sense of passage on time especially on the tv months can go by in the blink of an eye on tv but to our mind it looks like only a few seconds or minutes to us look at how far the grasslands are from pentos and they had been on the trail long enough for dany to grow a bit petulant at having only dried horse meat to eat at least a month or two had passed since their events in episode 1 a lot happen in a month and in the books a lot of that was inner monologue i think the series does the best that it can given that and i thought the bit with the eggs was not overdone there has to be hooks for nonreaders to latch onto since they never really hear what is going on in these characters heads much of the start of got is that inner monologue i think in the book we are beyond that where dialog and action starting coming to the forefront"
"Bronn Stone",2011-04-25,"plus we have seen drogo several times but the only word he has been given to speak that we could understand is still no we hear translated dothraki first from dany oddunless illyrio or ser jorah is present to translate dothraki makes no sense to daenerys right now she and we will learn but her memorizing a phrase to soothe her khal was perfect without that shed have never gotten drogo on his back"
"tybeechris",2011-04-25,"within the time constraints the lannisters and starks have been able to nail their family relationships i think nonreaders will now know to expect the unexpected and not be surprised by the cruelty dany however needs some more serious character development khal seems more like a klingon than a leader and no one is going to believe a little sex kitten all of a sudden becoming a major power player unless they fill in some details on the whole though a real treat and it can only help the sale of the books and maybe just maybe spur grrm to finish just a teeny bit quicker"
"Isabella Stark",2011-04-25,"thats a departure from my original point but i think its important none the less anyway so dany decides to take control over her sex life with a man that she sees as a dangerous savage doreah adds at the end of the scene where she is teaching dany the lyseni version of the kama sutraby saying if he wanted the dothraki way he wouldnt have married her while doreah did not understand the real reason for the marriage certainly gold from illyrio this line was presented in a way that made it seem like dany was chosen by drogo  rather than the fact that he would have married whoever had the largest dowry im rereading got now although i dont recall the books ever going into drogos reasons for marrying dany and im not seeing any such discussion in my current rereading my understanding has always been that dany was chosen by drogo"
"Upjumped",2011-04-25,"the dany storyline was never my favorite in the books now after seeing two episodes of the show i feel exactly the same way  i find it boring and ridiculous part of this is due to the way the books themselves are constructed but watching dany go from painful degrading sex to empowered sexy sex does not really make for a compelling narrative when you are not privy to her inner thoughts i feel genuinely bad for emilia clark for having to make her acting debut under these circumstances the dothraki scenes were one of my main concerns before the show began and i have seen nothing so far to ease those concerns and i sincerely love the rest of the show i can only hope that in the coming weeks things improve on the dothraki front once we get into the conflicts with viserys etc etc"
"The Brandon Stark",2011-04-25,"honestly i dont think i liked dany in the books until she hatched some dragons the last chapter her chapters were always good despite her not because of her like with other characters tyrion jon arya drogo crowning viserys the house of the undying arstan belwas brown ben plumm dario characters all are memorable but not because of dany so watching on tv drogo is done right so is viserys im happy with itbrbryes the undying and arstan and crew are from later books and again it was what kept me reading her chapters instead of scanning thembr edited by tywins golden deuce 25 april 2011  0404 pm"

"WinterDreams",2011-04-25,"i noticed that some of the people who commented on this page had complaints about the spedup development of danys character i have to say that this problem of time passing either too quickly or that is is not clear when or how much time has passed between scenes is something that i have noticed in other hbo productions like rome for example personally dany is one of my favourite characters in the book although i try not to pick favourites too much and i have to say that i was afraid they were going to butcher her character but i think that for the most part and keeping with the reality that it is a tv show and things are not going to be exactly mirroring the books then i feel rather pleased with emilia clarkes portrayal of her what i liked in particular was how she really comes off almost dolllike in the first episode she clearly is very hesitant and childlike underneath her brother but as this episode went on i began to see the emergence of an actual personality which really made her sections of the episode that much better"
"Yvone",2011-04-25,"i havent read the books so as someone new to the story heres my take on it i understood from what was shown that theres significance to the dragons eggs for dany although i dont understand what it is about them that have made them fascinating to her i didnt really see her drawing strength from them initially i merely thought that they provided a focus for her something else to think about than the situation she finds herself in married to a foreign brute and stranger as he is to her at the beginning and having to endure sex before she started to learn how to enjoy it isnt the point of chekhovs gun that we know they are there but they dont come into play until later if they are forced on me much more im going to start hoping that dd make a departure from the books and let viserys kill dany by hitting her on the head with onethis may be because you already know the story im not sure that id have taken much notice of the dragons eggs if they were only shown as a wedding gift as theyve been featured so far im guessing their introduction will bear significant meaning at a later stage if they keep on highlighting them in future episodes to the point of irritation ill probably lose interest but for now and also from what you say i take it these eggs wont be something to ignore in the future just like chekhovs gun while doreah did not understand the real reason for the marriage certainly gold from illyrio this line was presented in a way that made it seem like dany was chosen by drogo  rather than the fact that he would have married whoever had the largest dowryi have no trouble believing that the dowry was the reason for drogo to marry her since it was decided before he even set eyes on her and for that reason the dowry was how he initially chose her for now i also have no trouble believing that he wouldnt have gone through with it if he didnt like what he saw of her physical appearance his appearance on horseback at their house seemed to have the main purpose of checking out his bridetobe my biggest gripe about the way that the show has present dany so far is that we seem to have lost a transitional step while we are meant to believe that she has evolved throughout this second episode it remains implausible to methat she would have developed any autonomy as khaleesi surely she would be more terrified of drogo than she was on her wedding nighti admired her attempt to take some control and took it as development of her character or at least a way of getting to know her character better she doesnt seem to be one to remain miserable if she can help it and she obviously has strength of character to try to change things in choosing to do what she could to make the khal happy instead of letting him use her forevermore it looks to me like she discovered that she could have some enjoyment too"

"Asha<U+0097>Not Yara!",2011-04-26,"thats precisely why it bothers me  we have seen no translations up to this point and we have seen nothing of her learning the language to have her suddenly pop up with a perfect dothraki phrase without any detail as to how she learned it was a bit jarring for me obviously readers will know that one of her maids has been bought specifically to teach her the language but in the series nada so far drogo has been simply an object to react to for dany and not really a character in and of himself i hope this changes soonin the first episode we see dany being given her maids on her wedding and i could have sworn they mentioned one of them teaching her the language in the first episode but even if they didnt is it really that hard of a stretch for people to make itd be odd for dany not to be learning the language of the peoples shes married into and i think itd make sense for doreah to have specifically coached dany on how to say that phrase knowing shed need to explain to drogo what she was doing"
"Loras",2011-04-26,"for me dany is doing everything right as much as can be expected with the time constraints my problem lies with the halffinished look and feel of the entire eastern arc of the story particularly the halfhearted portrayal of the dothraki as a peoplei thought that some of the nuance in the second episode was lost on clarke which i found disappointing especially after how well she came across in the first episode it makes me very concerned that clarke may not have developed well enough as an actor to carry a storyline on her own yet especially not when she isnt acting with the more seasoned performers such as glen or momoa but you are right this is only exacerbated by the simplistic and unnecessarily flat portrayal of the dothraki i think glens line about ghost grass conquering the world was meant to add depth to the tribe but dany clearly rubbished that in her head i keep speaking about nuance but there is definitely nothing to add any depth to the dothraki look for example at cats effigy to the seven or comments like lord tyrion needs extra candles  these are background moments that add tremendous depth to the winterfell storyline but in the dothraki sea there is no such nuancei always thought the pacing in the first book was a bit forced and she went from unwilling bride to active and willing wife too swift part of the issue i think is the lack of a time line or sense of passage on time especially on the tv months can go by in the blink of an eye on tv but to our mind it looks like only a few seconds or minutes to usyes the pacing of the episode has definitely compounded the issue but that being said dany looks extremely unhappy in the first scene  a logical evolution from where we left her in the previous episode what i dont understand in terms of the show and not the book is why the audience is expected to believe that this girl would act out of character to try and take control of her life i think that this is a pretty major oversightthat being said we have constant referrals to how much time has passed cerseis  weve been travelling for a month or cats ive prayed for a month im assuming of course that danys tv timeline is in sync with the other charactersi think the series does the best that it can given that and i thought the bit with the eggs was not overdone there has to be hooks for nonreaders to latch onto since they never really hear what is going on in these characters headsgranted but there is a fine difference between giving the viewers hooks and insulting their intelligence which is how i feel about the eggs i understand that they are the key prop in danys story as i referred to them before they are her chekhovs gun but we do know that she has them they are pretty and everyone knows that they are going to hatch without any exposition on why dragons are important the eggs are too much and definitely not something damy should be summoning inner strength fromi think im generally unimpressed by the dothraki people the lack of explanation behind the evolution of a key relationship and all this talk of dragons without any explanation as to their significance"
"Xenophon",2011-04-26,"thats precisely why it bothers me  we have seen no translations up to this point and we have seen nothing of her learning the language to have her suddenly pop up with a perfect dothraki phrase without any detail as to how she learned it was a bit jarring for me obviously readers will know that one of her maids has been bought specifically to teach her the language but in the series nada didnt bother me and i didnt really remember when she learns the language in the books weve hardly seen anything of her interactions with the other dothraki but its seems like shes been there a while so its not really surprising that shes picking up some of the languageim agree with the op that those bloody eggs showed up a lot in the episode without any explanation but again it didnt bother me it just felt a touch heavyhanded as if the director was afraid you were checking your email the first time he showed them"
"Forgiven",2011-04-26,"well well i cant really unread the book in my mind and think of the things that way for me its been quite fine so far yet i have said this somewhere else and while its too late to change anything i really wish they had not cast dany and dothraki at all for this season or even next few they are after all rather isolated by all mean keep referring them in conversations while in westeros then throw in maybe a tv movie about how targyerens lost their power and make a spinoff show of one whole season about what happened to daenerys before merging the storylines for season 3 or 4 or even 5 of the main series would have cut the amount of introduced characters nicely which i still find biggest potential problem for new viewers and allowed for more time to go into details of both sides surely theres enough material in the books for that shame no one realized to ask me about this"
"Balefont",2011-04-26,"plus we have seen drogo several times but the only word he has been given to speak that we could understand is still no we hear translated dothraki first from dany oddbut dont forget the eastern arc is only from danys pov so it makes perfect sense that we as viewers dont get to understand whats being said in dothraki before dany caneta regarding pacing also dont forget danys first postwedding chapter contains a bit of flashbackrecap as to whats been happening with her while traveling with the khalessar to vaes dothrak again it makes sense that we dont get all the steps in between from the wedding to the girl who takes charge of her situation its actually following the book edited by balefont 26 april 2011  0748 pm"
"Balefont",2011-04-26,"i think drogo was curious about dany  as an exotic exile  curious enough to consider wedding her i think had dany not been able to hold his eye upon that first meeting looking down acting cowed and frightened the khal may not have agree to marrying her just my opinion i think the khal knew hed need a girl with the right kind of spirit"
"aeu",2011-04-26,"dany however needs some more serious character development khal seems more like a klingon than a leader and no one is going to believe a little sex kitten all of a sudden becoming a major power player unless they fill in some details when you say all of a sudden do you mean by the end of season 3forget about being a major power player dany doesnt even become a leader until the end of agot she starts learning to be a good leader in acok there is more than enough time for her character developmentthats precisely why it bothers me  we have seen no translations up to this point and we have seen nothing of her learning the language to have her suddenly pop up with a perfect dothraki phrase without any detail as to how she learned it was a bit jarring for me obviously readers will know that one of her maids has been bought specifically to teach her the language but in the series nada hanges sooni had no idea that one of her maids was bought for that purpose i might have known it once upon a time though i definitely do not remember at this point even after you mentioned itwhen i was watching the series i was pretty amused when dany said those words in dorthaki to me it was clear that she learned the specific phrase from someone it made me go well done danny that was pretty smart of you edited by aeu 26 april 2011  1144 pm"
"Winterbane",2011-04-27,"let me start off by saying this i am not a dany hater nor am i particularly a dany loverafter episode 2 the kingsroad dany has completed her first mini arc of the season she has progressed from being horrified and terrified by drogo and his kalasar to taking initiative and a more active role in how her experience with them shall progress i have the added benefit of watching the series with my partner who has not read the books so part of this post will be his inputit must be said that so far i have been very impressed with emilia clarke in her portrayal of dany particularly in the first episode she seemed to capture the timid little girl who has been somewhat bullied and molested by her brother and sold out to a savage horselord the second episode shows us two very different sides of dany a sulky teenager who wants something else to eat but horse and a sultry khaleesi with an aim to please the husband that she is so terrified of independently i like all of these images of dany but in the context of the tv series they dont make senseunless we are expected to believe that looking at her dragon eggs while drogo has his way with her gives her the inner strength to take control of the situation as readers of the books gifted with an insightful monologue into how dany is feeling and what she is thinking we know that this is her motive but for those who havent the evolution of the character seems a little stilted and unlike the character we see in the first episode at this point we dont know that the targaryens have any sort of affinity with dragons  despite viserys jarring quip of you dont want to wake the dragon from the first episode and dany getting inner strength from the over exploited dragon eggs we are even led to believe that dany the targaryen who knows all about waking the dragon does not know that dragons are extinctmy partner turned to me at one point and said that girl is obsessed with those bloody eggs i get it already swiftly followed by lets do a drinking game  every time those eggs appear on screen lets do a shot isnt the point of chekhovs gun that we know they are there but they dont come into play until later if they are forced on me much more im going to start hoping that dd make a departure from the books and let viserys kill dany by hitting her on the head with onethats a departure from my original point but i think its important none the less anyway so dany decides to take control over her sex life with a man that she sees as a dangerous savage doreah adds at the end of the scene where she is teaching dany the lyseni version of the kama sutraby saying if he wanted the dothraki way he wouldnt have married her while doreah did not understand the real reason for the marriage certainly gold from illyrio this line was presented in a way that made it seem like dany was chosen by drogo  rather than the fact that he would have married whoever had the largest dowry my biggest gripe about the way that the show has present dany so far is that we seem to have lost a transitional step while we are meant to believe that she has evolved throughout this second episode it remains implausible to methat she would have developed any autonomy as khaleesi surely she would be more terrified of drogo than she was on her wedding nighti dont think it is a surprise that the rest of the dothraki were presented in a more sympathetic light in this episode note the children laughing and playingi wonder how you all feel about the evolution of dany in these first two episodes is it for you as it is for me the weakest link of an otherwise stellar opening id love to read your commentsi dont disagree that this is the weakest part of the show well the prologue was worse by far or with the majority of your points but i have a minor quibble i think it is you who are misreading drogo immensely if you think he took dany because of a big dowry i thought doreahs line hit the nail on the head and was more effective than any equivalent from the book overall i think this arc improved immensely from episode 1 to 2"

"Aoife",2011-04-29,"while i think thats mostly true i do think she learned some from darry and probably some from mopatis as well the darry info would probably be more westerosibiased and also probably less manipulative but i find it unlikely that either refrained from talking about dragons entirely especially with viserys references with respect to the targaryen dragons i think its unlikely that viserys has not once said if only we had still had dragons the usurper would never have won or something to that effect but then i got the impression that she really was only asking about faroff or foreign dragons ie that she was doing what antitarg would have liked to have seen meaning he and i interpreted that part differently"

"RSasoiaf",2011-05-09,"my own views on a coupple things  yes it is implicit that drogo is the one who paid for danny and not otherwise but even so in the dothraki way he didnt actually paid for her he just gave gifts to the magister for giving him the chance to marry her its a bit different and he could probably have just sacked the city and grabbed her on his wayno one would actually have the power to stop him there so that really tells how much drogo values danny from the start she is really special for him and there is no doubt about that  drogo is not the regular dothraki he is a great leader because he is strong but also he shows the traits usually displayed by great leaders he is curious about the world interested to know about stuff outside his cultureand we know he even goes as far as planning on going against a really big supersticion when he decides that enough is enough and he will cross the sea also he is trying to learn dannys language alsoand we have a few more hints that drogo is far from an ordinary man  the reason that attracts drogo to danny as some have said must be because he feels she is something really special she is the blood of the dragon heir to a really powerfull and in some ways divine house for drogo it must be really interesting to have the chance to just get to danny and make her his wife you have to remember that on the grand scale of things drogo was probably born as a minor dothraki prince or warrior but danny was born princess of the seven kingdoms and heir to the most powerfull house history teaches us how julio cesar found himself subdued by cleopatra drogo is not a cesar and danny may not be humman this is just speculation but who knowsmaybe drogo dreams his heir will finally be able to get those dragon eggs to hatchmaybe he thinks that adding some dothraki magic and blood will be the trick to create a new aegon wellthe old ladys at his capital seem to be quite willing to believe on that also and more important drogo spots sparks of dragon blood on dannys character from the start the guy has good instincts he just knows she is something big  dannys transition i didnt read like many did in the books i get more or less a different story from different hints for me it seems obvious that danny has a strong character from the start after all she does try to say no to viserys which is totally not the rulle for a girl on her world she does say she doesnt want to marry drogo but on the book we are hinted that a few people around her are trying to make her see the positive side we even see her being a bit on guard about drogos power and money she is quite allert when she goes to the mansion and notices the slaves do not wear gold collars but she also notices drogo is actually handsome and indeed a powerfull man so danny is not really so inocent to beggin with thats just what manny like to read about her but she is not she a lot more targaryen and a lot more fire and blood she doesnt find a way to just showing that from startalso because she is 13 in the books still we also have her 1st momment with silver where she once again shows her true collors and then she just gets frightened by her 1st timebut by the godsits her 1st night and she cant even speak with the guyanny 13 year old would be frightened to death by that perspective stillwe are again given hints that she may enjoy sex and she is even open to experience sex with drogoshe just needs time and the right way but then she gets tanggled with the dothraki horde and ridding all day long among stangers again this must have been a shock for a 13 girl and she tells us she was not a good ridder to start withi dont know if you guys ever tried horseridding but untillyou get it it can be really a pain in the hassliterally now had that with the usual dothraki sex style and you will undersand why the girl is complainning so much she is not really going down due to her sex life but because at the time being she is really unable to enjoy her life as it isand obviously she goes down and has doubts that she can take it and be happy like that but it is she herself who tells us that after her strenght is back not all her screams during sex are from painso be awarethe girl is willing to have sex like drogo wants she is willing to explore and enjoy once she feels her strenght back then the situation just improves as she starts to speak the language and it comes natural that she wants to improve even more and explore her sexual life a bit furtheralso looking for a way to please drogo and establish her place in the relationshipbecause she wants that place i really think manny people just read danny and miss all the tinny bits where her character shows from the begginingremember one of her 1st sentences if not the 1st in the book is she remarking that no one gives nothing for free and they must want something from herthis is wicked for a 13 year old who has been raised just with viserys she is far from 100 submissive she is actually questioning viserys view from the 1st momment we see her look carefully and you will see it there danny is fragile because she has no alternative but her character is never 100 inocentdefenseless she knows whats going around and she keeps telling us that she is the blood of the dragon that is really her main character trait from the start that she wants to be aegons heir film danny unfortunately misses all these bits where she shows some cunning or character strength she starts far more blank then book danny which is understandable also film danny lacks so far her inner strenght from being the blood of the dragon and from being aegons heir which really matters a lot to book danny due to this the film eggs just fall out of the sky as the book eggs are all danny could have dreamed about from the momment she sees those eggs she secretly hopes there is a way of hatching them her talk about dragons its her playing on her hopesshe is just looking for something to give her hope on those dreams she wants dragons in all respects bettween viserys and danny danny is the true targaryen she is trully the last dragon it was not viserys it was not aerys not even rhaegardanny is the last one"

"Myrddin",2011-04-24,"the pacing was much improved in this ep and having the wolves grow up so fast helps show the passage of time loved arya shes awesome considering everyone towers over her she still holds her own and peter just knocked one out of the ball park every word and every gesture is spot on even the way he moved tommen down the bench and teased his niece and nephew spoke volumes about his character his conversation with jon was excellent this episode was very bittersweet when you consider that most of the farewells were forever my only gripe pretty minor where the hell is ghost they shouldve powdered up a dog and let him run after jon on the road or something cat losing her memorable phrase didnt bother me too much since it was written so plainly on her face all i can say is i hope there are some extended episodes for the dvd smilegif classbbcemoticon alt  this is reminding a bit of the theatrical version of the lotr movies fantastic in everyway yet not enough time to linger on the small moments lets start a campaign for an extended edition of got cheersgif classbbcemoticon altcheers "
"Kaitscralt",2011-04-24,"great episode some nitpicking 1 it seemed more confusing for nonreaders from some lines i picked up but maybe i am wrong on that 2 it should have been you  it should have been in the episode but ill get over it 3 need more ghost 4 ilyn payne looks sort of goofy but i dont care much about ilyn payne 5 cerseis speech to catelyn about losing a child with robert was interesting was this child ever referenced in the books was it a real baratheon lost or was it a sickly incest baby 6 investigator catelyn was silly but it helps explain the situation better to the viewer i guess 7 the random knight that stands beside robert during the interrogation of sansaaryajoffrey looked almost exactly like jaime and it was confusing for a second and probably confusing to nonreaders if that was him or not my favorite parts 1 summer acting up during the death of nymeria and brans eyes opening it was a nice touch to show that he is a bit different than a normal child while skipping the dream sequence it also left a nice cliffhanger for nonreaders to wonder what is going on 2 the two direwolf attacks looked amazing very well done 3 i was not disappointed that they dropped renly from the tent scene as it was too emotional to introduce a new character well meet him in kings landing no biggie 4 starting to subtly show that jorah is attracted to daenerys well done we cant see it blatantly through her eyes offpage so i like the little things like him lifting her from her horse and the way he stares after her 5 i love how the hound looks 6 jon and tyrion were both very well acted this episode more to come as i remember and rewatch edited by kaitscralt 24 april 2011  0920 pm"

"Lord Godric",2011-04-24,"honestly the only complaint i have is the rehab of cat stark the producers decision to make her less hateful detracts from the power of the story for me but her battling the assassin to save bran would have made her a hero in the eyes of most non readers regardless im afraid the producers are falling into the trap of fearing to show the heroes as people with weaknesses i hope im wrong and they dont continue to tweak the show into bad vs goodi dont think they did make her less hateful the person who i was watching it with who hasnt read the books immediately said what a bitch after she told jon to leave and i of course told him she was more of a bitch in the book but still it came across"
"CelticCail",2011-04-24,"unless cersei was lying to catelyn but she didnt seem like it it seemed clear to me that she was lying and i thought omg what a bitch i was happy they made the point of the child being darkhaired smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "
"Mya Stone",2011-04-24,"i think so too but unless cersei is lying about the events it doesnt make sense that cersei and robert had a kid it died then she had kids with jaime and proceeded to kill all of her children with robert i did take note of the dark haired and look just like robert stuff but unless we find out later that the child didnt die she killed it i think we could have been without that as it only messes with the true eventsehit doesnt mess with anything other than cerseis maggy the frog prophecy of how many children she would have and really thats not that big of a deal imo i too believe she killed the child or at the very least indirectly caused its death by drinking pansy tea after she was pregnant"
"Greylander",2011-04-24,"whats the big deal about it should have been you given the divergence of cat  jon there is no point wasting screen time on any conflict between them other than establishing that he is a bastard and that she is not too thrilled with the fact in the books the importance of it should have been you can be made with the internal monologues but in a tv show such a dramatically spiteful line would rightly be seen as a setup for an important conflict down the line  a conflict that will never materialize the line itself would only take a few seconds but would confuse nonreaders unless considerable additional dialoguescenes were provided to frame it in the proper perspective and to what end fill in a little extra back story and character development that have no relevance on anything that follows even in the books a case can be made that the line makes little sense sure cat hates jon the bastard but what line of reasoning would lead to the conclusion that it should have been him im not saying it is impossible for a grief stricken mother to lash out in anger at the hated bastard but it is a pretty extreme expression of hate not to mention twisted justice for a character who generally seems pretty sensible and fairminded for example despite her belief in tyrions guilt she treats him rather fairly leaving out the line was the right decision for the show"
"TyrionTargaryen",2011-04-24,"oh wait one complaint where the hell was the three eyed crow dream fly i cant fly then die do you have any corn"
"The Brandon Stark",2011-04-24,"wow is all i can say this episode was near flawless every trivial difference was soooo made up for with all the actual dialog strait from the books the scene with the assassin was perfect i knew what was coming and still my heart was racing do wish ghost was in the episode only complaint he could have just been sitting by jon with tyrion after being a fan of the books for close to 15 years this show is a real payoff amazing tonight beware the snarks and grumpkins"
"Blue Steel",2011-04-24,"awesome i was expecting this episode to be weaker than the 1st due to some of the early reviews my favorite scene was robb and theon discussing possible war and maester luwin putting them in their place the robb and theon dynamic is beautifully set up its going to be tragic to watch how this arc plays out the ending was also done well and it made me feel like i felt during the book when i tell ned to take his kids and go back north someone said that they liked the actress who plays missandei but isnt that doreah"
"Kaitscralt",2011-04-24,"it also seems to me that they are downplaying some of eddards screen time during his pov chapters probably so the nonreader is not so drastically crushed when he loses his head at the end of the season"
"Jonias Snow",2011-04-24,"1 for the dagger the exchange and the wolf coming in1 for csi catelynactually cat investigating what happened to bran is a logical outcome to the assassin they all thought he fell but the attempted murder would get any intelligent lord or lady thinking so naturally she or robb would go back to the tower in medieval times it was the lord of the manor that played detective since robb is a teenager this would then fall to cat or luwin finding that hair is also very logical considering what they lann were doing so a stray strand of long hair where there should be none in a long abandoned tower the location of which is were bran fell its an easy conclusion to come too what i like about the godswood scene is how maester luwin shuts up robb and theon i smiled at that exchange"

"blasted_saber",2011-04-24,"great episode their was one wide angle scene with ghost in it his absence in other parts could be explained by him being off hunting i think their was so much screen time with nymeria summer and lady that they may have intentionally cut back ghost scenes for now"

"anne3624",2011-04-24,"i got that as wellwhy did they think she should have said something else the series is depicting caitlin as sympathetic and ceirsi as sympatheticwhy does hbo want to show them in a better lightdang"
"Bronn Stone",2011-04-24,"and the second problem was the catelyncersei scene not because they are setting cersei up to be sympathetic because i think they definitely made her unlikeable when she insisted on ladys execution but because of the whole fever took my first son thing unless cersei was lying to catelyn but she didnt seem like it we all know checks to see that this is the book spoiler thread that cersei was supposed to kill the actual children of roberts so im not sure how this fits in but really minor problems with an amazing episodeehit doesnt mess with anything other than cerseis maggy the frog prophecy of how many children she would have and really thats not that big of a deal imo i too believe she killed the child or at the very least indirectly caused its death by drinking pansy tea after she was pregnantcersei is telling the truth almost she had a child killed by tansy not pansy she did so with great gusto"
"Aganerral",2011-04-24,"5 cerseis speech to catelyn about losing a child with robert was interesting was this child ever referenced in the books was it a real baratheon lost or was it a sickly incest babyas far as i can remember cerseis only mention of the books of children with robert is her telling about how every time she did she drank the pansy tea to abort it"

"Sturn",2011-04-24,"to the no ghost comments i thought i caught a glimpse of ghost before the jontyrion scene about books are the whetstones of the mind perhaps im not recalling this correctly but when the scene starts there is a zoomedout shot of the camp in which i believe you see ghost it then zooms in to jon and tyrion speaking nothing close up of ghost that i recall perhaps they didnt want an animal taking away from this important tyrion scene"
"Balefont",2011-04-24,"i have no problem with the attempts of depicting cersei being as sympathetic theres plenty there to hate if you ask me it adds to her lack of trustworthiness but then these are all characters with several sides"

"XtremeOne1",2011-04-24,"my explanation of the ceresi and the dark haired child is that the child was her first i dont see ceresi killing her first born not even in the one from the book i loved the episode my only problem was the lack of three eyed crow"

"Kaitscralt",2011-04-24,"cutting out the it should have been you line for an eddard appearance helped with fluidity during the scene aside from that it is obvious the producers do not want the nonreader to hate catelyn and cersei both so let the line go i say"

"dmkoffler",2011-04-24,"so about the nonbook scene where cersei tells catelyn about the boy she lost clearly that was added to help humanize and soften cerseis character but it seems to me that the larger point was the detail about him having black hair  foreshadowing the reveal of joffrey tommen and myrcellas paternity and allowing them to cut down the exposition of the history of previous baratheonlannister matings from the book"
"Rockroi",2011-04-24,"another week another just toprate episode for some reason i expected a letdown this week but nothing of the sort happened in fact i think this episode free from the breakneck pace of the pilot i liked a hair better here<U+0092>s why1 the queen and her first child this is clearly the best scene in the series that was not in the books this scene was cersei doing a very good job of covering her tracks by paying her respects mothertomother which leaves a series of harsh questions most notably did cersei mean what she said its possible that cersei really does regret bran<U+0092>s fall and really does want him to recover in the hopes that he would never uetter what happened as she states unconvincingly in the books or<U+0085> its all a mirage she used real emotions to hide her true ones in the hopes that some riverland bitch and her stupid northern flock will be fooled and then this what if she made the whole thing up with this cersei<U+0085> i put nothing past her 2 the kingslayer<U+0092>s brother finally they mention that jaime slew poor old mad king aerys ii jon snow throws it into tyrion<U+0092>s face and then we see only through the lens of a really good actor like dinklidge <U+0096> just how the comment disgusts tyrion i always thought it would have been jaime<U+0092>s ire nope we see quite clearly how much this comment from a bastard no less irks tyrion and you see in his face why how dare this shit throw up jaime<U+0092>s good deed into my face just like everyone else does behind jaime<U+0092>s back<U+0094> tyrion almost looked like he had to hold himself down it<U+0092>s a subtle or not reminder of how much pride the lannister<U+0092>s have in their name and how much love tyrion has for jaime and how much other people do not get it and i liked how tyrion interacted with his niece and nephews 3 drogodany part deux first i liked how dany looked at the eggs to almost harden herself for getting fuckedraped by drogo second then the scenes where dany learns better sex and then masterfully takes control she is nobody<U+0092>s slave this turns a really harsh scene in the pilot into a redemptive moment for both characters kal drogo can be more subtle and dany can be the master 4 by the book almost every scene this week was identical to what we saw in the books whole swatches of dialog were taken in full sheets well done 5 this far no farther it<U+0092>s a great scene in the books but when the yetastobenameddirewolf <U+0093>summer<U+0094> gouges the throat of the attacker and then plops himself onto bran we see that this one has that bond with bran and by context all the wolves<U+0092> bonds with their hosts but when that direworlf plopped down next to bran all i could think wa that was not a wolf or a cgi it wasn<U+0092>t but it may soon be a cgi it was not a device or a deuxex machina etc no that was summer a full fledged character who nuzzled up o bran and said to anyone who could dare to care <U+0093>you have to get through me to get to him<U+0094> almost<U+0085> almost like he was making up for what happened at the tower 6 robert the fat and the naked lady i loved how robert was very robert all episode at the meeting with ned and thereafter and then i loved how he became smaller than a snail when cersei demanded a wolf pup and then arya and sansa and their eyes and ned seemed to choke back some tears as well finally the deed was done and somehow a scene that time will soon forget was as powerful as it ever was in the books we see how personal ned takes it how deeply innocent lady was and how cruel this age could be startling 7 i want you to leave i for one liked that cat did not say the utterly heartless <U+0093>it should have been you<U+0094> line which 1 is almost crazy and 2 makes no sense in the book it has a place we have to see how tough jon snow has had it so hard in a very short period of time well in the show they cover that and thus can change that line 8 less hound more bite in the books the hound is more emotional more severe here he is almost detached from all this especially when he slays the butchers boy his he didnt run very fast line is spoken far more matteroffactly almost like a dog doing the butchers work what i am on the fence about 1 the missing ghost of jon snow its not that i need to see this walking plot device anytime soon but more of him and the remaining direwolves would have been welcome 2 jaime and jon i have no clue why this scene was there to tell us about the wall to make jon seem brave jaime seem like an asshole like that<U+0092>s needed after last week this seemed like unnecessary filler but it has jaime in it so im not complaining my instinct is that jaime is not in the episode much at all and maybe the actors or producers wanted him in the scene to have him earn his money 3 here<U+0092>s the wall<U+0085> now go somewhere else the least they could have done would have been to give us a brief tour not liking1 the king and his court of like 4 guys i would like the show much better if we finally gt to meet renly and selmy etc those scenes work a lot better if you actually have the crown<U+0092>s court around i especially did not like that the hound got selmy<U+0092>s lines we need more depth to this breath overall the better of the two episodes where emotion rules the day"

"Ferrum Aeternum",2011-04-24,"outstanding episode  all around i enjoyed this one much more than the first although i thought it was great too every important scene was pitch perfect and relevant to moving the narrative forward thus far i have to commend dd on their approach to telling this complex story in such a compressed time frame add to that some stellar performances and excellent effects work the direwolf scenes were masterfully done  much better than i was expecting and it made for another superb hour of television my only real complaint is that the episode started off a wee bit slow i would have probably begun the episode with the tyrionjoff scene rather than the daenerysjorah bit while its getting better the pace and direction of dany scenes still seems a wee bit awkward compared to the rest of the episode content i did enjoy the interaction between dany and her handmaidens it is known made me grin reeeeeal big biggringif classbbcemoticon altd  and the performances were fine i think that part of the story just needs a bit more room to stretch its legs since there are a lot fewer action sequences on that side of the world early in the book"

"Lord Godric",2011-04-24,"i cant remember if this was dialogue from the book but the jaimetyrion scene where jaime is talking about cripples is somewhat foreshadowingit is dialogue from the book pretty much exact but excellent foreshadowing nonetheless"

"Seerow",2011-04-24,"so i havent read the whole thread yet so dont hate me if this has been covered but did anyone else not like the way the last two scenes lined up with bran waking up just as lady is killed i mean it seems innocent enough for dramatic purposes right now but consider this show from the perspective of a new viewer who never read the books here we get a dire wolf whom has some connection to the stark children dies and just as this happens one of the stark children on the edge of death wakes up now fastforward to the season finale where a major theme is a life to pay for a life and its not too hard to imagine new viewers looking back on this and thinking that lady dying is what brought bran back and possibly even extrapolating it to there being some sort of blood magic going on among the starkswolves while in the book this connection really doesnt exist that said i did like the episode i felt like it was a step up compared to the first episode overall"
"Lady Nerevar",2011-04-24,"anyone catch how cersei described her dead baby as a bird without feathers probably not intended that way but i thought it was a nice reference of sorts to the 3 eyed crow and bran not being able to fly not having feathers"

"ingsve",2011-04-24,"i know that is how the actors were saying it but i thought it was going to be dubbed over it certainly was when robert asked aryas name in the first episode and the second problem was the catelyncersei scene not because they are setting cersei up to be sympathetic because i think they definitely made her unlikeable when she insisted on ladys execution but because of the whole fever took my first son thing unless cersei was lying to catelyn but she didnt seem like it we all know checks to see that this is the book spoiler thread that cersei was supposed to kill the actual children of roberts so im not sure how this fits in i think the main reason for that scene is to mention that the kid that died looked just like robert to set up for the future that joff and the other kids dont look like robert at all"
"DragonAge93",2011-04-24,"wow so much emotion in this weeks episode i literally was almost crying at the nedjon farewell sean bean is such an amazing actor and ill piss on the emmys if he doesnt get nominated and win best actor in a drama show the saddest part was how he said when we see each other again which as all us bookreaders know will never happen i wanted to cry because i hate ned dying hes my favorite in the whole series and knowing that he wont be able to tell jon about his mother is just too sad and summer attacking the assassin scene was pure epic how summer ripped his throat out just how i imagined it when i read the book kinda gruesome but makes the show all the more realistic and the ending now i may be a guy but i did cry just how painful it looked for ned to do it and the yelp next week cant come quicker although i do hate how its on sundays because sundays are the days i usually dread due to that tomorrows monday feeling but now they are the days i look forward to the most i guess asoiaf has the power to cure sad sunday feelings"

"KyleLitke",2011-04-24,"jack is too short but that is a quibble of the least sort and he is otherwise spot on it does seem weird to me that joffrey is shorter than sansa especially since his being taller than robb was a sticking point for robb in agoti dont agree that grrm set sansa up to be hated he set her up to be a typical teenaged girl the kind that would like britney or miley or bieber or somesuch if she were alive today but she also has her virtues  her social graces her ranesque knowledge of westerosi heraldryyeah i thought i was making that same point re sansa my apologies if i didnt get it across well and yes hes short but other than that i think he nailed joffrey so im fine with a height difference it doesnt actually matter for anything anyway"

"The Sand Snake",2011-04-24,"i thought the show tonight was even better than last week it went so fast but i still felt like they got most of the important stuff in there for people who havent read the books what i liked 1 when summer saved bran that scene was the most epic scene of the two shows so far it was awesome 2 how the wall looked from the south 3 the fight with the kids theyve all been really good so far 4 the hounds line he ran not fast enough it was perfect what i didnt like 1 csi winterfell was lame the hair was blonde so it had to be the lannisters 2 cersei making up her kid never happened in the books nothing even close happened i think it will confuse people in the future that was the only thing that resally annoyed me other than that cant wait for next sunday"
"Seerow",2011-04-24,"bran did become sensitive to the other wolves in the books at one point he finds ghost and sees through his eyes he and rickon know ned is dead mostly because nymeria knows through aryai didnt make the life for a life connection it is a nice catch though unintended by the producers but id be surprised if even 100 fans who dont read this will do so as welli know bran became sensitive to the other wolves thats the whole warging thing i was more referring to the blood magic aspect of itmaybe youre right and most people wont make that connection but im trying to think from the perspective of someone who has never read the books and from that perspective we see a wolf dies a boy wakes up later on we see a witch a mindless guy and a baby die and 3 dragons wake up its a pretty big parallel and while its unintended i dont think its a stretch to say someone just watching the show wouldnt draw it on the other hand the real question is how many people watching the show have the obsessive type of personality that leads them to analyze things like that and either havent read the books before or are restraining themselves from reading the books for spoilers i doubt theres many but they may exist"

"Lord Godric",2011-04-25,"what i didnt like1 csi winterfell was lame the hair was blonde so it had to be the lannisterswell the tower was supposed to be deserted so finding any hair along with the clearing the dirt was suspicious and as catelyn said they already had means to question the lannisters loyalty to robert along with the fact that it was no accident an assassin was sent to brans room with a valyrian steel dagger i think just putting 222 together clicked for her edited by lord godric 25 april 2011  1203 am"
"Dragonfish",2011-04-25,"i really enjoyed this episode felt much less packed to the brim than the first one and like others said it was so nice to hear so many lines of dialogue taken directly from the book one thing i didnt really like though was cerseis scene with catelyn i get why they included it it establishes the robertblack hair connection among other reasons but what i dont like is that it doesnt make any sense at all that cersei would make a point of mentioning how black the childs hair was and how much he looked like robert i mean why would she risk drawing attention to the fact that her current children dont look a thing like robert"
"The Sand Snake",2011-04-25,"well the tower was supposed to be deserted so finding any hair along with the clearing the dirt was suspicious and as catelyn said they already had means to question the lannisters loyalty to robert along with the fact that it was no accident an assassin was sent to brans room with a valyrian steel dagger i think just putting 222 together clicked for herehh i guess i still dont see it i didnt like the fact that they had her find a blonde hair wasnt really needed espeically since it was cerseis hair i doubt shed think cersei threw him from a window"

"Jaimelan",2011-04-25,"whats the big deal about it should have been you given the divergence of cat  jon there is no point wasting screen time on any conflict between them other than establishing that he is a bastard and that she is not too thrilled with the fact in the books the importance of it should have been you can be made with the internal monologues but in a tv show such a dramatically spiteful line would rightly be seen as a setup for an important conflict down the line  a conflict that will never materialize the line itself would only take a few seconds but would confuse nonreaders unless considerable additional dialoguescenes were provided to frame it in the proper perspective and to what end fill in a little extra back story and character development that have no relevance on anything that followseven in the books a case can be made that the line makes little sense sure cat hates jon the bastard but what line of reasoning would lead to the conclusion that it should have been him im not saying it is impossible for a grief stricken mother to lash out in anger at the hated bastard but it is a pretty extreme expression of hate not to mention twisted justice for a character who generally seems pretty sensible and fairminded for example despite her belief in tyrions guilt she treats him rather fairlyleaving out the line was the right decision for the showhow do you know that the conflict will never materialize given starksbanes attitude towards and her idiot uncles and they are both loose  ill bet anything you want a confrontation is coming"

"Josiah Rowe",2011-04-25,"i thought that episode was great with terrific pacing and powerful yet subtle performances from the leads though like everybody else i was surprised by cerseis conversation with catelyn i think it worked and will work with the narrative points to come my only adaptation quibble was that joffrey wasnt present for the conversation in which its suggested that a swift death for bran might be considered a mercy surely spoiler that makes it more difficult to conclude as is suggested in the books that the somewhat hamfisted assassination attempt on bran was his idea i didnt make the life for a life connection it is a nice catch though unintended by the producers but id be surprised if even 100 fans who dont read this will do so as wellfor what little its worth i thought of it right away before reading this thread so you just need to find 98 more"

"Phantomwriter05",2011-04-25,"i liked the episode  but i have a theory about the cersei story on one hand its most likely that she did have one of roberts babies judging from where lena is coming from with the character but i also have a feeling that cersei pulled a medea from jason and the golden fleece myth she was pregnant and she saw that robert was screwing around so in her hatred and anger she other had the child killed and or killed it herself so those tears could be guilt for murdering her own child and than she feels possibly more guilt for taking part in another killing of a child"

"RemitMan",2011-04-25,"one of the strongest scenes of this episode was cersei<U+0092>s visit to catelyn and bran cersei speaks of her blackhaired child that died but never mentions his name she tells how this baby looked just like the king the addition of this scene is perfect and necessary to the rest of the story not only does it set up later revelations but also confirms how coldhearted cersei really is the mystery that eddard investigates is given one more clue with this scene more at httpasoiafovrnitthroness01e02"

"kn32",2011-04-25,"i hate to say it but i agree this episode felt so awkward and forced i had the same overall impression as you which was that the story is not at all suited for tv the performances and overall dialogue here felt lackluster compared to the first episode the sex scenes made me cringe it almost felt comical to be honest i think it has more to do with the performances and the madefortv look which brings me to my next point this episode really felt madefortv whereas the first one had the look of movie i dunno im just kinda baffled here i absolutely loved almost everything about the first episode the performances the dialogue everything was just about pitch perfect i got the complete opposite impression here maybe the story just comes off better in the book it all seems rather silly on screencouldnt agree more i actually came into the series with low expectations and grew to have very high hopes after the first episode this is a story that is too expensive for tv and far too long for movies its painfully obvious how much the budget holds the show back with the dothraki scenes when i read about the horde of khal drogo its like something out of braveheart or return of the king in the show however it just looks like dany is out camping with the cleanest savages youll ever hope to find one of which appears at random to rape her excitingi dont fault hbo for this it wouldve been impossible for them to do the dothraki right the only part that i do not understand is how clean they all look they sleep on the ground every night after riding their horses all day the majority of them would only be able to bathe in rivers when they get to bathe at all yet even the slaves look as if they just got out of a beauty salon bugger the others the most notable sign of magic in this show so far is the hair  makeup of danys servants"

"Kat",2011-04-25,"my general reactionsi can see why mo ryan ranked this as the weakest episode i think a lot of important stuff happened but it also had the feeling of being very transitional because the characters were doing a lot of traveling which gave it the feeling of the endless travel scenes in lotr without the helicopter shots and with more interesting character drama i didnt think it was bad but i found the scenes with jon going to the wall particularly had that were going somewhere interesting but are not quite there yet feel to themmark addy is awesome i love him as robert i have flashes of robert baratheon is a terrible king already hes just on the edge of being competent like when he says the whole thing is just kid stuff and then goes and doesnt want to bother actually fairly dealing with the direwolves and then his picnic with ned interspersing paranoia with reminiscences about the good ol days of rolling around in the hay with random girls i love it makes a great pathetic echo of formerly fun best friend for nedi actually liked catelyn and cerseis scene together if cersei were obviously mean and untrustworthy and unsympathetic there would be no reason for ned to trust her as he stupidly does and for catelyn to give ned permission to take the girls to kings landing or for sansa to trust her the audience should be going oh hells no every time she speaks but only because were the only ones who know how twofaced she is and for that to be realistic she cant be a cackling villainessthe thing i felt was missing was any sense that joffrey cared what his father or anyone else thought of him if he doesnt seem to crave the respect of robert why send the assassin after bran at all i know this isnt revealed until much later but in whats revealed in that episode the writers dont give any credence to the actual killer of bran who seems at most to be indifferent and hates over the course of the episode tyrion and arya much more on the flip side lots of notsosubtle clues left about other thingsno idea why people really think the writers need to be heavyhanded about making the audience hate catelyn isnt the whole appeal of this show that most of the characters especially the pov characters have shades of grey so why the apparent need of some people for the writers to make some characters even more unlikeable than they unintentionally came off in the original text i guess haters gonna hate but for those of us who dont spend all our reading time seething over catelyns every action wellwhy purposefully turn the audience against a character that would be uncharacteristic of the writers and producers and the opposite intention of a show written with no clear villains"

"Loras",2011-04-25,"i might get slated for saying this but there was far too much dany with very little development in this episode having read the book i know how danydrogo should be portrayed  but i love the way that they have been portrayed by the series thats why it made little sense to me that dany would decide to try and please the husband who has been treating her so cruelly also my first disappointment with clarke comes in the first sex scene where she notices the eggs and gets a jokeresque grin on her face there has been no reference in the series so far that the targaryen sigil is a dragon or that the targaryen kings even had dragons its an oversight that i think we are making because we all know the history of the house i missed viserys this week although i did enjoy his little scene with jorah helped to tie jorah in to the sprawling map of characters that we have so far iain glen is going to be brilliant in this role as someone else mentioned the slowbuild of his attraction to dany is going to have a much better payoff down the line negatives aside i adored the opening family lannister scenes dinklage seems to have settled into the role nicely and he really came across well the budding relationship between jon and tyrion was also well developed that scene really added to both of the characters as well as firmly establishing jons arc for the season bravo to both actors involved heady has done a brilliant job of developing cersei she was a real standout in the trial scene though props must go to williams for making me love a character that i hate from the books the scene between cat and cersei was also very powerful it was nice to see cersei let her guard down the assassin scene might be my favourite scene from the show so far it had such distinctly creepy undertones and i felt the pain in fairleys palms as she clutched the dagger for me the overexposure of dany drags the episode down 2 points but everything else was nearly perfect now that the story lines have all been firmly established i am hoping to see some strong character development over the next few weeks before the action amps up 710"

"WaitingforWylla",2011-04-25,"glad they cut brans dream as that would likely be too strange to see i wonder if theyll have him talk about it though also loved how they connected bran and the wolvesim assuming that there will have to be several discussions about 3eyed crow dreams some time in the future  in the meantime they are doing a good job of connecting bran to the wolf i am a little concerned about the lack of neds dreams and memories thoughalthough most of what comes up in his head relates to mysteries that havent been clearly resolved in the books up to affc so they are likely saving themselves from too many unanswered questions later as the tv show stil seems unlikely to make it that far"
"legba11",2011-04-25,"i think the jaime and jon scene did a few things 1 it gave jaime more depth its clear the writers are looking at the lannister twins as the deeper characters they will become as opposed to the generic muhahahaha villains they are at this point in the books he is concerned that his brother who he loves and is not able to defend himself in jaimes eyes is about to go to a dangerous place i think he began the conversation as helping to ensure tyrion will be safe he establishes jons ability and tries to improve the lannisters standing in jons mind 2 however jaime is a somewhat stupid prick and his nature somewhat blows it anyway even when hes trying to do the right thing he screws it up 3 jaime is nearly nonexistent in this episode we all know him and are used to characters going away for hundreds of pages the tv audience dont know the characters yet you cant have a wajor one disappear in ep2 why not use him for some exposition"
"reiver",2011-04-25,"it also would make sense that she would kill her own baby until she was sure it was jamies this is cersei were talking about herethis was the one thing that kept me from totally condemning that scene if she reveals to ned later during their godswood confrontation that she actually murdered roberts first child it will bring her more into line with the book that said the idea of her killing a newborn vs aborting a child would seem out of character one of the defining traits of cersei is love of her children and to kill onegood episode i liked it better than the first although the first 1015 minutes were a bit mehthe jorah scene about the grass although lifted from the book seemed a really weird choice to include as it felt like the sort of fluff and flavour that could naturally be cut without losing anything it seemed even stranger to focus on asshai another random name thrown in there for nonbook readers rather than to use the description of the dothraki sea to set the scene for viewers the only reason i can see for keeping it is that grrm has told them theres something that links in with it in future books viserys scene was ok and i liked the ambiguity of whether jorah thought that a king with those morals was a good thing or not i still think i prefer the way the info was relayed in the book though doreah scene was much more tasteful than i imagined from the previews and worked well generally the whole nudity was done much better annd felt less gratuitous and certainly not leering the jon and arya scene was good but lacked a bit of context after they removed them watching tommen and bran spar its hard to say whether its just my mind saying this sounds wrong when they deviate from the book lines or whether the dialogue isnt as good but the scenes where they stay most true always seem to play the best so while almost everything about the jon leaving worked even the lack of catelyns line the jaime scene seemed off to me forced and awkward was the feeling i got i like the idea of the paralleling with the kingsguard experience but i dont think it was a good scene and just felt out of place that said the ned and jon goodbye was a very good add and nicely ties in to the rlj as i feel it really emphasised ned was willing to tell the truth when jon was oathbound to take no part in the goteverything else was pretty good id have liked a wee bit more venom in cerseis line we have a wolf but on the whole it was decent drama and played out well"

"ZombieWife",2011-04-25,"jackbelucky wroteand the same scene is perfect in expressing the pressure that sansa is under when called to testify sure  when i first read that scene i was pissed that she doesnt back up aryas story but on reflection she basically does the only thing she could do in those circumstances which is abstaining from taking a side she just has too much too lose any other way its a horrible place to be and she ends up losing in the end you just have to feel some sympathy for her at that pointi agree seeing the scene played out made her far more sympathetic i thought turners delivery of lady is good nailed it for me she wasnt at all softspoken she showed that stark fire albeit a little too lateoh and i second your comment about ned walking through the crowd i thought oh boy    agreed in the books cat makes it clear that she could forgive ned the infidelity if jon was kept out of sight out of mind out of wintefell jons constant presence all these years is what prevented that emotional wound from ever really healing cat telling him that she wants him to leave came across as 16 years worth of resentment she didnt just want him to leave the room but the castlethe regionher familys life shes always wanted him to leave well donei loved cats performance with jon telling him it should have been you would not imho have translated well to the screen i could feel the hatred and loathing oozing from her sometimes what is left unsaid is far louder than what is actually spoken the creativewriting team chose perfectly on this oneon the dream sequencei admit that i was disappointed in not seeing it i wanted to see that threeeyed crow my guess is that it will be brought in later perhaps bran will remember the dream a while after he wakessad about the absence of ghost as well perhaps well see him more at the wall and beyond smegma saidby the way for those that arent aware  sophie turners sansa family adopted the dog who played lady so she has lady forever so coolgood to hear yaydoreah is so hot good castingshe is awesome oh and jon favreau actorwriterdirector tweeted that the game of thrones intro is more interesting than most tv shows lolyou just made me love favreau even more than i thought possibleone question i have for some of you what about joff i found him a tad sympathetic especially when tyrion was slapping him i felt like i needed more evil joff and more buildup for me to really get on board with hating joff furthermore when he was downed by arya and started to whimper for his life and after robert berated him for being bested by a girl i kept thinking well its no wonder he turned out the way he did hmmm not sure what i think of that edited by zombiewife 25 april 2011  1100 am"

"howland_reed",2011-04-25,"someone brought this up earlier but seeing the scene with ned and jon followed by ned and robert pretty much cements the rlj theory imo if there was ever any doubt i dont recall ned and robs conversation about dany being in the book until much later when they were all at kings landing already but even when i first read it i just figured ned was defending dany because she was just a child and he didnt want to stoop so low as being a childmurderer for the king but now seeing it so wellacted by bean and knowing the rlj theory it really drives home that ned is defending dany not because he doesnt see her as a threat to the throne which she most clearly is but rather in a sense hes defending jon you could tell that his promise to lyanna probably burns through him since hed like nothing more than to tell jon the truth but seeing how vehemently robert reacts to dany he knows he has to keep it secret"

"Seerow",2011-04-25,"see the reviewers take at 1050 about this scene i think cats harshness was readily conveyed to most viewers i know this is just one example but i think enough have picked up on iteta hes never read the books and is avoiding all spoilers and all helper information hes of the mind that he should be able to get whats needed out of the show without all the back up information overall or 99 of all this guy is quite insightful smilegif classbbcemoticon alt eta2 reg joffrey  hes a bitch joffrey rant begins at 1355lolgif classbbcemoticon altlol thanks for linking that i have him subscribed now should definitely be interesting to followi already got a kick out of how some of his perceptions are relative to what we know from the books for example in the first review we find out he thinks that robert arryn was the kings father and king before him while king robert was the previous hand he also thinks of the targaryens as just another clan and seems to think the dothraki are a southern part of the 7 kingdoms in the review you linked he refers to viserys as a smartcunning player overall its just interesting to see the impressions someone gets from the show without the books as a reference or someone familiar with the books helping them out"

"Brewmaster",2011-04-25,"my thoughts it was a better tv show than the first episode as it should be and i liked the first one a lot too with 10 minutes taken up by a prologue scene probably we are going to get a bit of a rushed feeling first episode every season the pace is quick as it has to be to get through the book but it felt a little slower this time around than last week which was good they are playing up the dragon eggs very prominently i realize that they were prominent in the book too but i think its even more clear here and earlier on that they are going to hatch nothing wrong with that just an observation it wasnt until awhile into the book until i realized the dragons were alive in there while i think id know already watching the show on the topic of sadness like others have mentioned the goodbyes were sad knowing that most are forever i felt bad for jons farewells with ned and robb particularly actually one of the saddest parts for me was just seeing sansa walking lady through before she meets payne and the hound the tv narrative gets the job done im surprised to see such angst over it should have been you bottom line is what cat said works just fine it should have been you is kind of a strange thing to say i though so on first read and it would probably be even stranger without internal monologue its already established she doesnt like him trust him or want him around i never quite got that it should have been you made any sense at that point they think he just fell while climbing why should jon have fallen while climbing when he wasnt climbing or in any danger i get itgrief stricken mother not thinking clearly hates jonetc still its just always struck me as out of place unlike others i was actually dreading that line coming because of how unnatural it seemed to me in the book i was not only ok with it being cut but i was glad to see it cut so much is taken directly from the book that its great loved seeing summer rip out the throat of the would be stabber right down to the shot of the pulse trickling blood out of his throat it was nearly a word for word shot my wife is watching the show blind having never read the books and i dont explain things to her im just watching her see it untainted by foreknowledge to see how she reacts so far the tv show seems to do the trick about the same as the book imo when cat says i want you to leave my wife sayswhat a bitch when ned is forced to sacrifice lady my wife says toabout sansa well you shouldnt have lied and your wolf would still be alive when brans eyes open at the moment lady dies my wife says whoaspooky and she enjoyed tyrions slappings of joffrey as much as any reader of the book would"

"ZombieWife",2011-04-25,"hey zombiewife if you have a bit more to say about this id really be interested to hear it to me as it seems to several viewers here it was a big loss in the episode which was i do agree better than the first what makes you think it wouldnt have been appropriate for the screen i felt that fairleys performance was so spot on in that i could read that from her wo her uttering a word that saying it would have been overwrought and a bit too melodramatic for me a parent who grieves for the potential death of a child can make them say terrible things but i think that catelyn being who she is well even in her situation griefstricken she manages to maintain some dignity i didnt need her to say it should have been you i read it in the fairleys eyes im a fan of allowing a reader or in this case a viewer to fill in the blanks of what catelyn might be thinking i dont want it all spelled out for me all the time i guess as a viewer it makes me feel like im in on some secret you know and that by making things obvious takes away some of that viewermovie connection and mystery its just a preference i know others may want it another way but i thought it was beautifully done"
"Social Justice Bass",2011-04-25,"you know what i loved the most about this episode the interactions among the lannisters the lannister children at the table tyrion sawing joffreys ass off for his stupidity and thoughtlessness tyrion making his brother and sister squirm with his questioning  the list goes on more lannister scenes please"
"ZombieWife",2011-04-25,"im not zombiewife but in my opinion the dislike cat has for jon is not really strongly built up its kept visible but relatively subtle and to suddenly jump to a point where she says something like that and to then have jon walk off and they never make anything of it again can be a bit oddi think they managed to show that cat does not truly hate jon himself she hates what he represents and that ned brought him to be raised at winterfell the line it should have been you does not go in line with that its extremely personal so the nuance they showed would perhaps have been lost since they cant spend anymore time explaining a relationship that pretty much ends right after that sceneso i would rather ask the question what positive thing would that line have brought other than to please people that like things just because they are directly from the bookthe build up was more subtle i agree but she nails it on the head when she tells ned a few seconds after jon leaves that he rode away with robert 17 years ago and a year later returned with another womans child i thought the timing was perfect i guess i think fairleys icy cold stares at jon are loud enough smilegif classbbcemoticon alt  i think shes brilliant"
"Ser_not_appearing_yet",2011-04-25,"im not sure knowing the names of the various characters is that important certainly not at this stage i remember midway through the first season of the wire i was totally hooked and there was still half a dozen characters whose names i couldnt give you i just never picked it up but the characterization was there and i still knew who the character was and their role in things etc etc if the show can do this with someone like theon until it actually becomes important to know who he is arrogant sleazy guy who hangs out with stark thats perfectly fine same with sandor barristan and others"

"Manakhkubar",2011-04-22,"oh i think you are right about the cheesy factor also the direwolves are simply going to have to be cgi at some point and that presents a lot of cheesy problems of its own my biggest fear for the season is that the last episode will be ruined with lame looking dragons during danys final chapterwell dragons are actually easier to be cgied than the wolves humans dont have movement and expression patterns of dragons deeply embedded into our brains as opposed to those of wolves dragons fly and fast and can therefore be both more distant and more blurry that of course isnt an issue in the first season the easiest move would be to go for noncgied puppets"

"Kaitscralt",2011-04-22,"all i know is that im going to need to have kleenex ready for any scenes with lady or nymeriayou mean the direwolves weve never seen i guess in the sense that any pet dying in film is usually sad since the animal has no understanding of what is going on or control of the situation it will be sad but definitely not like the book not that i mind much"
"PhoenixFlame",2011-04-22,"teehee im expecting a call from my dad about ladys death hes heard me yaking about the books for years but hasnt read them he really liked the first episode though apparently my stepmom who hasnt even heard of the books and generally dislikes fantasy thought the first episode was really good what the fuck he just gets pushed though im waiting for her reaction to brans surviving"
"Daenerys",2011-04-22,"theres a mistake in hbos description text that they send to for example tivo it says ned leaves westeros with his daughters which caused me to freak out because i hadnt read the book for a number of years i was all what the hell he left westeros where did he go to pentos or and i just couldnt possibly remember anything about him going across the ocean and of course then i realized it should read winterfell not westeros the also kind of ruin the cliffhanger at the end of ep1 brans fate remains in doubt thanks hbo edited by daenerys 22 april 2011  1127 pm"
"NW Deserter",2011-04-23,"the preview clip of dany with her handmaidens made me very happy that conversation was basically lineforline from the books from the it is known being repeated to the moon being an egg the jonjaime exchange is an interesting addition but i like it"
"Aelinor Keath",2011-04-23,"im confused i thought his hair was dark in the first episode did i get confused about who he was if i did thats rather embarrassing for someone who has read the books more than once blushinggif classbbcemoticon altblushing it looks like they changed theons hair during filming maybe the wig wasnt working or they wanted to give the viewers a subconscious clue like blond teenage guy  face punch winkgif classbbcemoticon alt "
"CryFenril",2011-04-23,"seems to me that they have jaime taking the part of tyrion in the discussion about the wall  maybe to keep ghost from becoming an issue since the pups are still so little takes a much longer scene and chops it down into a shorter one but still gets the point across  the wall is teeming with badduns and the lannisters are arrogant sobs edited by cryfenril 23 april 2011  1114 pm"

"DemiNymph",2011-04-24,"how many hours more to the show"
"CryFenril",2011-04-24,"dont think so  theres a scene weve been shown clips of with tyrion talking about the crimes jons fellow recruits have committedi think that scene is just to show jaime being a dick and maybe also to increase the starklannister rivalry a little more though i personally think a scene with jaime and robb would perhaps be more effective since jon is on his way out of politicsoh i have no doubt well see tons of jon and tyrion  i just see some of the stuff that came out between them coming out now without the need for a direwolf jumping in and protecting jon i wonder if this is engineered to make jaime more of a bad guy and tyrion more sympathetic"
"Eddard house stark",2011-04-24,"ok is it me or are the direwolfs gonna have to age real quickly to a attack joffrey b save cat and bran the first episode they are so small they would be easy as pie to dismiss"
"israfel070",2011-04-24,"i dont think shes saying it to the hound more likely to joff or sansasansa i believe she threatens her sister then ned sits her down to have the talk about the danger of kl and how the lone wolf dies but the pack survivesi always thought it was funny that he never even addressed sansas betrayal of her sister if he had straightened that out at this point he may have prevented her from turning him over to cersei in the future assuming shes even capable of loyaltybased thinking of that kind"
