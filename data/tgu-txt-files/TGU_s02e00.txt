"1" "5432Hun" 2012-04-02 " i just find none of the characters appealing and many are either so annoying i wish them dead fair enough if you dont enjoy the books its a matter of taste and all that but im pretty sure this is the point all of the characters are flawed and hard to love to some degree or other although personally i find one of the characters who does some pretty despicable things when you get down to it hard not to love or just plain boring and i have no idea why they are included or why their point of view of a certain issue is so vital if you find thm boring thats probably not the point but like i say each to their own i sometimes wonder why some of the characters are given prominance and then it turns out their story ends quickly or meanders about a bit but ive come to the conclusion there needs to some misdirection in the books otherwise it would be a bit too obvious when he pulls a rabbit out of the hat "
"2" "Bauchelain" 2012-04-02 " i cant lie the tv series is pretty great having read all the books and seen the series i have to say that this is the first time i have ever said the showmovie is better the books the first book is great and sets up what should have been an amazing story and then martin just botches the job completely i cant lie i found every book after the first one disappointing however i wont go into an indepth discussion since i dont want to give away spoilers i just find none of the characters appealing and many are either so annoying i wish them dead or just plain boring and i have no idea why they are included or why their point of view of a certain issue is so vital save your time and read a real series like the malazan books of the fallen an unreal series with such a wide assortment of characters set in a world that is twice as conniving backstabbing and ruthless as martins "
"3" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-04-01 " btw it does seem to me that so many people have read all five books that its very difficult to avoid spoilers  not of the upcoming series but of series to come i am halfway reading through book 1 but have seen series 1 i dont wish to know any more than i should in advance of any series 2 episodes my plan was to read the books after watching each series  "
"4" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-04-01 " oh i think i know what you mean flaying of more than fingers possibly no that should be response to jackston 30 march 2012 1144pm not me and i was asking for no spoilers  "
"5" "sunnyone" 2012-04-01 " 5432hunthanks for that i actually worked it out this morning and spent ten minutes reading it again i get what youre talking about but the message is awfully subtle id certainly not spotted it in my previous two readings of the books "
"6" "5432Hun" 2012-04-01 " sorry i too was thinking of something else ummm which wedding feast are we talking about here or is that in itself going to turn out to be a spoiler we cant do private messages on here can we the wedding that happens later when the colour of the brides eyes is not remaked upon by the guests "
"7" "sunnyone" 2012-04-01 " reread the wedding feast chapter again and look closely at lord manderlys actions the clues in his request for the rat cook song i missed in the first time as well sorry i too was thinking of something else ummm which wedding feast are we talking about here or is that in itself going to turn out to be a spoiler we cant do private messages on here can we "
"8" "Jackston" 2012-04-01 " o i had missed itgenius thanks btwwas wondering what manderlays game was "
"9" "pillroad" 2012-03-31 " actually no i was referring to another thing altogether although i must admit the hints that reek may have lost more skin than just his hands did also have me squirming it really is a brutal book honestly reread the wedding chapter and focus on the lord manderlay character very closely he gives hints about what he did and the pay off is both horrible and rewarding "
"10" "pillroad" 2012-03-31 " jackston 30 march 2012 1144pmresponse to pillroad 29 march 2012 936pm it also features possibly the most brutal and shocking moment of the series which is so subtley alluded to the chances are youll miss it if youre not looking closely enough now im worried i missed it really what reread the wedding feast chapter again and look closely at lord manderlys actions the clues in his request for the rat cook song i missed in the first time as well "
"11" "badger1969" 2012-03-31 " fair point having looked at tafkajamies link it was obviously just something i wasnt paying particular attention to at the time "
"12" "sunnyone" 2012-03-31 " the fact that renly is gay  which i didnt think was implied at all in the books  actually makes a future storyline far more plausible sorry badger but it was more than just implied imho  it was spelled out pretty clearly on more than one occasion and by more than one character "
"13" "sunnyone" 2012-03-31 " it also features possibly the most brutal and shocking moment of the series which is so subtley alluded to the chances are youll miss it if youre not looking closely enough im not giving anything away but i think i know what youre referring to and yes it was truly awful btw it does seem to me that so many people have read all five books that its very difficult to avoid spoilers  not of the upcoming series but of series to come "
"14" "ConorLane" 2012-03-31 " im just shocked she hasnt been snapped up for other tv roles either that or ive just missed them either way yes she is exceptionally fine "
"15" "badger1969" 2012-03-31 " oh i think i know what you mean flaying of more than fingers possibly "
"16" "badger1969" 2012-03-31 " its in the back of the dance with dragons paperback too "
"17" "badger1969" 2012-03-31 " i think there were more ironborn chapters in the 4th book  aeron damphair victarion etc that i did struggle with im more interested in asha  theon who are virtually the only ironborns in the 5th book victarion has just one chapter i think i also loved brienne in the 3rd book but found most of her story in book 4 terribly tedious part of the problem might have been that the reader knows more than the character in terms of what she is trying to achieve in the book but i also thought her chapters   some others in the book  contained an awful lot of tedious folklore stuff that seemed to have little relevance to the story the sort of stuff tolkien might have put in the silmarillion though i never managed to read it rather than clogging up his main story "
"18" "badger1969" 2012-03-31 " the fact that renly is gay  which i didnt think was implied at all in the books  actually makes a future storyline far more plausible "
"19" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-03-31 " it also features possibly the most brutal and shocking moment of the series which is so subtley alluded to the chances are youll miss it if youre not looking closely enough now im worried i missed it really what no spoilers please "
"20" "Jackston" 2012-03-30 " it also features possibly the most brutal and shocking moment of the series which is so subtley alluded to the chances are youll miss it if youre not looking closely enough now im worried i missed it really what "
"21" "gimpmask" 2012-03-30 " i concur wholeheartedly and am also looking forward to got "
"22" "TAFKAJamie" 2012-03-30 " its very difficult to respond to this absent spoilers but yes youre wrong pretty spoilery explanation as to why "
"23" "monders" 2012-03-30 " correct me if im wrong but i dont think its ever confirmed in the books that renly and loras are in fact lovers isnt this something hbo have devised themselves its not explicitly stated but imo its quite obvious my gaydar is pretty good odd skill for a brash northerner but there you go and it picked up on that juicy tidbit oooer paging dr freud "

"26" "monders" 2012-03-30 " seeing people discuss the books and potential spoilers therein has made me realise that i read them all far too fast back to back and i cant really remember too much of any one particular volume oh noes ah well back to book one page one "
"27" "monders" 2012-03-30 " just happy to help a fellow throner i know i know oh oh ohhh guardian please feel free to use this term to refer to us nerds on these her got blogs "
"28" "SmartyMcFly" 2012-03-30 " i havent read any other fantasy series that builds so much on intrigue and power rather than the personal jounrey cliches that are rife in the genre there are cliches in grrm mainly in character type but these are often then subverted  again i dont want to highlight specifics here as it will reveal character arcs you could equally say  fantasy  dwarves   tick tyrion but of course hes not your traditional bearded dwarf the one cliche that i have been a bit fearful of in the series  is the presence of dragons  in one sweep that has endangered much of the genrebending that he does elsewhere i always look on asoif as more akin to historical novels rather than fantasy "
"29" "xBarleyarleyx" 2012-03-30 " really looking forward to this although i am getting pretty tired of people saying that it is unique for a fantasy series or somehow more mature or real it reeks of people trying to somehow justify watching fantasy because they dont think it is as credible as other genres ive read a lot of fantasy novels and a song of ice and fire really doesnt do anything differently to many others the problem usually lies with how people adapt the books to the screen i could name a slew of other titles that would seem just as impressive adapted for film or television if given the same respect that game of thrones was given "
"30" "Redable" 2012-03-30 " looking forward to whos going to stitch up who  in some cases literally   dragons  dungeons this aint "
"31" "Clariana" 2012-03-30 " since eddard starks execution id say tyrion is the main character and he hardly gets two lines are we watching the same series ill refrain from speculating on the reason for this "
"32" "5432Hun" 2012-03-30 " ok let me spell it out because you are clearly something of a hodor anyone finishing book 2 will have been left in a state of suspense over whether a certain character is alive or not anyone reading your comments about certain characters talking to each other in book 3 will have had that unceratinty removed impoliteness doesnt come in to it "
"33" "Brownly" 2012-03-30 " i really hope daenerys targaryen comes into her own in this series the little bits where she was angry and powerful were brilliant for example the i am the queen of the dothraki last of the dragons etc etc etc oh yes im completely in favour of any development which gives me more opportunities to look and drool at daenerys though i tend to get distracted and forget to follow the plot when shes onscreen gods shes gorgeous "
"34" "delebimusplebs" 2012-03-30 " what ending for bsg did you want their total destruction by the cylons i thought the end was fine albeit with a little too much mystical nonsense "
"35" "Hugekebab" 2012-03-30 " a hard on is coming "
"36" "Lewelltam" 2012-03-30 " i thought that this would be an issue too but the showcreators have talked open and often recently about breaking up the later books in the series so that they come out as separate seasons should buy martin enough time the real concern is whether or not hbo would keep commit to finishing the story properly should the show start to lose ratings dont believe for a second that they wouldnt cut the show if hbo thought it was in their interest theyd cut the show like wilko johnson cut ned stark "
"37" "UncertainAgain" 2012-03-30 " im trying not be spoilerish but i dont think theres a real mapping of the wars of the roses onto a song of ice and fire its got some other strange european conflicts thrown in there as well like the war of the austrian succession and elements of the thirty years war i mean its a big world its not all starksyorks vs lannisterslancasters if you are interested at all then yes i do recommend learning some of the actual history but dont go thinking that martin spoiled the ending for you  "
"38" "franciscat" 2012-03-30 " looking forward to this at first i dismissed it as some more lotr nonsense then i watched episode 1 and was hooked anyway i am just happy that footballer own hargreaves was able to put the disappointment of a careerending injury behind him and land the part of robb stark httpstaticguimcouksysimagesfootballpixpictures20111201295548877681owenhargreaves007jpg httpstatictvfanaticcomimagesgalleryrobbstarkpicturejpg "
"39" "manoknok" 2012-03-30 " saying thatthe tv series is actually very good and highly recommendable trouble is grrm is only on book 4 5 depending on view point of 7 8 depending on view point 1 book every 7 years means there will be a 5 year gap between season 4 or 5 and season 6 or 7 "
"40" "manoknok" 2012-03-30 " oh dear i wouldnt say it is unlike any other fantasy except for nipple tweaking that is fairly unique the black company is far more unique as is eriksons and friends malazan book of the fallen albeit both a very different style i would hasten to add that personally i wouldnt recommend reading the book of grrm till he is finished whereas both of the above have finished their series he baseborn hero literally jon snow is a basetardthe exiled princess daenayrsthe noble knight eddard um do you have to be familiar with a genre in order to write about it on the guardian if not can i write in the money section i have never seen much of it mainly as it goes on sci fi and fantasy books "
"41" "SmartyMcFly" 2012-03-30 " honestly  hobb and erikson as examples of breaking fantasy cliches  i suggest you might be interested in looking up the heros journey as a template in the context of fantasy novels  it pretty well describes every one of hobbs very enjoyable  but utterly cliched books  particularly the assassins trilogy there are cliched subjects within martins work  but more often than not there are occasional exceptions they are subverted in some ways  particularly the traditional heros arc i dont want to discuss any particulars in got  for obvious reasons "
"42" "elmicker" 2012-03-29 " whereas in the book i dont recall it being quite so obviou its not explicitely referred to but in the early books the talk of renlys unconsumated marriage to margaery tyrell is supposed to be the hint and in the later books grrm goes on at some length about the knight of flowers dedication and undying love for his king they made it a lot more obvious in the series because renly had so little screen time trying to infer an affair between the two wouldve just resulted in a lot of well who on earth are renly and loras "
"43" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-03-29 " i finally got round to watching the first series a few weeks ago i know i know and i can’t wait for the 2nd one ditto had heard of got but never realised how good it actually was until i watched series 1 mind you it took a few episodes "
"44" "Nishy2012" 2012-03-29 " ive read all the books and seen none of the tv series but have to admit this so called homosexual affair between loras and renly flew right over my head for anybody out there who loves the books i recommend trying robin hobbs books also hopefully these will be filmed one day as they are the best fantasy ever bar tolkein "
"45" "Sunburst" 2012-03-29 " oh for heavens sake heres another huge giveaway  in the books characters talk to each other and sometimes theyre impolite "
"46" "TinyFemaleWriter" 2012-03-29 " note to self must read about the war of roses "
"47" "6ofclubs" 2012-03-29 " i havent read all the books yet im pretty sure the last one hasnt been released yet but i cant be the only one who wants daenerys targaryen and her dothraki hoard to rule when all is said and done am i "
"48" "DCharlie" 2012-03-29 " not at all but when every character has a british or irish accent and the majority are british or irish the american trying to do a british accent sticks out like a sore thumb and it is blatantly based on the british isles especially since the plot is basically the war of the roses with different characters "
"49" "5432Hun" 2012-03-29 " ffs  dont give away plot points "
"50" "TinyFemaleWriter" 2012-03-29 " we also got male nudity although the dickquota was one every five episodes if i remember correctly theon greyjoy and hodor a nice change from the usual womenonly nudity also some naked men without full frontal view considering the number of prostitutes and bastards affairs and incests and descriptions of sexual encounters in the books i dont find it unfitting at all "
"51" "5432Hun" 2012-03-29 " highly recommend reading the books after watching season 1the casting is perfect i thought some of the casting was spot on ned varys littlefinger theon tyrion and tywin some of it was fine catelyn robb and john  though both obviously older than their characters cersei and jaime but robert and renly were both disappointing hard to believe mark addy was ever a mighty warrior and when i read the book after seeing the series i thought they got renly completely wrong  taller darker and better looking i thought also iain glen as jorah isnt bearlike enough looking forward to stephan dillane as stannis and liam cunnigham as davos both look excellent choices "
"52" "Sunburst" 2012-03-29 " grr martin greenlighted the gay realtionship between loras and renly so i guess there was something to work with are you kidding seriously whats wrong with you people there are so many allusions throughout the first three books to renly and loras illicit relationship that i find it absolutely incredible that anyone had been surprised or shocked when it was depicted in the tv series i guess jaimes threat to loras somewhere in the third book ill shove my sword into you somewhere so deep where even renly never went actually managed to fly over some peoples heads despite being as subtle as an exploding tractor really this should be the new version of the iq test method of the test  read the ice and fire books describe the nature of the relationship between loras and renly "
"53" "Sunburst" 2012-03-29 " no loras is his lover apparently you missed the blowjob "
"54" "JonnnyA" 2012-03-29 " first book  goodsecond book  so terrible that i havent picked up any of the others so wrong  in order storm of swordsclash of kingsgame of thronesa dance with dragonsa feast for crows seasons 3  4 of the tv series should be the peak if they match the books highly recommend reading the books after watching season 1the casting is perfect "
"55" "art1st" 2012-03-29 " its totally bonkers  but im addicted "
"56" "Affirmative" 2012-03-29 " unlike some here i found book 2 to be the best in the series and am really looking forward to how they are going to bring certain events to the screen yes i thought obviously bk1 was amazing even the 1st chapter the hook caught as well as setting my expectations for a mighty fall bk2 was the pick of the lot although i personally thought 5 really shone again with the sweep and spread of the storys ripples growing ever wider all books breathtaking imo but those had certain swings in the story that are very memorable perhaps whereas i guess there might be more room for ruminating in the othersmore paths that could have been taken given the action and fallouts no bad thing i only have one tiny merest of trifles smallest of quibble in the whole lot and its too big a spoiler to discuss any further enjoyed the series thoroughly "
"57" "pillroad" 2012-03-29 " except orcs and the poor who are always cockney "
"58" "pillroad" 2012-03-29 " i think book 5 was one of the best of the bunch particularly the psychological torment of reek a character who i thought it impossible to feel sympathy for after book 2 it has a villain who is more insane and sadistic than joffrey and far less inhibited in taking his pleasures it also features possibly the most brutal and shocking moment of the series which is so subtley alluded to the chances are youll miss it if youre not looking closely enough there is a difference in the pacing of books 4 and 5 the reason for this is they occur in the relative peace that is in place after the war of the 5 kings which takes centre stage in the earlier it was martins original intention to stop after book 3 have a 5 year gap and then have book 4 pick up when all the characters were 5 years older however he figured that if he went through with this there would be too many gaps to fill this is also one of the reasons why it took him so long to write those 2 a feast for crows and a dance with dragons both tokk 5  6 years to complete im hopful that now that hes back dealing with the plotting strands he originally envisaged the next ones will be easier for him to write "
"59" "SpinningHugo" 2012-03-29 " it will be even more the dinklage show as he is the most significant character in book 2will the budget stretch to the battle of blackwaterwho will play pod "
"60" "5432Hun" 2012-03-29 " sort what accent out this is a universe created in martins head perhaps dinklages character has the correct accent and everyone elses sucks or were you under the impression the american george martin set his fantasy world in some version of britain lol   youve forgotten the universal law that all fantasy worlds are populated by people who speak like john gielgud "
"61" "5432Hun" 2012-03-29 " by the way soome may not be aware that there is a sample chapter of the next book winds of winter available to read on martins website strongly advise you do not click on this link if you have not read all of the books so far httpwwwgeorgerrmartincomifsamplehtml "
"62" "ellipsis10" 2012-03-29 " also hope the dwarf has sorted his accent out only bad thing about last season sort what accent out this is a universe created in martins head perhaps dinklages character has the correct accent and everyone elses sucks or were you under the impression the american george martin set his fantasy world in some version of britain "

"65" "NZerDan" 2012-03-29 " brilliant first series just got the dvd set after missing the last 4 episodes on the tv run it wont happen this seaon currently reading the first book and its not difficult to imagine the characters in a different way to the tv show its very well written easy to read and enjoy even for a uneducated bastard like me "
"66" "TheSub" 2012-03-29 " agreed but since the end of spartacus blood and sand i try not to get too attached to anyone since their facesarmslegsheadspenisestonguesall of the above getting lost at any point is not only very possible but extremely likely "
"67" "SmartyMcFly" 2012-03-29 " really looking forward to this bought the dvd set for s1  and i never buy dvds let alone those of tv series im a huge fan of the books and living here in ni ive been lucky enough to see some of the sets and met some of the cast at a moot in belfast before s1 aired unlike some here i found book 2 to be the best in the series and am really looking forward to how they are going to bring certain events to the screen one thing that the benihoff and weiss really deserve credit for is the way they have adapted the show sure it mainly followed the books but it does diverge in places and is set to make further changes as the series progresses to streamline things for the more constrictive medium of tv i think they have already confirmed that if storm of swords gets green lit  it will be spread over 2 series and filmed in one go the next 2 books will be a mashup  so events from a feast for crows and a dance with dragons will appear together in what i suspect will be 3 series that should leave grrm approx 4 years to get the next couple of books out i dont want to say anything specific but im looking forward to some of the more minor characters and hoping that they are brought to the tv screen in enough depth "
"68" "HonestIago" 2012-03-29 " agreed i think the relationship with renly and loras was pretty obvious in the books littlefinger taunts renly over it though not at the level of shaving and bjs but both were still presented as masculine renly isnt too bad but the knight of the flowers just isnt a twink  with most of the other characters i picture their tv portrayals when i think of them but finn jones is completely miscast "
"69" "Lime83" 2012-03-29 " i have been counting the days for about 3 months now winter is almost upon us hail "
"70" "ConorLane" 2012-03-29 " i really hope daenerys targaryen comes into her own in this series the little bits where she was angry and powerful were brilliant for example the i am the queen of the dothraki last of the dragons etc etc etcalso i really loved the little sarcastic yet oddly civilised verbal battles between littlefinger and pycelle hopefully the heavier political focus will bring us more of those  "
"71" "Agent80" 2012-03-29 " my little birds tell me this series is going to be really quite special "
"72" "Affirmative" 2012-03-29 " v well put 5432hun this series is staggering in its scale i remember reading that some people suggested tv series would eclipse films in their scope and depth still im very glad i read all the books first   i think feast of crows and dance with dragons possibly feel strange as said because of the timelines changing from purely sequential chronology and perhaps the feeling that some stories are not galloping like a bolted horse still but as explained by 5432hun linked the number of threads increases with the story progression visual image of a break using snooker balls flying in every direction "
"73" "Affirmative" 2012-03-29 " theres an interesting interview with george rr martin in which he discusses the eye color he speaks quite plainly about it i think that will answer some of your question "

"79" "deathtothepixies" 2012-03-29 " are you joking one of the reasons i love the series is because martin is not afraid to kill off important characters both good and bad guys its one of the things that sets the story apart from other fantasy series "
"80" "LonePair" 2012-03-29 " no you are running faster than me completely forgot about that scene thank you for the correction "

"84" "wotchaaa" 2012-03-29 " if you have not yet read the books i can not stress how much better they are than the absolutely amazing show i dont read much fiction and i dislike fantasy but i read all five in the space of about 3 months the extra information and clarification in the simply makes the show even better "
"85" "daboiy" 2012-03-29 " i laugh because of your joke about the actress being 40 but the truth is its a pain in the arse waiting he took 6 years to get book 5 and frankly it wasnt good i hope the wait for the next one is not as long and that the book is better "

"88" "R042" 2012-03-29 " although as i say the guys sense of story plotting is excellent  i am enjoying the tv series but i really hated it at first his plots good but i agree with others that dance with dragons loses its way if anything it dwells too heavily on viewpoints that arent that interesting and spins them out past the point of viability its the sort of place where tvs time constraints will pay dividends "
"89" "deiseach" 2012-03-29 " am i a bad guardianista for spurning the books so i can watch the mayhem unfold onscreen without without knowing whats ahead probably but seeing as im taking the murdoch soup im already beyond redemption bring it on "

"91" "Valten78" 2012-03-29 " peter dinklage really makes this show for me his portrayal of the fast talking tyrion lannister is excellent and by far and away the most interesting character arc i could easily watch him as the central character to the whole thing agreed tyrion lannister is just a brilliant character and dinklage plays him to a slimey perfection "

"93" "R042" 2012-03-29 " but such repetition is that poetic license or plain laziness the guy clearly doesnt lack imagination so why does he seem so clubfooted in expressing its fruits id say its an attempt to do clever things with style that dont quite work out see also his returning to using words that dont quite work one critic i read pointed out his overuse of the word leal in his latest book and using repeated catchphrases my names reek it rhymes with  for one  although martin still isnt quite as bad for this as joe abercrombie say one thing about joe abercrombie say he wont let a neat paragraph opener go "
"94" "MilkMe" 2012-03-29 " anyone ever noticed that whenever a dignitary in one georges books has their hair brushed it shines like spun silver andor gold does he know any other similes why does he always intimate a familys personality traits by the colour of theyre eyes i only ask because i think the guy is great at designing epicsthinking up the bigger picture but such repetition is that poetic license or plain laziness the guy clearly doesnt lack imagination so why does he seem so clubfooted in expressing its fruits "
"95" "5432Hun" 2012-03-29 " all good information thanks i am quite disappointed one of the fairly minor characters does not seem to be reappearing in season 2 wont say who hope they come back later "
"96" "TAFKAJamie" 2012-03-29 " theres a live movie option on wheel of time btw "
"97" "TAFKAJamie" 2012-03-29 " the budgets been increased for this season theres a new vfx house handling effects and they hired neil marshall  a man who knows how to do lowbudget bigscope battles  to direct the key battle episode of season 2 early reviews from the us indicate that the concerns of scale have been offset by the onetwo punch of incredible locations for shooting and more cg in crowd shots "
"98" "LV09" 2012-03-29 " msconfused  hrababble dont get me started on wheel of time the series that was so long that it managed to outlive its authorgods they were a slog some great bits but rj and brandon sanderson didnt half drag it out a memory of light is out in january 2013 thankfully its the last one theballa fair enough loras and renly may be more than just inferred in the books but im pretty sure there was no chest shaving and more scene in the books though "
"99" "TAFKAJamie" 2012-03-29 " theyre amending certain of the sequences too as some events from a storm of swords are being moved up in time to allow for characters who otherwise wouldnt have much to do to have more scenes in this season some characters were not cast for s2 google will reveal which i think rather than me dropping possible spoilers here but may yet appear in s3 the general thinking it may have already been confirmed by benioff  weiss i forget is that the next two seasons of the show  assuming renewal  will cover the events of storm "
"100" "hoover2001" 2012-03-29 " the second book has such epic battle scenes that i wonder if the budget for the show can even come close to portraying them still like last season the writing and the great actors will probably make up for anything lacking in the action department "
"101" "hrababble" 2012-03-29 " i just hope grrm doesnt die before finishing the series like robert jordan did "
"102" "MsConfused" 2012-03-29 " i am so excited about this its probably not right lol i first read the books  the ones that were out at the time  8 years ago at university along with that other fantasy epic wheel of time aka the series that will never end i devoured the books in a matter of days but never ever thought that they might be made into a tv series  and definitely not so well since the first series ive reread the first few books and have just finished the first half of dance with dragons yes i do agree that dwd is a lot more plotheavy but just as enjoyable and i still put my entire life on hold for a week to read it the second part should be with me by saturday "
"103" "5432Hun" 2012-03-29 " did i read correctly late last year that the tv show will not really follow the books after this series because they become too hard to follow adequately theres been a suggestion that they will follow the sequence of events in the story rather than adapt each book in succession because the events in the later books overlap to some extent this seems sensible enough to me my guess would also be that as they go on they will have to leave out a few more subplots and minor characters because inevitably the story grows as the books go on storm of swrods alone has enough in it for a couple of series which would be one option i suppose "
"104" "theballa" 2012-03-29 " lv09 monders lonepair renlys homosexuality is more than just alluded to in the books and loras "

"106" "SimonEllicott" 2012-03-29 " rome meets the sopranos with a bit of 70s german porn thrown into the mix with a dusting of magic so looking forward to this its going to be the highlight of the tv year  as other have said just wish it was on a mainstream channel rather than the obscure sky atlantic  "
"107" "5432Hun" 2012-03-29 " i really enjoyed the last season despite the entirely unnecessary titquota in every episode im no prude but it seemed almost like there was a certain target of female nudity required for each episode  got a tad tedious i think hbo have hit on a magic formula for maximising audience 1 faithful to the books for all the hardcore fantasy fans 2 great storytelling for peple who like hbos output 3 lots of tits for teenage boys of all ages "
"108" "LV09" 2012-03-29 " fingers in ears la la la la la dont mention anything else about storm of swords which im reading now la la la la "
"109" "Kezabien2" 2012-03-29 " out of all of the books that have been adapted for tv or film game of thrones is easily one of the best they didnt cut much out they havent changed a lot i really really hate it when they decide to change a character when in an adaptation and all the gore sex and epic storyline live upto how they are in the novels a clash of kings is fantastic so cant wait for season 2 to start next week with this and mad men it makes having sky worthwhile "
"110" "5432Hun" 2012-03-29 " very excited about this a couple of points which have come up btl i reread feast for crows and dance with dragons last month and second time around i enjoyed them a lot more especially ffc i think second time the new pov characters were less jarring also first time i read all the books in succession after watching series 1 and may have had a little bit of got fatigue someone said earlier they envy the poster who is half way through storm of swords id love to be able to read that book again everyone i know as they get to the end says either george martin you utter bastard or in the case of one of my wifes friends is in tears for a coupe of days but without being able to explain why to anyone who hasnt read it "
"111" "JamesWMoar" 2012-03-29 " did i read correctly late last year that the tv show will not really follow the books after this series because they become too hard to follow adequately that might just be an allusion to an intent to move away from the current one book  one tv season approach possibly splitting the next book into two seasons and interweaving books 4 and 5 because to a large extent they take place concurrently each book covering half the cast "
"112" "R042" 2012-03-29 " isnt this just shameful propaganda glorifying absolute monarchy and making acceptance of the feudal system seem acceptable though i jest im looking forward to this quite a bit the constraints of tv may do well to rein in the excesses of later books which could have done with better editing "
"113" "OyoySavaloy" 2012-03-29 " cant wait series one was the best tv of 2011 hope this also delivers "
"114" "ElDerino" 2012-03-29 " im guessing that murizio was referring to the second half of a storm of swords which is absolutely incredible whereas scipio16 was talking about the 4th and 5th books  in which case id agree with them both that said i think peoples reactions to the last 2 books partly depend on the length of waiting for them  people i know who only started the series recently enjoyed them more than those who had been waiting a long time for them "
"115" "orangescarves" 2012-03-29 " nothing homoerotic about that just two shirtless guys shaving each other like brosoh "
"116" "ciwstudent" 2012-03-29 " i think which books one likes versus which ones one thinks of as not so good depends rather a lot on which characters stories one finds the most interesting i really enjoyed a feast for crows because i liked the brienne jaime and cercei chapters bet of all i have been reading a dance with dragons since august and am finding it harder to get into because i dont find the danaerys and the various ironborn chapters as interesting but i suppose thats all a matter of personal preferenceim really looking forward to series 2 being televised "

"119" "SickSwan" 2012-03-29 " this started slowly but i persevered and by the time i got to episode 45 i was hooked luckily a friend of mine had given me the whole season at once and told me to watch it and to stick with it peter dinklage really makes this show for me his portrayal of the fast talking tyrion lannister is excellent and by far and away the most interesting character arc i could easily watch him as the central character to the whole thing i also liked the way daenerys targaryens character develops through the show and look forward to where it leads now shes  well youll know if youve seen it i found the starks a bit dull apart from ned but im guessing that changes for this season after the events of the last hope it lives up to its hype "

"124" "WalkerboyUK" 2012-03-29 " books 13 were superb but ive given up on a feast for crows i know there were reasons behind it but the introduction of major new characters made it feel very disjointed i picked it up again last week and finished a chapter and put it back on the shelf not in any rush to finish it did i read correctly late last year that the tv show will not really follow the books after this series because they become too hard to follow adequately "
