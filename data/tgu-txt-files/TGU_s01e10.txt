"3" "Kellathan" 2011-06-25 " as a person that watches a hell of a lot of tv got stands out above the rest bar boardwalk empire as a series that is gritty stylish smart sexy and classy the environment and back drops add to the quality as does the acting where i have to say peter dinklage who plays tyrion lannister stands above everyone else no pun intended and steals the show with his calibre of actingi never knew that the series was from books until my good friend nedshead told me i was surprised at the fact that after the first series we have already seen two of the most popular characters killed off its satisfying that we have a fantasy series where it’s not predictable an in fact it’s very appealing to all let’s hope this breaks the mould and doesn’t get axed after the first couple of series looking forward to more fighting boobs and dragons "
"4" "Cariad007" 2011-06-24 " im crushing on sir jorah  iain glen and emilia clarke have such great chemistry and the buildup has been so subtle it was ambiguous at first but now you can see that hes slowly fallen in love with her although how she feels about him is still not so clear id love to see them together at some point but i dont know if this will happen note im not a book reader yet so i dont want to know whether that does or doesnt happen interesting that so many people think that the only way it can all end is for jon and dany to end up together and crowned as king and queen again ive not read the books so can only speculate  i have my suspicions that jon is not neds son but his nephew the son of his sister lyanna but who is his father is it robert or is it rhaegar targaryan im inclined to believe its the former as if it was the latter it would make him danys nephew and then im not sure they could end up together then again a little bit of incest doesnt stop cersei and jaime "
"5" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-24 " also at gregdc  deli sadly deli that or its a typo thanks though ab47690  you are almost certainly right there was a time when i went out a lot she sighs nostalgically shexmus  i agree although i will say i thought the viserys scene did add character development and was well done aly81  exactly i thought that was a lovely subtle touch "
"6" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-24 " kulterager  ah now that we can agree on its my husbands favourite film great choice "
"7" "shexmus" 2011-06-24 " al shawerengen from deadwood would regularly be shown getting a blowjob by one of his whores while he would whinge about things in general i never considered those sexposition scenes as gratuitous since they added tremendously to als character and the scenes were always hilarious i mean nothing can beat the moment when al lashes out at the woman between his legs with did i tell you to lick my balls no then why do you lick my balls in game of thrones many sex scenes dont really add to the plot and character rather it seems as if they were meant to be sexy interludes for naughty boys ready willing and able to milk the eel in less than 3 minutes before normal programming resumes "
"8" "numsi1981" 2011-06-24 " just a technicality but the scene with ros and pycelle is not a sex scene but i dont wanna join the sexual freedom league with kulturtrager for my part i hope they keep the nudity count high as long as they do not show varys naked hodor with a hardon or little robert sucking on the right breast on another point just finished the first book and i still cannot believe that benioff and weiss did not show the battle at riverrun this is such a cool part of the book and it wouldnt have been too difficult to put it in the show also when tywin tells tyrion to go to kings landing become the hand i totally missed the point in the show i thought oh do we see some kind of bonding between the two when tywin says you go because you are my son yet in the book tyrion completely freaks out about it and doesnt understand it in a positive way at all "
"9" "FramplerandhisBox" 2011-06-24 " really enjoyed this series so much so that ive read all four books in the last few weeks without making any reference to plot developments i do worry how well the remaining books will translate to the screen  theyre still very enjoyable but the writing isnt as good or as cinematic as the first book and as sarah hughes rightly said theyre not as characterbased the true strength of this series for me has been how the characters came to life  with good source material the actors have put in some exceptional performances that really resonate another concern is how long george rr martin takes to write these books  i see from wikipedia that hes no spring chicken and at a rate of one book every 5 years one rather morbidly worries whether hell ever finish the series fortunately i seem to have discovered the books just before the fifth one is released but im sure ill grow frustrated with the wait for book 6 "
"10" "Kulturtrager" 2011-06-24 " sarah hughes fair enough i disagree with your analysis of the scenes but ive just watched its a wonderful life for the umpteenth time with my girlfriend who was seeing it for the first time and so i am full of nothing but love for the world tonight i bow out  "
"11" "ALY81" 2011-06-24 " love jorah nearly died at the expression on his face when dany kissed him also hurrah the hound finally emerges  he better get the dialogue and screen time he deserves next season "
"12" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-24 " and one final point damn you no edit button guardian  i know there are plenty of sex scenes and bedroom conversations in the books i think theyre better handled than here i dont really object as such to the scenes here i just felt that two of them the added in one with littlefinger and the pycelle scene were poorly written in contrast to the other written in scenes and well a little adolescent in their construction obviously i am also just intensely frustrated that they wrote in those scenes but chose not to show ned and cat in bed for the scene when they learn about jon arryn at the very beginning "
"13" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-24 " oh yeah also i didnt make up sexposition it was coined in the us press i just thought screw it might as well use it it saves space  im also a little lazy at times "
"14" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-24 " kulturtrager  hey i only did what i was asked do to  after week one the posters on here asked for a nudity count so i said yeah ok because it amused me mildly clearly the nudity count was never serious although you do seem rather determined to make it so did you really think i was genuinely offended by the pycelle scene because thats quite sweet if so and possibly the second best example on this blog of someone entirely missing the tone of a piece do i think sex is something to titter about no but i dont think this show always handled their sex scenes that well i appreciate they were trying to make a point that point was not always particularly well handled to quote someone far wiser than me if you have to shout about sex the whole time the chances are youre probably not getting that much to me game of throness sex scenes were often rather too much bluster and not enough point i have nothing against sex on television i certainly dont shade my eyes and go ooh no sex i just think it should add something or tell us something about the characters and a lot of times on game of thrones that didnt seem the case a couple of their scenes just appeared a little juvenile in contrast with the rest of the piece as to the alcohol thing trust me i have no shame if there was a ridiculous amount of drinking or drug taking in the show and the readers of this blog asked me to have a count i probably would im all about letting people have want they want on here terribly permissive i know "
"15" "JamesWMoar" 2011-06-24 " i dont know whether there was a dwarf character in the books at the first place but i now know that peter dinklage was born to play one of the inbred lannisters tyrions a dwarf in the books too the lannisters cerseis kids aside arent actually any more inbred than the next noble house "
"16" "bobnessuk" 2011-06-24 " looking through the blog there seems to be welldeserved praise for the series sandwiched between fierce arguments about the two ‘s’s’ – sex and spoilers so i might as well shove in my twopennith worth before the blog is closed downhow good do i think got is will you indulge me in a little ‘pycelle’ moment i remember many years ago seeing ‘apocalypse now’ at the cinema it was around the same time as ‘star wars’ had just come out at the beginning of the film there is a scene where martin sheen’s character has just been ordered to terminate colonel kurtz  “with extreme prejudice” this is obviously a very serious moment but is ruined by the fact that actor playing the officer was harrison ford “bloody hell” everyone in the audience cried “it’s han solo”well channel 4 is just about to start a new ‘comedy drama’ called ‘sirens’ i was watching a trailer for it yesterday that featured richard madden in one of the roles “bloody hell i cried “it’s rob stark” methinks that this may soon be a common reaction especially if it is repeated on a terrestrial channelas for the sex issue i personally feel that this was part and parcel of the whole got package one of the most fascinating things about the series was its lack of compromise it was perfectly willing to kill off central characters to show the sheer brutality of the times or the ambiguity of peoples’ morals if it had started getting all coy about the sex scenes then it would have affected the rest of the show as well as for spoilers i goodness i’m going all doddery againi recall what hywel bennett said during the first screening of ‘tinker tailor soldier spy” someone came up to him in a bar and offered him 1000 if he told him who the ‘mole’ was “i told him it would be a lot cheaper to read the book” replied mr bennettfor those who seem to be getting all king joffrey about spoilers i do suggest you read the books it can only end in tears or if you follow got philosophies ‘fingers and tongues” "
"17" "shexmus" 2011-06-24 " for a medieval fantasy there was remarkably little fantasy which is not necessarily a bad thing for this viewer who has issues with the fantasy genre in print as well as in moving pictures indeed the most fantastic bits in the series were confined to the beginning of the first episode where a blue eyed monster appears and towards the end of last episode with the rebirth in fire no less of cute little dragons i take it theyll grow to become big mean firebreathing dragons that will eventually fight on our side the blueeyed monster threat emerging from mordor oh pardon me i meant to say the threat that is emerging from behind the wall of the neighbourhood watch while there was little fantasy there was lots of sex and violence the problem with got is that while violence seems incidental to the plot the depiction of most sexual acts comes across as gratuitous and boringly longwinded and it hardly contributes to the story i can only assume that the amount of sex on got is intended to be some sort of taboobreaker for fantasy genre peter dinklage is the true star of the show i love every one of the scenes he appears i dont know whether there was a dwarf character in the books at the first place but i now know that peter dinklage was born to play one of the inbred lannisters there are some signposts to what may unfold i still maintain an earlier prediction that the bastard who joined the neighbourhood watch will lose his virginity to that platinum blonde nubile across the narrow sea his friend samwise tarly will become a wizard eddy stark may have lost his head but his spirit will live on and may even make a comeback like gandalf did catelyn starks neurotic sister will lose her realm to the uncivilised barbarians that just won a skirmish for lannisters arya will reunite with her sworddance master and that crippled boy will ride on one of those dragons got is nothing like the sopranos it is far inferior it is even lesser a tv series than its nearest equivalent rome which was cruelly restricted to only two seasons nevertheless got is quite watchable as a tv series "
"18" "Kulturtrager" 2011-06-24 " smartymcfly im sorry if ive given the impression that im not reading the responses i most certainly am giving them my full considerationim perfectly aware of what you are arguingi just simply disagree that the sex is any way shape or form superfluous to any scene i just dont get why anyone would comment on the sex for prudish reasons or otherwise i dont know how to make my points any clearerthe books are as concerned with sex as jane austens are with money "
"19" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-24 " kulturager you dont seem to be reading the responses to your comments you still seem to think a lot of the people here including me are railing against the sex in a prudish manner  if you actually read the responses it is not about the sex per se it is about the context for some of it i keep repeating that word some its because the criticism is aimed at certain scenes not the sex as such im not going to repeat the arguments that have already been made because theyve been made and if you want to take the time to read them they are all  as for hbo i tend to like their shows they do tend to push the boat out with original drama and they most certainly do use sex to bring in the subscribers their shows are littered with sex scenes that have little to do with plot development again im not being prudish about it merely stating that in some theres that word again of those scenes the sex is extraneous to the story being told sometimes it still works sometimes it doesnt and is jarring and actually gets in the way of storytelling i think in got there are a number of such scenes superfluous in there purely for titillation and unecessary for plot development  especially when harnessed to lengthy dialogue it is almost as if they have made a decision you see this lengthy bout of exposition  well viewers may get a little bored by it  if we show a few bums n boobs n bits it will keep them entertained whilst we do all the boring talky bits "
"20" "Kulturtrager" 2011-06-24 " diamonddag determined to argue over nothing no not at all im honestly of the opinion that too much is made of the sexual aspect of a game of thrones so i commented and i disagree that the sex at any time in the drama is unnecessary or simply there for titillation i mentioned censorship as a general point of order re sex in art not applying that point to the seriesi couldnt care less about getting into some back and forth with people i dont know i just write what im thinking and rebut what i find flawed rexposition any time the current king explains why he should be the one with the shiny toys "
"21" "DiamondDag" 2011-06-24 " kulturtrager you seem determinded to make an argument out of nothing sarah was clearly joking at the sight of pycelles transparent bed clothes youre right that sex scenes have their place in the series what people are objecting to is the stupid and lazy way that backstory is paired with the scenes its as if the writers couldnt find a way to explain something without boring the audience to death so they masked it with some boobs and no one has has mentioned censorship please stop trying to invent drama "
"22" "Rosimir" 2011-06-24 " im far less bothered by the sex scenes than by some of the accents the poor little minstrels dick van dykeworthy cod cockney for example if you can have an irish warrior with robb stark why not a scottish minstrel yet i know accents dont trouble all and positively bore some it takes all sorts "

"24" "CavalierDisregard" 2011-06-24 " kulturtrager hexposition i like it i wonder if shakespere coined that word when writing the start of macbeth "
"25" "Kulturtrager" 2011-06-24 " smartymcfly your point rests on whether or not a viewer senses that a scene has shoehorned sexmartins fictional world is drenched in actual sex and conversations about sex so to find sexual activity in any given scene to be superfluous is to me showing some problem with sex itself the producers are seeking to keep the spirit of the novelsand viserys is utterly sexual thus his representation seems perfectly sensible to me im not going to parse every single comment written about the sex in the scenes you mention but as a barometer please read again what ms hughes has written above blatant nudity my eyes may never recover restrained this is the language of someone who it could be claimed is at the least uncomfortable with sex try this analogywould she have an alcoholic drink count in her reviews it might read like this blatant drinking never get over tyrion drunk thank god they restrained themselves to one winethe drinking was clearly shoehorned into that meeting of robb and catelyn etc if she did so she would be ridiculed as drinking alcohol something i have never done is so normal and unremarkable in britain as to pass without notice in a television show but sex has to be tittered at or censored or deemed ridiculous or superfluous im sorry smarty but the sex in the series is totally in keeping with the spirit and flesh of the novelshbo is innocent of the charges mlud "
"26" "ab47690" 2011-06-24 " much as i enjoy game of thrones after reading your article i feel you should probably get out more "
"27" "5onthe5" 2011-06-24 " can i just say there is plenty of bad and unnecessary sex in the books too "
"28" "GregDC" 2011-06-23 " also sarah i have enjoyed your got reviews immensely and want to tell you that i too am writing from a little dell in brooklyn or did you mean deli as in delicatessen the guardian font is hard on the eyes "
"29" "GregDC" 2011-06-23 " i havent been able to run through all the comments so sorry if this has been addressed without revealing spoilers from the books what does everyone make of the witchs description of daenerys baby she described it as scaled like a lizard with bat wings are we supposed to believe that daenerys was to give birth to a dragon herself "
"30" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-23 " i have read the books and i know grrm uses sex quite a bit in there i also dont think he is immune from the criticism that some of the sex is gratiutious either the criticism at the tv show is aimed at some of the scenes not all and is not at the sex in particular but the rather ludicrous juxtaposition of unrelated lengthy dialogue with the sex most of the criticism i have read are not being prudish  i dont have a particular problem with seeing sex in tv shows yet i still found a few scenes superfluous three scenes in particular appear to have garnered the most criticism  2 of which i would agree with to a certain extent viserys  dorah  in the bath littlefinger  ros  other pycelle  ros the pycelle and ros i thought actually brought something new to the plot and has added slightly more depth to pycelle than is present in the book there are also a few seeds planted in that scene so to speak the other 2 so obviously had sex shoehorned into the scene the conversations could easily have been had without it  in fact either scene could have arguably have been dropped altogether  particularly the littlefinger one as it possibly took away an element of suprise from what was due to unfold later on "
"31" "Kulturtrager" 2011-06-23 " perhaps you have not read the novels smartymcfly if you have then you should be aware that martin enjoys using bedroom scenes for conversation thus the occurrence of the same in the television adaptation thus the sex scenes are actually in fact called for and to be shown at length with characters chatting fucking showing skinand whatever else happens between two people involved in a natural daily activity so that being said to criticise the sex in a game of thrones comes across as prudish to me for my part its as silly to even notice the sex and then to make up a stupid word like sexposition as it would be to contrive hexposition for a scene with two witches explaining their evil plots "
"32" "smilerone" 2011-06-23 " this has been an excellent dramawith some outstanding acting from all involved particularly like michelle fairley as catelyn who brings an inner core of steel to her role watching her console her son and saying we will save you sisters and kill them all made for compulsive viewing although no lover of the fantasy genre and despite the appearance of cgi dragons at the end im hooked and looking forward to series 2 never heard of got until the series started however will resist the temptation to dive into the booksits now the tv series for me "
"33" "Spikediswhack" 2011-06-23 " i started watcing the series this week and looked at the review of episode one there were two nice big spoilers from people whod read the books there so i just want to say thanks to those of you who are total well you get the idea "
"34" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-23 " kulturtrage and thirdly quit whinging about the whinging about sex scenes it just makes you sound like a contrarian attention seeker seriously i dont think many people here have been criticising the sex scenes for the sex as such more the gratutiousness of some of it and the tendency to use them for prolonged unrelated exposition i personally quite like the term sexposition  it does exactly what it says on the tin when it comes to describing what has been happening in the production "
"35" "Kulturtrager" 2011-06-23 " ms hughes you have done a solid series so far but firstly for the love of all thats holy drop this ridiculous term sexposition its not only cringeworthy but its meaningless exposition is exposition and secondly quit whinging about sex scenes you come across like a 12 years old alternately shocked and fascinated by the everyday occurrence of sex "
"36" "MagnusGreel" 2011-06-23 " nudity  sex what an awesome series but talking of sex scenes and nudity the tone of the 1st ep was so geared towards teenage males and presumably cigarchomping libidinous middleaged tv execs with no imagination that i almost didnt go back for part 2 glad i did and for the modst part the nudity sex etc hasnt felt gratuitous one thing  can you stop cataloguing the nudity count in your blog please its embarrassing "
"37" "reverber8" 2011-06-23 " firstly kudos to the team behind the series  a making a production spanning locations from malta to ireland and doing it pretty darn well is something of a collaborative feat in general the series so far has been a feast of welljudged scripting casting and direction and i think the series finale has lived up to the high expectations emilia clarke truly has come into her own and her daenerys which started off little more than wishywashy blonde has truly grown to fill the increasingly urgent drama happening on the other side of the narrow sea dragons three of em little bitsy ones i hope and pray that the magical elements which so far has been on the sidelines of what is at its heart a compelling human drama wont upset the balance of fantasy and realism that has made the show so riveting god help us all if this devolves into eragon territory another character making bigger strides is sansa who now has to choose daily between honourable death and life as a gilded prisoner goffrey makes an unlikely but very capable caligula and heaps some truly horrific abuse on sansa you can see some inner steel developing in her though which makes her interesting to watch the hounds surprising intervention in saving sansa and jorahs short but touching scenes with daenerys just show what a wealth of interesting characters this series has i disagree with ms hughes on pycelle though  although it did slow the pace of the story somewhat  i thought it was hilarious what with the postcoital calisthenics and the lets put on the doddering old fool face before he starts off for the day fantasy doesnt normally give older actors much more to do than play old grouches or wise sagementors and i hope they do more with pycelle here "
"38" "CharlieBronze" 2011-06-22 " there are so many characters whose fates im invested in but one character im intrigued to see more of next season is barristan selmy i loved his defiance when he was dismissed from court by joffrey hopefully his nobility and honour wont prove to be as much of a fatal flaw as it was for ned stark "
"39" "KarolusAfricanus" 2011-06-22 " sunburst yes i agree with that both scenes are so unimportant or irrelevant as they appear to be at first sight and yes weiss and benioff did a real good job out of the material i think just like the book is improved by a second reading this whole season warrants a second viewing that would validate if maybe not all then almost all their choices in terms of scenes shown or deleted compared to the source material "
"40" "Gibbus" 2011-06-22 " some serious box in this programme "
"41" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-22 " sunburst interesting analysis ill have to watch those scenes again youve certainly made me want to interesting points re benioff and weiss too  i actually think that to address something raised earlier they would adapt book 4 very well for those very reasons "
"42" "Sunburst" 2011-06-22 " ive just rewatched some of the scenes now it seems to me that the pycelle and ros scene is actually really good and serves an important function he gets himself a whore and has his fun and then his tongue slips  he nearly blurts out what he really thinks of all the bloody kings hes had to endure but  hes lucid enough to realise that ros is very likely a spy varys or littlefingers or perhaps cerseis and you can see it on his face when he stops talking  his mind is fast he immediately starts his dull babbling that reveals nothing and bores ros to tears and when she presses him to actually say what hed meant to say at the beginning he pretends even more that he doesnt remember and she just gives up and then he starts jumping up and down and we see that not just his mind but his body is in a good shape too and then he puts on his robe and chain and goes for the door and immediately assumes a weak slouching pose he knows how to play his role and he does it brilliantly in fact hes fooled everyone at court perhaps even littlefinger and varys he might be one of the most dangerous players in the game so the scene was actually brilliant for telling us all that and since tyrion is coming to kings landing imagine the scale of the intrigues  tyrion littlefinger varys cersei and pycelle together in the same castle i cant wait  then the varyslittlefinger scene aside from the witty banter we see that the two of them are extremely alike  both have risen from almost nothing unlike everyone else around them who inherited their wealth and power and they know that they are birds of a feather and respect and admire each other for that but respect is not the only thing here  when varys sees joffrey entering the hall he immediately bows his head and says and we serve the rightful king thus signalling to littlefinger shut your bloody mouth hes here and littlefinger realises immediately and joins in so they are watching each others back and even though theyre rivals they obviously feel more kinship and loyalty for each other than for anyone else least of all the kings they serve in fact with the two of them clever and devious cooperating in this way the kings are merely blind pawns in their hands and whats interesting  i never noticed all this from the books just from these two scenes but it fits with the books of course and expands on them wonderfully which leads me to conclude that benioff and weiss are much more intelligent and capable writers than martin hes great at plotting and worldbuilding but they have improved on his work immensely giving it more depth and logic especially when it comes to the characters like cersei catelyn and robb and these three courtly schemers "

"48" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-22 " mauritianarian look i accept its badly structured and i asked them to remove it although they havent but i honestly meant it to read as which moment would you like to see happen as in a purely speculative which great thing if you were writing the show would you like to see happen most so the whole justice to joffrey thing was nothing to do with what may or may not happen in the books and entirely to do with isnt that what everyone wants to see given what a little shit he is anyway im sorry you didnt read it that way this blog has never spoilered and never would but do you think in future that if you disagree you could manage to do so with out being gratuitously rude thanks "

"52" "JoeOrdinary" 2011-06-22 " loved the series  which i didnt think i would after episode 1 i thought the nudity was gratuitous in that episode and simply wasnt necessary im not a prude i just like good story telling and thought it got in the way episode 2 onwards and it improved immensely and especially handled the politics well nice to hear some good heartfelt northern swearing used to good effect especially from king robert i liked the story arc but i have my misgivings about where i think it may go after this the biggest mistep however was that pillow ive seen the exact same one in dunelm for a tenner can we have a special category in awards ceremonys from now on  best actor under 4 6 "
"53" "Pillowhead" 2011-06-22 " mauritianarian well maybe thats how you read it and i can see how even though i personally took it to mean something entirely different but the intention which is what is key here was to create debate based on what we have seen so i wouldnt worry about it as like i said these things may or may not happen like you say arguing about semantics is boring so lets put it to bed now and be happy that nobody has listed a whole list of definite spoilers we know to be true "
"54" "amypoodle" 2011-06-22 " also mauritianarian do you really expect anyone here who cares about not spoiling the books for newbies to confirm or deny the coming to pass of any of sarahs discussion starters really to be honest though youve kind of forced people into a position where they sort of have and thats really annoying isnt it i understand why it irked when you thought youd been spoiled but that youre still cursing and swearing away even after sarah and the rest did their best to explain and placate even in sarahs case going so far as to apologise for any lack of clarity doesnt reflect too well on your social skills no sir as for the bloke who stomped off in a hissy fit because of the dragons well theres just no point getting into it with someone like that "

"58" "Pillowhead" 2011-06-22 " mauritianarian as people have continually complained on this here blog confirming what doesnt happen is just as big a spoiler as confirming what does the point is as per sarah hughes original blog post speculating what you want to see happen so yes all of these things might happen or they might not i can sort of see where the misunderstanding has come in but to me at least having followed the blog it was pretty clear the intention of the post was to stimulate conversation about what people wanted to see in season 2 "

"62" "ScottyMuser" 2011-06-22 " mauritiaarian  nope your reading of the sentence is wrong it is a deliberately ambiguous sentence with probably the most common use actually being the hypothetical  you dont really need a hypothetically speaking style of prefix to a question to have a question be hypothetical  it is all about the context an ambiguous sentence is in for instance if i said lets go to the movies what do you want to watch and listed a number of films would you automatically assume we were going to see all of them or that we couldsee 1 of them if they were even on youd assume the second meaningthe hypothetical due to the context in this case the context is clear  it is on a blog which althoguh written by someone who has read the books has on multiple occassions asked people not to post anything even remotelyspoilery in the comments and has always endeavoured not to mention anything even backstory from the books given the context therefore you have managed somehow and i still cant understand how think the question wasnt the hypothetical what do you want to happen folllowed by a list of things the author thinks people as she does would like to see happen due to peoples reactions in the past over cdertain characters and events which it clearly was instead you managed to construe it asi know i have asked people in the comments not to even mention the books even though there is some material in book 1 which would help with viewers understanding of things but i dont care i am going to break my own rules because i feel like being annoying these things will happen in the next seriesbooks  which do you want to see happen first next time maybe read a little more clearly the context of the question before getting on your high horse about the author of the blog spoiling things by telling you what is going to happen when she is posing a hypothetical question maybe "

"130" "Jonnytheshirt" 2011-06-21 " 50nthe5  the wheel of time is the classic example of an epic book series gone wrong 13 maybe even 4 were pretty good and then everything went to pot by about book 11 i seriously lost count and was speed reading by that stage robert jordan sadly died the writer hired to finish things off in 3 books now however has recieved praise for putting things back on track jordan however does not match martins writing talent and remember martin wrote this with tv series experience and that idea way in the back of his mind which is why the books though large rollick along nicely final thought surprising character i warmed to more in the series varys  excellent work by conleth hill on a character i still had trouble visualising from the books "
"131" "willowroolz" 2011-06-21 "  destraint yes my call would be for the malazan book of the fallen as well  but i reckon it might be unfilmable just for the huge battles and bewilderingly complex stories ive read them twice and still cant make headortail of some of it i actually prefer it to a song of ice  fire though so many brilliant characters and epic plotlines i believe erikson once contemplated turning the chain of dogs storyline into a movie script but it didnt go much further than that "
"132" "ThePaladin" 2011-06-21 " the series is actually better than its source material as it doesnt suffer from martins rambling exposition and pointlessly weighted characters with exaggerated flaws that he mentions every time they turn up the bit part characters are far stronger in the series than they are in the books bronn as likeable as he is in the books is so much more awesome in the series what he was missing in the books is his accent before then he was just a cad and a dirty bastard in the series hes got charm catelyn literally doesnt stop whining in the books and is annoying in the series her actress recasts as a worrying but thoroughly english mother shes a far more flinty and far easier to root for similarly shae is far more interesting than her boring portrayal in the books as is bran who while having the same speaking parts has all his cut down to a few minutes rather than the interminable boredom his parts usually are if im honest if you havent read the books dont let the series provide the enjoyment still not the strongest series ive seen though battlestar galactica is still the better series "
"133" "MoreTears" 2011-06-21 " 5onthe5 since your first question isnt what fantasy books should be picked up for adaptation but which ones will be i can tell you that hbo has already picked up adaptation rights for neil gaimans fantasy book american gods the project is in development which may mean it never makes it to series but right now that is the only other fantasy project hbo has in the pipeline "

"137" "Destraint" 2011-06-21 " 5onthe5 wheel of times good but more standard fantasy than got classic start of three young farm boys plucked from their homes and plunged into adventure it gets more interesting a lot of the premise of the series is actually looking at the hero dealing with suddenly having the weight of the world on his shoulders and the characters are well done but as a series it does have a massive flaw with pacing where from about book 710 nothing much really gets accomplished other than wot theres joe abercrombies first law trilogy i found it a bit too much got lite but from talking to others im in the distinct minority in that position its certainly the closest in tone i could think of theres also scott lynchs lies of locke lamora which while different in tone its very much a fantasy version of hustle is another good modern fantasy series finally my personal favourite is steven eriksons malazan book of the fallen another sprawling epic fantasy series of 10 books with multiple viewpoint characters though its now finished unlike got for example its a lot more obvious fantasy you deal with armies with their own mage cadres and gods get involved in mortal affairs but the world created is one of the most interesting ive encountered and the plotlines strong one thing that is very much a love it or hate it affair though is that theres hardly any exposition youre very much left to pick up the context as it goes along from bits oh peoples conversations so youll have to think whether youd be fine with that "

"140" "5onthe5" 2011-06-21 " fantasy fans  which other books  series of books do you think will be picked up for adaptation now and which would be worth reading for got fans i hear a lot about wheel of time  is that the same sort of thing or very different what other works are out there "

"142" "ignatieff88" 2011-06-21 " this has been the best show i have ever seen i hope hbo decide to throw more money at it for series 2best actor on the show i would not give the award to peter drinklage because i feel his accent wavered at times plus it was an easier part to play in that he got the best lines for me michelle fairley stood out in creating a sympathetic and strong character in catelyn by something as simple as a facial expression give her the emmy "
"143" "WalkerboyUK" 2011-06-21 " i saw the scene with ros and pycelle being just as much about her as it was about him yes it seemed to focus on the fact that he is acting as an old doddery man when in fact hes remarkably healthy loved the bit where he had to readjust as he opened the door but at the same time it was made evident that ros wanted to get information about the kings  so whats the thing about kings i can see her being a spy sent in by robb to subtly fit in but gather all the important information without being figured out i also guessed that the armoury lad that we saw was another bastard son think i may have to put a request in for the books to be a birthday present "
"144" "Lauralol" 2011-06-21 " loved the show i think it is a great piece of television and cant wait to get stuck into the books the series left me rooting more for the bastards and underdogs than either the starks or the lannisters both houses are equally to blame for the impending war what is catlyn doing leaving her two youngest sons vulnerable and alone back at winterfell for all of cerseis bad intentions she at least protects her children and sticks with them it is just my opinion but cersei and catlyn are playing different sides of the same coin both want glory both want their families to come out on top and both will stop at nothing to do it cant wait to see whether king roberts bastard son makes it to the wall or whether he joins the war with rob i think it will be interesting to see ned and roberts sons meet each other and whether they will form a close bond as their fathers did or whether it will make for conflict at the nightswatch i also hope that the hound falls in love with sansa at least then she will have some protection at court no one is looking out for her at the moment if i was catlyn i coerce rob to jaime for sansa but she is just as blinded by revenge as all the others i was a little bit dissapointed with danys moment of glory it was a tricky thing to accomplish what with the fire and the dragons and it nearly succeeded in not looking cheesy but i couldnt help supress a smirk when she stood up and all that was covering her nether regions were two baby dragons still 10 out 10 for effort on the magic front but i am still more mesmerised by bran and now rickons vision what is the 3 eyed crow all about cant wait for the next series  i really cant so i am cracking on with the books "

"146" "thewansteadimp" 2011-06-21 " loved the series about to embark on the books i think the series has me seeing conspericies everywhere the cersei lancel thing cersei has previously commented about having children with jamie to keep the true blood lannisters going is her fling with lancel an admission she has failed with joffrey i think the scene was post tongue extraction where she was giving him the evil eye again and that she will off him in due course to be replaced with a new heir fathered by lancel are the time frames small enough that she could pass a new baby off as look what king robert left before he died or does she just really dig her family as i said conspirecy theories everywhere best get on and read the books "
"147" "macster" 2011-06-21 " great stuff again reminded me of a lot of other hbo stuff where the big climax is in the penultimate episode and the final episode shows the aftermathrepercussions i loved the varyslittlefinger scene  aiden gillan was less obviously moustachetwirlingly bad and conleth hills varys has been a real treat of the series and to me anyway seemed to mark the end of the first story  in all the scenes after the other players were kicked off onto new journeys the series as a whole has been superbly done i think things were a little too stilted at points especially in the first half of the season  i think the writersactors were too deferential to the source material this last episode though showed far more confidence anyway looking forward to seeing ros the pros using all the knowledge shes got from hanging around all these important naked people to make a claim for the throne ros for queen "
"148" "CavalierDisregard" 2011-06-21 " great series enjoyed it all immensely although must admit to feeling this episode was a slight anticlimax after last weeks i was hoping we would get to see a massive battle between the starks and the lannisters but realistically with the budget i suppose that was unlikely i also must admit that when the northerners started chanting king of the north being a southerner and with a mockney accent to boot my allegiances may have turned slightly to the lannisters lets hope game of thrones is not responsible for the next british civil war personally i thought the pycelle scene was very revealing showing that although he seems the doddery old man he is actually very switched on and aware of all the machinations going on on a final point for now anyway i disagree with the complaints about too much nudity and sexposition to paraphrase joey tribianni how do i feel about full frontal nudity i dont rent a movie without it "
"149" "willowroolz" 2011-06-21 " this blog had been great fun to follow each week thanks  my first post though first off ive read the books  thats the last time ill mention them for the first half of the season i thought the show was very good but there were a few minor niggles that were stopping me from fully giving in to it the pacing seemed a little hectic and they werent doing a good job of showing the passage of time as mentioned earlier in this thread i was also getting fed up with a friend of mine constantly moaning about the nudity rather than being able to talk to them about the story and the characters  that aside ive thought the last four or five episodes have gone from strength to strength i understand what people have been saying about episode 9 being the finale and it was stunning but i thought episode 10 was simply awesome it started out with several very emotional scenes sansas scenes in particular were brilliant  well done sophie and then built steadily to an amazing crescendo i had to rewatch the final scene several times it was just so well done and exactly as i imagined it  i actually punched the air in a uniformly excellent cast i have to give special praise to young maisie williams arya was always my favourite character in the book damn mentioned it again and she has done a quite wonderful job of bringing her to life stealing practically every scene she has been in praise for hbo too for producing a fantasy series with such lavish attention when what we normally get is so cringeinducing i feel that i could now go back and watch the first few episodes and actually give them the attention they deserved it has turned out to be easily the best book to screen adaptation ive yet seen in the genre is it next april yet "
"150" "EddieLarkin" 2011-06-21 " although i am very jealous of nonbook readers being able to experience this story for the first time in a visual medium i assure you that reading ahead will not take away from the series at all all of us book fans have enjoyed it immensely and as said previously as good as the show is it only scratches the surface of the books at the very least i implore everyone to read the first book in preperation for season 2 so youve got every bit of detail you need going into part 2 "

"156" "JamesWMoar" 2011-06-21 " kegriredi think theyre intended as natural speculation based on the end of series 1 though they could have been better marked hope its not saying too much to tell you that theyre actually not accurate spoilers "
"157" "lmsava" 2011-06-21 " all felt like a good tie up everything was going to be an anticlimax after neds beheading but the rebirth of the dragons was as good as could have been hoped for i think both that scene and robbs crowning could have done with more buildup  it kind of looked like the greatjon just had an idea on the spur of the moment whereas it genuinely built to the king in the north moment in the book days last scene could also have been heightened by showing her bodyguards except jorah saying that they couldnt follow her any longer just to ratchet up the feeling that things were falling apart around her overall the series has been amazing television small complaints are the lack of direwolf action and too much pointless sex theres sex in the books but it never feels unnecessary as it has on occasion in the series that aside the acting and writing has been superb if you can invest in characters you can forgive a lot on the production side such as limited fx shots ill be interested how they handle some of the scenes in future series heres hoping hbo commit more to the budget for some episodes "
"158" "Pillowhead" 2011-06-21 " kegrired thanks s bunch for the future spoilers you warned only about episode spoilers danys dragons burn down kings landing im in the middle of reading books gahhh if youre refering to sarah hughes blog she is talking in terms of what we want to happen rather than revealing spoliers although it is totally feasible that those things could happen she doesnt mean they definitely will "
"159" "Pillowhead" 2011-06-21 " also the actress playing osha is really good and the scene with tywin just served to show what a badass he is he knows exactly how to play the game and is aware of how stupid the beheading of ned was the man is a lesson in real politik in terms of anticlimax all this part of the story does is set things up for the next series very nicely indeed in my opinion the cliffhanger moment was with ned last week if they get series 2 right itll be awesome "

"161" "HummDrumm" 2011-06-21 " it seems a shame that some people feel this episode was an anticlimax i dont think it would have been possible to end on a cliffhangar like neds beheading as there has to be some aftermath and as we know that season 2 is coming events need to be set up to lead into that i thought the wall marching off north was excellent arya being bundled off was great though it would have been nice to linger on the prisoners in the cart a bit more and as mentioned above aryas treatment of hotpie is far more brutal sansa is trapped and conveys that wonderfully the scene with the heads was just like the book and the ending was fantastic i would also highly recommend the first book to anyone thinking of skipping it  the writing of the episode with dany the funeral pyre and the birth of the dragons is just breathtaking "
"162" "Pillowhead" 2011-06-21 " well i was mighty concerned about how the dragons would turn out and they didnt look too bad pretty evil looking and the cgi wasnt disasterous the way i like to think of them in terms of the story is not really magical but like a seriously heavy piece of weaponry only with dragons was it possible to unite the 7 kingdoms they are like medieval nukes agree largely with sarah hughes i didnt think they made enough of the the king in the north scene which in the book came across as a far more moving scene especially in the context of knowing what happened in the battle and who got killed and wasted time on varys and littlefinger and pycelle really liked the scene with sansa and joffrey thought the actress who plays her has really come on in the book because you know what shes thinking you know exactly how shes dealing with it all thought she did really well at portraying how she felt i like the guy whos playing yoren but i did imagine him as a bit dirtier that whole scene at the start where he cuts her hair is quite confusing in the book and for possibly the first time benefited from being on screen was the blonde kid or the fat one hot pie i forget "

"166" "numsi1981" 2011-06-21 " fantastic season finale i completely agree with another commentator that good shows have their climax in the penultimate episode and in the last one set the stage for the next season just imagine that they had ended the season with neds beheading  outrageous some thoughts i also thought that sansa would jump when she was standing on the bridge alone thank the old gods she didnt cause i just like the way her whole world fell apart and joffrey did not turn out to be the dreamy prince at all it will be utterly interesting to see this storyline develop how touching was that scene between robb and catelyn one of the best lines in the show so far first we have to get your sisters and the we will kill them all i cant wait to see a fight between greatjon umber and the mountain dont know if that is going to happen but the stage is set what an utter nonsense to suggest that sean bean was happy to leave the show yesterday i read an interview with him where he literally says sometimes i go aw sht bring me back dude if you do not like fantasy then do not watch the show dragons and undead are some of the most common themes in the genre and george martin has managed to put them into play in a noncheesy way sort of like a cross between the wire lord of the rings and a 70s german porn film that made me laugh particularly because in my youth those german softporn movies were all over the place we have a nice word for such movies sexklamotte i suggest that this becomes a common term in english   scottymuser thanks for writing up my exact same thoughts on the pycell scene the nudity might have been gratuitous but i just assume that the revelation of pycells true nature will be an important part in the second seasonbook equally although i had a dejavu with the varyslittlefinger scene it was meant to show that the game of thrones is not only played by the lannisters starks etc but also by the kings council and probably in an equally important way so for me this was not boring or uninteresting  sarah and all commentators thanks for this outstanding blog it has been a pleasure to read it every tuesday morning hope to see you next year again for my part i will continue with the books and become somebody who exactly knows what is going to happen in the show yet i am pretty confident that i can enjoy the show as much as a nonreader "

"171" "DrQuinzel" 2011-06-21 " im looking forward to reading through all of these comments in my lunchtime but in the meantime i thought this episode was a little weaker than last weeks neds death was the series biggest narrative bomb and this episode felt underpowered in comparison it was also guilty of putting more effort into setting up season 2 than in bringing season 1 to a denouement which might be an accusation you can also level at the last few chapters in the book i dont know but as always some great moments love that most of the characters are caught up in the kings landing machinations only a brave few are looking towards the dangers beyond the wall and absolutely noone is paying any attention to the rightful queen with the bloody dragons across the sea dragons yay nice bit of special effects work there also enjoyed the fact that this episode took the two weak women from episode one  dany and sansa  and turned them around dany is fullon husbandmurdering witchburning dragonwrangling powerful now and sansa while not having undergone quite as dramatic a transformation is beginning to find her balls as the last stark trapped in kings landing wish she had pushed joffrey off that walkway lil bastard cant wait for tyrion to bitchslap him back into line in fact cant wait for tyrion to get stuck into the political backstabbing full stop littlefinger and varys may have met their match the episode was slightly marred by the fact that i was watching with my housemates who yelled boobs at regular intervals they even yelled boobs in cerseis bedchamber only to be left feeling somewhat conflicted when the lithe longhaired wench turned out to be lancel who is a bloke "
"172" "WalkerboyUK" 2011-06-21 " i was a bit disappointed in it which is somewhat understandable after last weeks finale i never got around to commenting when the issue first arose but would i be way off mark in suggesting that maybe drogo was never the father of the babymaybe its because weve seen the incest with jaime  cersei or the fact that the timeline with the pregnancy seemed off with the rest of what we saw but i thought the father was danys brother i just pictured it all going wrong when the kid was born i knew that dany would survive the fire as we were shown that heat didnt affect her in one of the earlier episodes loved tyrion commenting about his dad being a cunt seems like it runs in the family joffrey neilcaraldo  im kind of with you but at the same time i kind of expected itthe dragons at the end ruined it a bit for me as the majority of the fantasy element had been absent throughout the series yes the whitewalkers were present but in my mind that wasnt quite the same its certainly not going to put me off watching a 2nd series oh  ok i submit on the advertising breaks i was wrong "

"176" "Jonnytheshirt" 2011-06-21 " tip top adaptation from my favourite books so much more is in the books but also the chararcterisation on screen has been fantastic to see plus a real bonus has been this blog and others to catch up with especially nonreaders reactions as to the sansaroz hair style  its mentioned in the although perhaps not the series how sansa starts wearing her hair in the southern style and dressing in the southern style not too long after she arrives in kings landing off course trying her best to fit in this is the style rozs hair is now in i dont believe pycelle has anything funky going on regarding sansa its just the fashion of the time consistent with the high quality of custume and design the shows put out roll on july 12th for us readers and next year producers are already here in belfast starting filming next month "

"203" "ScottyMuser" 2011-06-21 " first time commenter have read the books a while back but couldnt remember to many pertinent details show was magnificent easily one of the best dramas in years better than rome imo in terms of hbo offerings thought id commment re the overuse of gratuitous sexposition  i actually think the last episodes use was not in the slightest bit as bad as any of the others why you may ask well it was something i was thinking about after and i realised again cant even remember much about the books so this is going simply off the show that it showed pycelle off rather well developing his character bear with me it is rather long 1 in the show so far save a bit of verbal shouting at sansa he has been shown as quite a weakling character someone who is tolerated as he is old and doddery and even though likely a lannister man the others especially varys and littlefinger are willing to tolerate him as he is not a threat to them inthe game2 with this supposition varys and littlefinger have in part left themselves slightly vulnerable in terms of not knowing the strength of pycelle one who could play a major part ion the game3 the sexposition was so that pycelle could mouthg eulogie about the mad king robert  joffrey  pleasing any of the hidden spies who may be listening 4 its a good introduction to just how long pycelle has been around getting viewers to question how someone as senileforgetful as him can supposedly have known that many kings etc  also the fact that he mustr know an immense lot5 given the fact it seems public knowledge by varys that littlefinger owns a brothel where a lot of the noblesmen in power go and he uses that as his information gathering network its reasonable to assume pycelle does  and he knows littlefinger as the one behind cerseijoffrey witness his promising of the guard to ned would be interested to hear what he says so he rambles on about robert being a good man but not necessarily a good king joffrey has the potential of greatnessthen stops seemingly at an end not knowing where he started showing littlefinger he a isnt a threat b supports joffrey so isnt likely to rise against him and c as roz is in the room she can see how decrepit and oldforgetful he is as soon as roz disappears out of the room he straightens up doers some exercises more suited to somoene 30 years his junior and basically shows us the viewer he is a lot more limber both physically and by extension mentally then they give him credit for  and that makes us the viewer think that he is a true player in the game of thrones and that littlefinger and varys could be unwise to continue to underestimate him  his years in service part of the monologue probably enforces the idea he has forgotten more about courtly intrigue than even the likes of varys and littlefinger are likely to know thus it rounds off him as a character rather well promising more for the next season "
"204" "TinyFemaleWriter" 2011-06-21 " sarah who is the random brit of the week great series and a fantastic blog that has made me think more about the story and the characters than i otherwise would have lets do that again next year i had assumed that only one dragon would hatch at a time  as in one dragon for one person  and now we have three i hope we wont get too many cute kittens dragon videos in the next series maester pycelle at first i thought the old frail soul was about to have a heart attack after an exhausting hour with roz how wrong was i he is clearly into sansa rozs hairdo and very physically able though he pretends not to be so yes that does change our picture of him and the balance of power in court not the most important of scenes but an interesting detail the first two books of songs of fire and ice were delivered on friday what a great day that was  the same day i got a phone call telling me my short play had reached the final 28 in the off cut festival yay and i have already lost all sense of time and place in this supposedly real world "

"208" "Werthead" 2011-06-21 " this episode was interesting as they brought forwards a couple of scenes from the start of book 2 i have a feeling that fairly early on the writers were told that season 2 was only going to be 10 episodes as well despite book 2 being 100 pages longer than book 1 so they decided to bring forward as many elements as possible to lighten the load when it came to adapting book 2 shes been through a whole pregnancy but surely nine months havent elapsed for ned  rob etc i dont think she made it to term in fact episode 9 was the first time she had even a mild bump and she looked more like she was 45 months at best although if it was only 45 months she should probably have fully expected to lose the baby given the society that more or less tracks with earlier episodes it takes ned a month to travel to kings landing then cat shows up a few days later then she travels halfway home before meeting tyrion then theres the trip to the vale and back again and then robb raises his army and marches it most of the way south etc you can stretch it out to 34 months i think fairly easily without any problems and a bit more than that if you close one eye and assume that ned was in the dungeons for weeks rather than the few days it felt like on tv "

"211" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-20 " first  as already mentioned i just wanted to add my thanks to sarah and the blog it has been one of the most enjoyable places to come and readpost about the show i always felt that this episode would be a case of the morning after the night before it seems to follow a distinct pattern to some of the better series particularly the sopranos when the climax occurs in the penultimate show and the finale is more a scene setter for the next series is ros on some sort of performance related pay system  she really does seem to be working her butt off sarah  i also felt that the sexposition scene this week was a bit much  but i can see a reason for it beyond the falsity of his frail frame it is a bit of a tenuous reason but nevertheless i think there is something in that scene to anyone who is thinking of skipping book 1 and jumping straight into book 2 after the tv show  i would personally recommend reading the first book  for the reasons already suggested by others the books do spend some time establishing the characters and for some key characters there is more subtle development in the text and certainly more about motivation there are little things in there that link to events later on that are easy to miss too i would echo most of the other thoughts here  it has been a fantastic series not quite one of the great hbo productions of the last 10 years the sopranos deadwood  rome  but definitely the best of the rest the main weak point for me has been the portrayal of littlefinger whilst it has been a strong acting performance from gillen it has been a little onedimensional in terms of plot development and character in the books he has always been a bit more difficult to pin down you never really know any motivation and there was always a lot more uncertainty in his actions the tv series has had him set up more as vergingonthevillaneous from day 1 a few other weaknesses were prevailant frequency of sexposition but they were all pretty minor and nothing stopped me from thoroughly enjoying the series i know it has been said often enough too  the biggest success of the series has been the almost faultless casting particularly of the younger actors  but the strength and depth of the rest of the cast has helped  and i cant tell you how many times weve said oh thats thingy off whats it called  cant wait to see what they do with a clash of kings book 2 thanks again folks  great blog "

"217" "MJNoble" 2011-06-20 " am i right in thinking that the dany storyline begins some time before the starklannister story shes been through a whole pregnancy but surely nine months havent elapsed for ned  rob etc theyre broadly contemporaneous recall the assassination attempt following discussions in council but overall there is a lot of time dilation going on its been a long time since ned executed the deserter "

"225" "HodorsWang" 2011-06-20 " although this show has been an incredibly close adaptation i would highly recommened not to do this there are nearly 100 minor characters introduced in the first book that are not mentioned in the show due to lack of importance and although most remain unimportant their continued appearences in the subsequent books would lead to a lot of confusion if you just started at book 2 not to mention the much more in depth information you get in the first book about westeros and its history there was a lot of future foreshadowing skipped over as well  about 10 prophetic dreams that are in the book were not featured in the show i agree entirely while you could jump straight into book 2 reading the first will enhance the show and other books massively even on your third and fourth reads of them you will pick up extra little details which really flesh out the story and the world in general the show sticking so closely to the books is one of the reasons it has been so fantastic "
