"4" "crehane" 2013-05-13 " willowight  hi willowight the way i would interpret it is that if everything he told theon was a lie then that includes telling him that he was karstarks son besides he has theon strapped to an x shaped torture rack and hes flaying his little finger considering their sigil its all too boltonlike to be anything but the activities of a bolton in the secret torture chambers of the dreadfort "
"5" "Elspeth25" 2013-05-13 " ntofr1  not just me then  "
"6" "willowight" 2013-05-13 " thenorthremembers  yes my logical conclusion was that there was only one person it could be  hence my confusion when the outcome of this episode seemed to be that he had admitted that yes he was a son of rickard karstark and they were in karhold being that his statement was something of you forgot to ask one question you forgot to ask if im a liar he then goes on to say something like everything i told you is a lie this is not happening to you for any reason but that i enjoy it my confusion being that he did not confirm that he had also lied that he was a karstarkmaybe that was implied with the everying i told you is a lie i dont know but the impression that i came away from this episode with was that he is a karstark guess ill find out for sure in a couple of hours anyway maybe "

"8" "ntofr1" 2013-05-12 " not long now "
"9" "crehane" 2013-05-12 " thenorthremembers  nice analysis and it leaves only karhold and the dreadfort as the two options im pretty confident that the boy was lying about everything when he said he was lord karstarks son and that if theon guessed where they were he would stop torturing him that leaves only the dreadfort and his being that character all the clues are there he gets called a bastard a couple of times the torture chamber is set up for flaying the horn playing outside winterfell and again here remember when the news came that theon had seized winterfell roose bolton offered to send his relative to relieve it im also pretty sure that we may have seen a glimpse of a bolton banner in the background behind theon a couple of episodes back i could be wrong though i think were probably going to find out in tonights episode "

"11" "crehane" 2013-05-12 " acertainbang  this explanation of how ros ended up being rumbled and paying the ultimate price is spot on most succinctly put varys tells olenna tyrell that littlefinger is planning on smuggling sansa out to freedom he points out that if robb stark is defeatedkilled then she is the key to the north as such marrying her to ser loras and margaery to joffrey would give the tyrells a serious controlling stake in westeros highgarden in the south winterfell in the north and a queen on the throne in kings landing littlefinger discovers that his plan has been foiled by the tyrells so therefore informs cerseithe lannisters in order to foil there plans and curry favour with tywin as such he now gets harrenhal and the eryie remember as varys put it hed gladly burn it all to the ground if he could be king of the ashes "

"17" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-05-12 " willowight  you are being tortured for what you have done to the north  does this suggest that the torturer is more than likely a northern man but from what house and where might theon be being held there seem to four options apart from winterfell and the sigil for each house seems relevant karhold is the seat of house karstark in the north it is a strong castle and lies in the far east of the north hbo tells us that the castle was built by karlon stark younger son of the then king of the north and the founder of the karstarks on lands confiscated from house bolton of the dreadfort and called karl’s hold their sigil is a white sunburst on black the dreadfort is also in the eastern half of the north and is the seat of house bolton in the north the boltons keep torture chambers there and a special room where they hang the flayed skins of enemies including several kings of house stark before they were defeated by them and became their vassals not a spoiler book 1 centuries ago the boltons rose up against king karlon stark and the dreadfort held out for two years under siege before the boltons surrendered series 2 garden of bones episode told us that its practice was to flay enemies alive ned stark outlawed this practice but it was implied that the boltons continue this in secret roose bolton in my family they say a naked man has few secrets a flayed man has none their sigil is a red faceless flayed man upside down on an xshaped white cross last hearth is the seat of house umber headed by the greatjon clive mantle series 1 in the north and is the northernmost major castle of the seven kingdoms south of the wall last hearth is administered by joint castellans the greatjons uncles who earlier series 2 the north remembers requested assistance from bran stark when he was left in charge at winterfell because they lacked the manpower to harvest their land and repel encroaching wildlings maester luwin reminded bran that listening to people was part of his job house umbers sigil is four chains linked by a central ring deepwood motte is a wooden fortress on a hill and the seat of house glover galbart glover is the master of deepwood motte and series 1 pointy end it is decided he will lead rob stark’s vanguard deepwood motte lies northwest of winterfell deep within the wolfswood and is currently under the control of yara greyjoy theon’s older sister who captured it from glover’s house in season 2 house glover’s sigil is a mailed silver fist on a scarlet background it seems to me that deepwood motte and last hearth cannot be where theon is "

"19" "willowight" 2013-05-11 " which in my mind was the same character that all the clues have been pointing to since this nightmare began for theon the sad part is whether he is who i thought or whether he is rickards son i already like him one of the few people from the books who comes across as a pure psychopath along with the mountain and vargo hoat terrified me in the book i really didnt want to like theons captor "

"50" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-05-10 " lordtubbington  so you are overthinking this haha i dont think so but arent we all puzzled by the intrigues in got many thanks by the way to lord tubbington love that cat avatar a certain bang and mroneill i found your responses really enlightening and agree with almost all that was said in outline incorporating contributions it seems this is the sequence 1 ros told varys about lf’s plot to spirit sansa away with him to the eyrie by pointing out that lf’s cabin on the ship was to have two beds 2 varys tells the lannisters that lf was taking their captive sansa away from kings landing no this seems unlikely the lannisters cant know there is an escape plot involving lf and sansa  if they did tywin might just kill lf as his ambitions are clearly dangerous if he had been found out plotting to steal the heiress of the north from under tywins nose he would hardly be left free to chat with varys at all as much as varys fears lfs ambition he probably fears even more the lannisters and their plan to dominate every kingdom in westeros and the prospect of another mad king getting loose when tywin dies  so he has no motivation to tell the lannisters of lfs plans which he is probably cunning enough to foil himself anyway so scrap 2 3 lf is confronted by the lannisters so he tells them by the way guys the tyrells are planning to marry sansa to loras no the lannisters found out about the sansa and loras plan from their own sources cersei was suspicious of themnot necessarily from varys or lf or varys is quite capable of informing tywin of the plan to marry sansa to loras without needing to bring ross information about lfs designs into it at all the tyrellsansa assignations after all take place in broad daylight in the palace gardens where i think as olenna herself points out there is probably one of varyss little birds in every bush alternatively varys and olenna conspired to keep sansa away from lf but lf discovered this new match after loras rumble with the squire lf’s informant he then informed cersei of the tyrell intentions which was the first the lannisters knew of any scheme involving sansa lf also found out about ros snitching through one of his spies ros is not his only spy another one of his tarts may have informed on her or not being quite as bright as she should be to play such a dangerous game she may have given herself away shae one should also not assume that shae is the whore with a heart of gold that she was presented as in s02  she is above all a born survivor whose only protector tyrion cant even admit that he has any relationship with her at all without her suffering an unpleasant end  she may well have already established her own connections with varys lf or indeed the other lannisters tywin or cersei do not need to know that she has any connection with tyrion to find sansas maid a useful informant she also has had contact with cersei in the blackwater episode and may even be working directly for her as presumably all the maids are officially part of the queens household if anyone has a motivation to sabotage sansas options with both lf and loras it’s her shaes future is based on two relationships as tyrions secret mistress and as sansas maid if sansa either escapes with lf or goes to highgarden with big gay l shae has to choose which relationship to lose but she almost certainly can see lf as the dangerous nihilistic psychotic he is and she was there when ros warned sansa about him as for highgarden removed from tyrion shed just be a surplus ladys maid in a palace full of better born and more competent ones so scrap 3 too 4 lf now tells varys that he has caught ros out as varys informant and so he gives her to joffreyat no point were varys or littlefinger impicated in any schemes although both are guilty so keeping quiet for mutual benefit excellent contributions folks but more to follow though about shae  "

"67" "LordTubbington" 2013-05-09 " thenorthremembers  there is no reason why the lannisters need to know about the plot to spirit awayabduct because lfs motives are hardly pure sansa at all indeed due to her most likely future plotline although they are now changing quite a lot from the books they cant know there is an escape plot involving lf and sansa  and if they did tywin would just order lf to get on with his mission to the eyrie or indeed kill him as his ambitions are clearly dangerous  which again cant happen plotwise the plan to marry cersei rather than sansa to loras and tyrion in sansa actually makes perfect sense for the lannisters anyway as they get effective control of two more kingdoms the north and highgarden  loras and everyone in his family other than his sister and granny being weaklings as opposed to the tyrrells adding the north to their domains and although sansa may not be the brightest stark tywin knows she has real reasons to hate the lannisters and may thus be a potential threat married to a weakling like loras  whereas married to tyrion she will under the thumb of the son he knows to be the cleverest of his children however much he detests him it also solves perfectly tywins what to do with cersei and tyrion problem he knows that she is a bad or just not much of any influence on joffrey and also wants her gone from kings landing before jaime returns as he clearly has a hangup about his children shagging each other  but she is quite capable of dominating a loras tyrion he clearly just cant bear to look at unsurprisingly given that his being born at all killed the only love of his life and will not under any circumstances allow the dwarf to inherit his own lands  but knows he is clever enough to win and rule the north in the lannister interest and joffrey doesnt need to know what ros did at all and indeed cant know as a future plotline depends on sansa not being followed around at all times by a detachment of guards to torture her to death just for fun as for varys however much he fears lfs ambition he probably fears the lannisters and their plan to dominate every kingdom in westeros and the prospect of another mad king getting loose when tywin dies even more  so he has no motivation whatsoever to tell the lannisters of lfs plans which he is probably cunning enough to foil himself anyway the loose end is therefore how lf learned of ross betrayal at all  he may have surmised that the lannister change of plans was prompted by varys  but if he had been found out plotting to steal the heiress of the north from under tywins nose he would hardly be left free to chat with varys at all but ros is not his only spy and another one of his tarts may have informed on her and presumably ros doesnt wander the docks without a servant or bodyguard in tow  or not being quite as bright as she should be to play such a dangerous game she may have given herself away in one of their little talks so you are overthinking this "
"68" "LordTubbington" 2013-05-09 " johndear  have they cast a red viper yet i am at least halfconvinced that they may give his big scene in s04 to bronn as otherwise he will have nothing else to do and if they did they can avoid finding yet another set of locations dorne being the westeros equivalent of medieval spain and eliminate the whole dornish plotline which occupies far too many chapters of the last two books to no purpose whatsoever if they choose to gallop through and wrap up everything in six seasons which there are good economic reasons to do i can well see this happening  however if they do drag it out into a 7th or 8th they may need the dornish filler "
"69" "LordTubbington" 2013-05-09 " chillingworth really dont think that emilia clarke is the ideal dany at all  however it was going to be tamsin merchant who i just cant imagine in the role at all also not sure about iain glen who is a fine actor but just doesnt have any sexual chemistry with emilia at all but is supposed to be utterly besotted with her  although this may be more down to her than him loras is also not turning out well  although i think thats the writers camping him up being gay does not mean that you cant be the best knight in westeros rather than the actorthe ashayara actor also just isnt physically credible as a woman who can command an army of misogynistic barbarian males by being able to outfight outsail outride outdrink and outswear any of them  they really needed a more lucy lawless character but in such a big cast thats going incredibly well "
"70" "LordTubbington" 2013-05-09 " edwardelric  no  while the book series will never get finished at all the tv series is unlikely be more than 7 or 8 seasons and may be as few as 6 most of the core original cast seem to have been contracted for 6 seasons and several of them dinklage in particular will be in a very strong position to demand a lot more money if it drags on into 78 and the current book will just about take them into about the middle of season 4 after which there are two very long volumes where nothing very much actually happens for 2000 pages other than people wandering around slowly and describing everything they see in excruciating detail i really cant see those providing enough plot for more than a half season so that then gives them seasons 5 and 6 to finish off the whole saga leading up some gigantic battle between dragons and ice zombies in the ruins of harrenhall not a spoiler as that book hasnt been written yet and probably never will be  but i am willing to bet any reasonable amount that that is how it will end "
"71" "LordTubbington" 2013-05-09 " johnnyg79  but wrong you are and i have indeed read many better books many of which are leather bound plus anyone with any pretensions to culture at all knows that the better the book the harder it is to adapt satisfactorily to the screen how many mediocre adaptations have there been of war and peace and anna karenina frex while some very poor books indeed have been adapted into great movies and tv shows "
"72" "LordTubbington" 2013-05-09 " johnnyg79  you probably wont say that after the next episode but one its a slow build just because there are so many character arcs to keep going simultaneously and one or two have been dropped or delayed  weve not seen anything of theons sister and some biggish stuff that will happen in the iron isles yet  but that wont probably happen until next season but due to stuff that will happen before the end of this season the writers have rather fewer balls that they have to keep juggling so s04 should just zip along by comparison "
"73" "LordTubbington" 2013-05-09 " sinequanone  finding badass stuff for bronn to do is indeed a bit of a challenge for the writers as long as he is tyrions bodyguard in kings landing and nobody is trying to kill him difficult to say more without spoilers from the books  although i suspect precisely because tvbronn is such a badass his character arc may diverge a great deal from bookbronn "
"74" "LordTubbington" 2013-05-09 " ciwstudent  forgot that  the problem with obsessive compulsively reading all the books in order is that the endless meandering tedious nothingness of the last two tends to drive some of the details of the first three from your memory but he certainly doesnt own the greatest little whorehouse in westeros and command a whole army of prostitutes and catamites overall i think they were driven by the dramatic need to provide varys with a foil  indeed a negative reflection of varys who is motivated not by a real if carefully hidden and somewhat ruthless utilitarian humanitarianism but by pure nihilistic ambition and who very unlike poor varys uses sex to get his way oh and by the need to have as much tits and ass in the show as possible although they do seem to have toned that down somewhat this season once it became clear that teenage boys would continue watching even without a nude scene every ten minutes  and is it just me or is there less swearing as well  dont think anyone has dropped a cbomb yet for instance  and how better to achieve that than to have a major character seemingly actually live in a brothel "
"75" "MRONeill" 2013-05-09 " thenorthremembers  i think lf found out about ros and varys through one of his spies i got the impression that the lannisters found out about sansa and loras by their own sources remember cersei was suspicious of themnot necessarily varys or lf i think this because per your point i wouldnt think the lannisters would let either varys or littlefinger off the hook for plotting to either arrange sansas marriage to loras or steal her this is one of those moments where its important to keep in mind that varys has spies everywhere as do lf cersei tyrion and presumably tywin and joffery even in the book a lot of the secrets that get out we dont know the source beyond my little spiders or spies "

"143" "Dewulf" 2013-05-08 " napalmfacewipes  yup did you hear the comments from theons captor about him being a better hunter and the stark boys would be an interesting hunt given we know roose sent his bastard to take back winterfell and robb issued a command that if theon was handed over then the iron islanders could leave freely and if you had a bastard in that time period would you perhaps not have him in your own house but maybe in a vassal house and weve seen at least one vassal house of boltons getting up to some pretty hard core stuff plus bit of a long shot bolton said hed sent his best hunter after jaime add all of that to bolton trying to avoid the lannisters bad books whilst potentially making enemies with robb if he finds out roose sent the kingslayer home the implication is roose has figured that robbs going to lose the war and is hedging his bets if not outright planning to change sides a wild random guess on my part about that is certain doom for the starks will be averted by a greater threat taking up their enemys attentions perhaps dany and the unsullied whilst the northerners get to grips with the wildlings and the white walkers cant believe theres only four episodes to go im guessing we may not even get that far "

"152" "Dewulf" 2013-05-08 " silgen  hmm i havent read the books but whilst dany used the pyre to a cremate drogo b heat up the eggs and c execute the priestess i didnt think that there was a definite causal relationship between the other two and heating the eggs she says later that she dreamt they would hatch if she put them in fire which doesnt sound like blood magic to me further blood magic is something the priestess knew through training which dany never had i think more likely it was simply the extreme heat of the pyre and perhaps that she was there for them as the last dragon from the house targaryen it was just a coincidence that she used the pyre that said im sure she did want to use her husbands funeral to execute the person responsible for his death "

"386" "Moophasa" 2013-05-07 " i liked it the death of ros was a very powerful ending it felt a bit like the writers getting their own back on people who hated her character for not being in the books and if that was part of their motivation probably not it certainly worked it worked well to show just how evil joffrey is  in the books he shoots peasants with his crossbow and mutilated a pregnant cat this way was more shocking probably the placement of the arrows in her body was also a clear reference to arya earlier in the episode when she was practicing archery at the time it didnt seem too troubling but then at the end of the episode we see what happens when you actually kill somebody readers of the books will know that aryas storyline took a very dark turn shortly after leaving kings landing with yoren and a lot of the grim details were omitted in the tv show they need to ramp up her darkness level for where her character is going to be later in the series "

"797" "Mirthin" 2013-05-06 " londonstillrocks  i quite like the way they combined gendry and edric storm edric is one of the novels least memorable characters and gendry one of the rare likable ones that fades away too quickly the characters are similar enough that theres not much point to dramatizing both and i bet grrm would have made this change himself if he could go back and rewrite his novels going forward it will be interesting seeing how gendrys relationship with stannis daughter mirrors his relationship with arya having melisandre and thoros together was also quite interesting melisandre said that thoros was on a mission from rhollor to convert king robert and of course we know melisandre was on a similar mission to convert stannis it seems the lord of light was determined to convert the baratheons intriguingly its also hinted in the books that littlefinger has ancestral ties to the lord of light geographically the riverlands are quite close to dragonstone im looking at the map right now geek alert i own the lands of ice and fire map set you can take a ship west from dragonstone right up the bay of crabs into the heart of the riverlands the war is currently at an impasse and the riverlands relatively calm since tywins army hunkered down in kings landing and the stark horde split between riverrun and harrenhal the mountain does lead a small army of raiders through the riverlands but they have been pushed out west by edmure tully the infamous victory at the mill melisandres visions have already proven accurate several times ie the poisoned goblet the death of davos son and stannis loss at kings landing no reason she couldnt see gendry in her fires too maybe she already knew about him roberts bastards were the worst kept secret in kings landing and melisandres clearly been close to the baratheons for some time i do agree that littlefinger is painted too broadly in the tv show hes had evil villain practically tattooed across his forehead since his first appearance in season 1 in the books hes much more of a charming scoundrel wheres the man who the tully girls all found irresistible "
"798" "Cariad007" 2013-05-06 " im not sure cersei has thought through the whole marriage to loras thing i mean its not ideal but hed hardly be a demanding husband would he she might have to pop out one kid but after that im sure they could reach some sort of agreement where each discreetly sought their pleasures with someone they actually fancied and loras isnt exactly bright  im sure she could use her natural cunning to manipulate him on the other hand marriage to him would mean that her father still controlled her "
"799" "MZorin" 2013-05-06 " is melisandre going to use gendry as a stud to churn out shadow baby assassins poor poor gendry "
"800" "ntofr1" 2013-05-06 " ntofr1  sorry delete pls "
"801" "ntofr1" 2013-05-06 " phil aylward  your comment implied that you lost respect for diana rigg because you see her character as pushing some liberal agenda for the network "
"802" "seeknsanity" 2013-05-06 " sydneysider28  another funny scene edmures face as the freys ambled up the stairs while they were leaving the room i could see him imagining what his proposed bride would look like "
"803" "Andrew Scott Buddendeck" 2013-05-06 " ygritte reaaalllllllly liked what jon snow did in that cave looks like he know one thing at least "
"804" "seeknsanity" 2013-05-06 " londonstillrocks  good points i find that i am beginning to look for less and less comparison between the books and the show for favor of simply viewing the show as its own similar to a spinoff of a sorts from the books "
"805" "ntofr1" 2013-05-06 " seeknsanity  thanks for the review ill stop dragging my heels and order it "
"806" "seeknsanity" 2013-05-06 " deletethispost  what i realized from the credits for last week and the scene with shireen is that what she is singing are actually the lines that her fool repeats in the book am i allowed to say that since they didnt include the fool in the show "
"807" "RivendellElrond" 2013-05-06 " a strong episode particularly with the character driven quieter scenes it may have suffered following 2 excellent episodes but with many high points loved seeing brienne in a dress i have looked forward to the wall climbing since the start of the show and it didnt disappoint  jon and ygritte can have their moment of triumph literally and metaphorically i too have had problems with littlefinger and varys scenes not coming across quite as well as the books but the ending sequence with the voice over was spot on a lot of story in a short space rather like last weeks episode diana rigg and charles dance outstanding as always joffrey not as understanding with the ladies as podrick and jon snow do we have to wait another whole week "
"808" "seeknsanity" 2013-05-06 " ntofr1  city of theives yes very good book gory cannibal scenes read it a few years back after reading child 44 and looking for similar books i dont think youll be disappointed "
"809" "seeknsanity" 2013-05-06 " opinionatedfrog  i sat up in my chair during the scene between oleena and tywin it was so good i then stayed that way until he credits began rolling which to me seems to be five minutes too soonoh the varys and littlefinger scene was dark and cunning and exciting at the same time these two real powers of the kingdom which will win which will win "

"811" "sydneysider28" 2013-05-06 " i thought there were some very good comedy moments in this ep  amidst all the darkness at the end anyway i had a few laughoutloud moments roose bolton has a sense of humour and the lorassansa scene is very funny but best of all was the qot discussing loras and his proclivities with an increasingly distasteful tywinanyway im sure she has her schemes and she wont let tywin get the best of heri am not sure what the point of the ros thing was  perhaps littlefinger wanted to show to varys he could get the better of him always  although i think varys has got a lot of irons in the fire and maybe the writers thought that joffrey hasnt had enough chances to be mad and bad as usual this seasoni am feeling a bit afraid for gendry i hope they dont have him killed offtyrions well this is awkward was quite funny too im glad we didnt see her reaction at the time finally im glad that ygritte has stopped saying her catchphrase  for now at least "
"812" "ntofr1" 2013-05-06 " londonstillrocks  im in two minds as to wether i agree that melisandre being in the riverlands is a problem though she came from dragonstone not storms end i agree with point c but i think a and b can be explained however unsatisfactory that might be i also think there was a purpose to ros death do you really think that littlefinger would let varys off for using ros to spy on him "
"813" "DiamondDag" 2013-05-06 " bit of a limp episode after the quality of the last two i thought i think they could do with taking some time away from kings landing with all thats going on at the wall it would be nice have an episode that delves into that a bit more and puts kings landing into the background a bit maybe thats going to be the focus later on have to see not that i havent enjoyed all the interplay and machinations but after another scene with tywin sat at a table and the queen of thorns being a smart arse id like a change of pace "
"814" "MRONeill" 2013-05-06 " deletethispost  i love how you broke down varysned speech re power and varyslittlefinger re chaosnicely put i think this is also quite a succinct summary of the series as a whole as well as sarahs point regarding if you think this has a happy ending re tywinqot  that was littlefinger sailing away at the end not loras i had to rewind it to be sure but littlefingers sigil that he made up himself is the mockingbird and was on the sail in that scene presumably loras is staying in kings landing to wed and bed the elderly cersei and attempt to capitalize on what remains of her eggs "
"815" "jackman" 2013-05-06 " cosmonaut  i thought that  especially when i saw the banner behind roose bolton  someone on an xshaped cross and house bolton likes to flay their victims so i would guess something to roose but not quite as simple as that "
"816" "ntofr1" 2013-05-06 " cosmonaut  theres a glimpse of yunkai in the preview for next weeks episode "

"819" "ntofr1" 2013-05-06 " moretears  benioff wrote a novel set during the siege of stalingrad that i keep meaning to get its supposedly very good anyone read it "
"820" "ntofr1" 2013-05-06 " there are so few characters in control of their own destiny right now tywin appears to have gotten what he wants and melisandre seems to have gotten something she wants everybody else however seems to be desperately clinging to whatever rung of the ladder theyve been stalled at waving around in vain for the next one not since littlefinger sold out ned have we seen his raw ruthlessness lets hope he never hears what bronn called him i found the oneupmanship between lf and varys a bit like pantomime at first i thwarted you then i thwarted you hes behind you but then the way that scene built up was unexpected and had me totally transfixed might just be me but i kept thinking about biblicalchristian references in this episode littlefingers metaphor made me think of jacobs ladder and ros brutal death made me think of saint sebastian whether theres anything more to that i couldnt say loving the family rivalry between edmure and bryndon the law of my fist is about to compel your teethtully they are still holding off from just out right telling us who theons unnerving and nightmarish tormentor is im thinking the horn he blew to wake our troubled iron man is another clue if one thinks back to when theon held winterfell and the incessant horn blowing from whoever surrounded the walls those freys looked about as trustworthy and sincere as walder is reputed to be not very but perhaps they are just wary of being crossed again  and whispering roose is trying to curry favour with tywin by allowing jaime to continue to kings landing not looking good for robb "
"821" "MichaelKorleone" 2013-05-06 " i kept refreshing this page for past couple of hrs hoping sarah would have posted her reviews finally a scene between oleanna and tywin both looked badass and did live up to our expectations sad to see ros die but what a brilliant dialogue between littlefinger and varys "
"822" "londonstillrocks" 2013-05-06 " this was a tough episode for anyone whos familiar with the books seemed to have some of the biggest changes and for the least logical reasons melisandre in the riverlands made very little sense at all by not introducing a minor character earlier edric storm and in general downplaying the idea that robert had multiple bastards they got themselves in a bind which has required them to create a very unconvincing and overly complicated situation where a melisandre apparently travels from storms end to the riverlands through the most war torn area of the country with a total of three guards unmolestedb somehow mystically know about gendry in the first place andc significantly undermine the concept of the brotherhood by their simply selling gendry into slavery i actually thought this episode confirmed to me that littlefinger is the most poorly acted andor written character theres no real purpose for what he does with ros and it just makes him one among a bunch of other vicious characters rather than being the onthesurface frivolous scheming and uncaring without being deliberately cruel for crueltys sake individual the books i think the tv version of the character is poorer for that "
"823" "Sunburst" 2013-05-06 " our god is the one true god oh dear oh dear oh dear anyway a painfully slow soap opera rapidly devolving into painfully slow torture porn at least theres peter dinklage charles dance and diana rigg thats the only reason why i keep wasting my time on it "

"840" "DeleteThisPost" 2013-05-06 " oh poor sansa i dont imagine that even the sansahaters can fail to feel some sympathy for the girl i did enjoy the scene between tyrion and cersei as the anonymonity between the two was somewhat put aside as they both had misery to share and i was somewhat surprised to learn that it was joffrey and not cersei who was responsible for the attempt on tyrions life and poor ros to die at the hands of a psycho is one thing but to die at the hands of an incompetent psycho i would hope that the shot to the heart had been joffreys first but little chance of that the poor girl had seven bolts stuck in her and i counted at least seven that completely missed i admit to being a bit confused for when the queen of thornes was dealing with tywin i thought for a while that she was playing him for a fool i thought that she actually wanted loras named to the kings guard and had goaded him perfectly into doing her bidding but when she broke his quill and when loras was apparently sailing back to highgarden i found that i comletely misunderstood that scene high valyrian is officially my favorite invented language damn it sounds cool and melisandre and thoros speak it just as well as dany which is as much a testament to the creator of the language as the actors who have to say it on camera i enjoyed the speech littlefinger gave to varys but it reminded me of a line varys spoke to ned stark varys had told ned that power is an illusion whereas littlefinger told varys that pretty much everything everything except chaos is an illusion in essense order is an illusion only chaos is real and i was also reminded of a scene between varys and ros im afraid of him she said oh you should be was varys reply spoilerishtoo bad theon didnt know the answer to those questions if he had and if he had been in the mood for levity he could have rightly said that there was only one answer to both but for those who havent ruined things for themselves by going on imdb to see the character name of his tormentor ill refrain from giving that precise answer here except to writeyoure a  and youre torturing me because youre a  "
