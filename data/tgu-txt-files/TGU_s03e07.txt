"8" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-05-19 " moreisless  declaring a king in the north was always a strategic mistake and they would have been better served aligning with renly that would have left the lannisters with no allies and there for the taking  but surely with ned declaring for stannis how could robb and the north then declare for his younger brother renly did had a lot to answer for but of course his wife margaery said at the time that she wanted to be the queen so i guess she was behind renlys commitment to oppose stannis and go for the throne himself after roberts death its a superb irony that if melisandre had not brought about renlys death by shadow creature then the tyrrell forces would not currently be aligned to tywins so paradoxically it was stannis that lost out by the actions of his red priestess i see that key predictions that she made in the books with a leech have not been featured in the tv series  maybe its felt that she is just too unreliable "

"624" "5432Hun" 2013-05-14 " acertainbang  great summary and yet i dont feel this is what is coming across in the show theons torturer seems to be enjoying the torture for tortures sake not for the higher purpose of deconstructing theons flaws theons torturer is enjoying the the torture for its own sake whoever he is and whatever his motivations which still seem to be ambiguous to some viewers so well leave that there we can safely say he is a 24 carat sadist its grrm and the writers etc who are visting the punishment on theon for his hubris ser rodrik and maester lewin both told him to pull back or he would be lostdamned but he plunged i wouldnt say he doesnt deserve it but it does seem a little bit unfair when so many other characters appear to get away with being complete bastards all the time "
"625" "RandyLeahy" 2013-05-14 " sharpmango  stop watching then or go stand outside hbos head office holding your little plaque the scene was brilliant it was horrific the way the two girls were filmed just made me queasy we all knew the torturer guy would break in at some point i dont want my tv censored a 14 yr old may have found it erotic but i assume an adult could pick up on the threatening undertones get over it move on "

"627" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-05-14 " mroneill  i got the feeling that margery is quite experienced in all things  pretty girls boys life that thing jon snow did with his tongue yes that was a puzzle as tywin thinks joff should take her maidenhead  knowing that renly swung the other way  but joff may get a rude surprise unless margaery has hitherto confined herself to the shrimp thing  or girls as sarah tentatively suggests "
"628" "frenegonde" 2013-05-14 " dryhtscipe  it was easily to recall his uncaring and unthinking use of that girl aboard ship who naively saw him as a potential route out while he saw her as a place to put his cock perhaps but if every man whod ever had sex with a woman simply for his own gratification was punished like that imagine the carnage we could also say she wanted to use him  as an escape who is wrong in a relationship like that "
"629" "Pepa01" 2013-05-14 " the scene with theon was the nearest ive come to being genuinely repulsed by this show the scene with theron is completely useless to the plot it does not give any information about him or his captor it has been introduced as an excuse to show violence and naked woman the hole theon story does not make sense since his torturer is obviously not looking for information so what a psicoi love this show but they abuse on naked women and violence to mantain the climax which by the way is a poor resource and yes i said naked women and no nudity we have hardly seen two or three man asses and no man completely naked while seeing woman naked for free is starting to get booring besides than annoying see the difference between robb and his wife or ygritte and jon snow i think there are four female characters that we have not seen naked yet "

"633" "weewilkie" 2013-05-14 " you know i think game of thrones nicked its central premise from marty debergis great unmade masterpiece kramer vs kramer vs godzilla  "
"634" "SarahHughes" 2013-05-14 " sinequanone  really you dont think the fact they chopped off the lead characters head in the first season means that generally you cant believe anyones safe its honestly not a spoiler i just think the further we go into this show the more miserably doom ridden it gets  theons being castrated sansas being forcibly married off for her claim to the north robbs gambling everything on an unpleasant old man who as his mother just pointed out wanted the king not the wedding jons about to fight against his brothers alongside a rag tag bunch of wildings who pointed out themselves this week that theyll kill each other if it keeps them alive id say that added up to a whole heap of possible doom or you know maybe im just a glass half empty kind of girl "
"635" "5432Hun" 2013-05-14 " this was one of those episodes where i wish i hadnt read the books 3 times if im honest     i know im a grown man with children as well anyway as a book reader the problem with this episode is that it didnt really achieve a lot other than move some characters closer to where i already know they are heading if i hadnt read the books im guessing i would have felt more of a sense of progression that said the set piece with the bear was well done though i was a little disappointed to see that locke still had both his ears some of the exchanges were as always superbly acted  jack gleason petulant bargaining for significance was really good the dragons looked brilliant the theon torture scenes are probably pushing the audiences tolerance to the limit now not personally offended by them myself  after all this is what torture is but i can see how some feel that its too relentlessly grisly i am loathe to criticise sarah who does a generally excellent job but i really dont think this scene should have been in the nudity count you rightly in my view dont include male on female rape scenes so i dont see how you can justify including a sadistic castration finally a quick word for kristian nairn who delivered his best hodor of the entire show so far just when osha is getting into her ranting stride and she asks him what jojen reed is up to lovely touch "

"638" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-05-14 " kged  then we see melisandre who  having last week gone for a stroll through a continental warzone with a handful of guards  now sails within a bowshot of the palace it is beyond stupid to think that she could have entered the capital walked around the harbour negotiated with captains and found passage on a ship i very much doubt that she entered the capital although she sailed fairly clodse to it melisandre and gendry presumably took a ship down the blackwater rush river into blackwater bay sailing past kings landing and the wrecks from last season and on to dragonstone just outside the bay incidentally dragonstone and stannis appears to be very close to blackwater so wouldnt we expect to hear about a constant series of skirmishes and raiding parties by one side or the other "
"639" "SarahHughes" 2013-05-14 " kged  i was more amused by the nihilism of the death line i agree it wasnt as well done as some of maisies other scenes but i agree this was one of the weakest episodes of this season "

"645" "guardiansek" 2013-05-14 " i liked the episode though i think episodes 4 and 5 from this year are still the strongest 1 great scene with tywin and joffrey i think i want to see tywin take his intimidation road tour to margareys or the nowreforming jaimes door someday 2 like sarah i think that jon and ygritte are finally taking off after one and a half seasons of sulking north of the wall or being browbeaten by ygritte jon and ygritte have a real relationship also have to agree that any people struck dumb by an abandoned windmill are not going to do so well against a trained and equipped army 3 theon continues to pay the price for his bad decisions id feel sorry for the guy but hey he did string up two orphans last season in one of his many vain attempts to win his scornful fathers respectso i cant complain much 4 i thought this weeks arya moment was not her best well below some of her great scenes from earlier this season and last season but then the girls been through a lot shes lost her real and adhoc families and shes surrounded by untrustworthy types 5 best moments this week go to jaime and his attempts to fly his honor flag after hiding it for so long i guess the trueblue brianne was the catalyst he needed to rediscover what he had lost if he keeps this up its going to be interesting to see how he relates to his grasping dad and his amoral sister now "

"684" "PrinceOfPentos" 2013-05-14 " subtle 21st century misandry dislike of contempt for or ingrained prejudice against men in this episode 1 gendry stating that he never wanted a father this is a reflection of the typical 21st century notions that fathers are failing their children rather than being banished from their childrens lives through court gender discrimination against men and their former partners socially accepted vindictive attitudes and that a family consisting of only a mother and her children is ideal rather than being a cause for increased criminality among youth due to failed parenthood 2 ygrittes verbal and physical abuse towards jon this is another reflection of the typical 21st century notion that violence whether physical or verbal by women against men is always justified because supposedly the womans desire to cause violence and abuse is only the result of even worse abuse by the man this stands in blind contradiction to the reality whereby often women abusers are the first and only to attack and without valid reason and for imagined causes ex he deserved it believing themselves to be entitled and justified in their unreciprocated violence against men through mainstream social acceptance and congratulation of it especially in entertainment media for instance around 40 of domestic violence victims are men abuse is abuse female abuse against men is a crime punishable by law 3 theons erotic castration 21st century notion that men do not have reproductive rights that male bodies are disposable and yet contradictorily that they cannot be victims as only female bodies can be victims and that men are incapable of being raped as they are always desirous of sex these are the above nonsense ideas men do have reproductive rights their bodies are just as precious as female ones and should not be placed unnecessarily in harms way men can also be victims not just women and men can also be raped as theon was in the episode by both the women and the unnamed man 4 margarys lecture about the complicated nature of women indirectly she is stating a 21st notion that men are bart simpsonstyle sexual simpleton testosterone animals not difficult to please sexually and not needing of much love and emotion this is of course complete bullshit and the polar opposite is often true "

"732" "angelamarica" 2013-05-13 " i have to agree about theons story line in the series the torture comes out after the events in drips in the books and even that made me a bit squeamish the problem with the series is that theyve missed out a lot of details and changed some of the sequence of events thus making less sense with some characters motivations the series sometimes seems a little disjointed without knowing more about these peoples inner workings some scenes are trivialised by this for instance arya and gendry went through some far more horrific stuff in the originals up to this point catelyns emotional state husbands death followed by beloved fathers death loss and perceived death of children worry for oldest son and consequent actions make far more sense in the books the torture porn with theon annoys me when they baulked at showing some of the more horrific sides of war thus causing arya to become brutalised and mistrusting im not sure what happens to sansas acting in her scenes with margaery but it always seems offkey at these moments she doesnt take a good profile shot either im enjoying this series but i dont feel it does the events it portrays real justice only drawing me half in if the casting wasnt so good i fear it would fall a great deal flatter but really having reread up to this point what were they thinking with renley and loras i was expecting screen gods no charisma and not even good looking that renleys ghost would never have bothered to come back sansa should thank her lucky stars she is marrying tyrion and not that flowery weed and for whichever gods sake get the onion knight out of that dungeon he is stannis conscience and strategist also danaerys purge of some cities is justified in the books these places are hotbeds of vice exploitation and cruelty and those who got rich off the back of slaves need a bit of sterilising with dragon fire what wed all do with three dragons imagine westminster in flames remember she jon snow and robb stark are all very young and elevated beyond their years at present so as they like to say in the xfactor they are all on a journey for better or worse theirs is a game of teens at present "
"733" "davidjones2492" 2013-05-13 " idil  i think it is very difficult to portray sansas growing maturity on the show because were not privy to her thoughts as we are in the novels her main method of protecting herself is to behave as a suplicant and play dumb when shes doing this on the show we dont know whats shes really thinking and shes more likely to come across as dumb rather than cautious also shes gone from being a very protected child with notions of romanticism to being almost entirely isolated while shes come to learn about lannister brutality on a regular basis she has had far less of a chance to see political manouevering close up she has only had limited opportunities to learn "

"1063" "Idil" 2013-05-13 " sansas naive and unrealistic disney princess type of notions of love and life is annoying me more and more in comparison to m tyrell she is so cluelessi blame catelyn stark for her predicament she was the one closer to her bran is younger but he has a far deeper understanding of life i have totally forgiven theon after witnessing the pain and torture he has been afflicted with i am feeling sorry for him despite his past crimes tywin was impressive as always joffrey had at least the sense to be afraid of his grandfather he is a force to be reckoned with i am loving jamie more and more with brienne he is finding the good and nice version of himself unlike when he was with cersei tyrion jon snow were adorable as always i wonder what melissandre plans to do with gendry i guess she would not have told him about his father if she was planning to kill him will he be the stallion for future shadow children danerys is becoming more and more of a queen every day still i am frightened of tywin than danerys i miss my onion knight "
"1064" "MRONeill" 2013-05-13 " dickvandyke  sarahhughes  excellent points regarding tywin and joffery i was so distracted marveling at the excellent acting im not sure i put together that joffery was indeed correct  he should be involved in the decisions for his kingdom sociopath or not rightful heir or not he is on the iron throne as pointed out previously tywins biggest flaw is that he cannot see tyrion for the intelligent and very useful member of his family he is while joffery is neither intelligent or useful if intelligent his baser instincts overrule this more often than not  its feasible he could be both if given the right guidance by tywin a challenge i believe hes told cersei hes up to surely tywin cares about his familys legacy if nothing else  there will come a time where tywin gets old and joffery grows up  one would think tywin would have the foresight to plan accordingly and teach him the game as he plays it "
"1065" "Steve Cook" 2013-05-13 " xandrammes  good job im not shamed by my ignorance most of my understanding of the american revolutionary period comes from assassins creed 3 "
"1066" "SarahHughes" 2013-05-13 " hippocampus  no no it hasnt  i know its not normally on this site right now theres been a mixup were sorting it out and im adding the spoiler warning "
"1067" "Xandrammes" 2013-05-13 " steve cook  weve been calling her daenerys spartacus targaryen in our house btw the real lincoln was not a particularly nice man he refused to accept the equality of black people with whites and after abolishing slavery he planned to ship all black people out of america it was people like frances dana barker gage elizabeth cady stanton susan b anthony and thaddeus stevens who were the true progressives of their era in that they argued not only in favour of abolition but also for universal suffrage "
"1068" "singist" 2013-05-13 " kevinscully  yes i totally did "
"1069" "Hippocampus" 2013-05-13 " and i havent bothered to read the previous comments which contain the answer apologies aah naw nuthin jon snoooaaaaawwwww "
"1070" "Frances56" 2013-05-13 " i really thought jaime was going to push locke into the bear pit pushing is his specialty you know bearded jaime  good jaimeshaved face jaime  bad jaimebut will he keep the beard  hodor looks entranced in deep thoughtthen he speaks hodor  "
"1071" "Hippocampus" 2013-05-13 " massively confused has this been shown on sky atlantic yet the last one i saw ended when jon and ygritte got to the top of the wall and looked south at the green vista can someone confirm before i read this and spoiler myself to death "
"1072" "SarahHughes" 2013-05-13 " groovereers  yes it always goes up between the us and uk editions but this is missing the spoiler warning  im going to get it sorted out sorry "
"1073" "Steve Cook" 2013-05-13 " anonnyscouse  time to advertise my ignorance here but from what little historical fiction ive read genghis would turn up outside someones gaff and suggest they had about as long as it took him to change from a black yurt to a white one to surrender the city or else bad things would happenthats the general theme anyway details probably a bit awry "
"1074" "singist" 2013-05-13 " morrigu  he certainly knows how to blow his own trumpet "
"1075" "kevinscully" 2013-05-13 " did anyone else get a huge anchorman vibe as jamie leapt into the bear pit i immediately regret this decision "
"1076" "groovereers" 2013-05-13 " confused isnt this a review of the episode screening in te uk later tonight "
"1077" "WeHappyFew" 2013-05-13 " dickvandyke  the torture is far from over later itll become clearer what it adds to the story keep watching "
"1078" "Xandrammes" 2013-05-13 " dickvandyke  i would have been fine with theons scene in this episode if we hadnt already seen him tortured escape only to return and endure further torture the repetitiveness of his ordeals bother me more than the amalgamation of eroticism and torture i have loved charles dance thus far but i would say that tywinjoff was one of the weakest scenes in the episode the smirk after putting joffrey down was a little incongruous tywin is a man irritated and exasperated by his useless progeny  he is not amused by the prospect of disciplining them except with the slight possibility of tyrion its not at all unrealistic that joffrey fears tywin virtually everyone does and hes also his grandfather proud strong powerful people can sometimes end up quailing in the presence of their parents and grandparents this is in addition to the fact that joffrey is a spoiled evil teen who boasts more bravado than he does display true courage "
"1079" "anonnyscouse" 2013-05-13 " steve cook  not sure i know enough about genghis other than he conquered a lot of the world dany like but then was buried in a secret unmarked grave with the people who buried him being killed to keep the secret cant see dany give that order so i guess thats were similarity ends "
"1080" "Mmmrrrggglll" 2013-05-13 " ygritte makes me swoon though i have a bad feeling for the future  "
"1081" "Steve Cook" 2013-05-13 " anonnyscouse  was trying to get across that dany seems to be some kind of weird amalgamation of lincoln and genghis khanbut i couldnt squeeze that into a pithy oneliner "
"1082" "Ryan Brighton" 2013-05-13 " morrigu  indeed giggled like a sociopath throughout that and the torturer has a nifty line in trolling theon at every opportunity "
"1083" "anonnyscouse" 2013-05-13 " steve cook  haha i think westerosi theatre is probably rather dangerous to attend even if youre not a slave freer "
"1084" "anonnyscouse" 2013-05-13 " sezame  yeah a lot was cut out but complainers ignore that and just focus on whats added the main one being the littlefinger scene from season 1 i think the theon scene will be viewed like that one really which is a shame because it will take focus away from how good although unpleasant the scene was "
"1085" "Steve Cook" 2013-05-13 " quick word of warning for dany once youve finished your mission if you fancy taking a break do not try a night out at the theatre this will not end well for youas this is in the guardian i assume i dont have to explain the lincoln reference "
"1086" "dhulmes" 2013-05-13 " i didnt mind the theon bit as much but do wish theyd leave a week between revisiting them it just seems to get a lot of screentime for a storyline that is unlikely to be going anywhere for a while stilli really do think it will payoff bigtime down the road on the whole bit of a low key episode good but not as great as the rest of the season on the other hand thought the jon snow scenes were some of the best so far for actually fleshing out the wildlings from the look of the preview things are about to pick up pace next week "
"1087" "sezame" 2013-05-13 " anonnyscouse  just getting into the books ive noticed the nude stuff is pretty much going on everywhere except at the wall and beyond so far "
"1088" "anonnyscouse" 2013-05-13 " sarahhughes  im not saying it wasnt necessary just that much like you i didnt enjoy it the argument from those who complain about nudity would be that they could tease without showing anything in fact the unnamed character could have just reminded theon of previous conquests to make the point but personally i think it was handled in the best way just very unpleasant "

"1092" "anonnyscouse" 2013-05-13 " dickvandyke  its worth checking out myles mcnutt actually the source of the term sexposition does more like essays than reviews and his view on the theon storyline as a metaphor for other characters plights as well as his own is very interesting "
"1093" "MoreTears" 2013-05-13 " agentscully2006  you are thinking of hyacinth bucket im sure she is someone whom i wouldnt mind seeing pop up in westeros in some capacity the queen of thorns wouldnt even stand a chance "
"1094" "dickvandyke" 2013-05-13 " was the scene with theon really necessary i think we all guessed what was going to happen from the beginning this storyline just seems to be an overly dragged out torture scene that doesnt really add anything to the story the scene with tywin and joffrey was probably the standout part of a slightly boring episode i really want joffrey to get more involved in the small council meetings and the running of the realm despite all joffreys problems hes clearly got a bit of intelligence and with his ego it seems unrealistic that hed just take a back seat "
"1095" "agedpublisher" 2013-05-13 " agentscully2006  whaaaat id definitely scale the wall for a few hours in her harrenhal theres just something about the way she says john snooaaw "
"1096" "morrigu" 2013-05-13 " i find it hard to dislike theons torturer mainly cos hes torturing theon "
"1097" "SarahHughes" 2013-05-13 " singist  ha thanks also i will now no longer be able to think of dany without thinking of in bed with madonna so er thanks for that "
"1098" "SarahHughes" 2013-05-13 " anonnyscouse  yes good point re oshas speech  i should have considered that the theon scene can be argued as necessary in order to demonstrate how theon is being broken down and stripped off his humanity indeed james poniewosik makes just that point in time magazines review of this episode this week its worth checking out but i have to admit it was too strong for me and i have a strong stomach actually seeing theons degradation play out on screen has bothered me far more than reading about it did although the scenes dealing with it in the book are pretty strong stuff too "
"1099" "singist" 2013-05-13 " i love how imperious dany is these days holding court like shes madonna at an after show party the complex energy between jack gleeson and charles dance made me giggle with glee that kid is amazing he was all bark bark one minute and then when tywin came and glowered down at him his eyes were like a guilty labrador now is it me or does anyone else think of michael palin every time qyburn starts talking thanks for the blog sarah have a nice nap now "
"1100" "Simgeo" 2013-05-13 " i know i should watch tonights show before reading this but i couldnt help myself this blog is one of the highlights of my week as much as the show itself thanks for the heads up about theon ill be sure to keep a cushion handy to hide behind while all thats going on q how many kingsguards does it take to change a lightbulba none that would be a violation of their sacred oath "
"1101" "RedHerrings" 2013-05-13 " agentscully2006  clearly youre too young to remember su pollard in hidehi "
"1102" "anonnyscouse" 2013-05-13 " i enjoyed it except for the theon scene but it is interesting to note that this is the only episode of the season scripted by martin yet it featured the most gratuitous nudity i have no problem with it myself but it makes a mockery of those who complain about nude scenes not taken from the books neither the theon scene or the talisa scene were in the books when the author himself is adding them in his script good use of the dragons this week they looked genuinely threatening also the osha speech may not have been needed for the viewer but it was for bran and friends as the only indication bran had about white walkers having woken up was back in the pilot episode and even then he might not have believed it interesting segueing of scenes from bronn you pay me to kill people you hate into the tywin and joffrey scene "
"1103" "AgentScully2006" 2013-05-13 " jon snows girlfriend is the most annoying character on television ever "
