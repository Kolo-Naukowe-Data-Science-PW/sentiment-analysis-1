"1" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-04-22 " sadly im pretty sure that syrio is gone the knight in question ser meryn trant appeared to be in good health in a subsequent scene and after all syrio only had a broken wooden sword and the lumbering knight was a member of both roberts and joffreys kingsguard ie also an elite fighting man "
"2" "achillyseal" 2012-04-22 " thanks for clearing that up i thought i must have missedforgotten another one because i wasnt assuming the leading braavosi sword would fall to a lumbering knight so soon after his not today death lesson to arya "
"3" "ScotiaNova" 2012-04-21 " well we assume that syrio died    not today    "
"4" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-04-21 " speaking as someone who has read got but not acok i have to say that on tonights viewing i had no idea that that was meant to be how this scene was meant to be received i just took brienne as a handy fighter without seeing her as especially good or indeed of loras as especially good perhaps more attention could have been paid to the tournaments particularly the one in kings landing which was a major and costly affair  loras and the mountain would have been the equivalent of wimbledon finalists i suppose it probably didnt help that sir hugh who was inexperienced and presumably not that good was shown riding just before the final bout but that was for plotcompression reasons rather than being about his performance in the tournament "
"5" "achillyseal" 2012-04-21 " yoren who became the second man on this show to die for arya stark i know i should pay more attention but who was the first please "
"6" "badger1969" 2012-04-21 " comparing the books to the tv series my assumption is that the ages of most of the characters   the key events of roberts rebellion  have been moved roughly 3 years for example in the books robb is 14 sansa 11 arya 9 bran 7  rickon 3 in the first episode of the tv series bran is 10  rickon is 6 sansa is 13 rather than 14 arya im also fairly sure is 10 or 11 but then the ages of the middle kids are probably fairly flexible the key events of roberts rebellion seem to have been shifted from 14 years ago books to 17 years ago tv in episode 1 of game of thrones viserys claims he has waited 17 years to get my throne backin episode 2 catelyn says to ned 17 years ago you rode off to war with robert baratheon you came back a year later with another womans son in the books dany is 13  was only a quickening in their mothers womb when they fled kings landing to escape the advancing armies of the usurper and was born on dragonstone 9 moons after their flight "
"7" "pintsizedblonde" 2012-04-21 " i as im sure with most readers was a little taken back and maybe even a bit sad with what happens later on  i wont quote the rest but that was a massive spoiler  thanks mate is it me or has the guardian stopped removing spoiler posts i dont know if many of you book readers have noticed but there are fewer and fewer nonbook readers about please stop speculating about what implications casting decisions etc have on future events  that leads to giving too much away about future events ive really enjoyed reading this blog  both for this series and last but if this carries on i will have to stop  it looks like lots of others already have "
"8" "sunnyone" 2012-04-20 " do i scent another fan of jaime it feels wrong that i like him so much well ok its a crush when he did such an awful thing to bran but thats part of the brilliance of the books the baddies are hardly ever all bad the monsters are usually human and yes jaime is superbly cast as are most of the characters "
"9" "JohnDear" 2012-04-20 " nikolaj costerwaldau is great casting there a line somewhere jamie had  a smile that cut like knife nikolaj certainly has that "
"10" "Shackalack" 2012-04-20 " robb is the eldest stark jon is a snow not a stark i would advise caution if you arent a bookie on this topic research could result in spoilers abound ill say no more "
"11" "sunnyone" 2012-04-20 " talking of jaime well sort of but somewhat off topic i did get to see headhunters and thought it was a fairly enjoyable way to spend an hour or so on a cold afternoon ive seen better films but ive seen far worse too "
"12" "JohnDear" 2012-04-19 " its not just the children who are younger in the books jaime lannister for example was only 17 when he became the kingslayer and is 32 at the the time of got "
"13" "sunnyone" 2012-04-19 " thanks for the research i suppose the definitive answer is simply that all the kids were a lot younger in the books than they are on the telly and i dont suppose it really matters "
"14" "Cariad007" 2012-04-19 " sounds about right if jon was born towards the end of roberts rebellion for reasons i would love to go into but cannot "
"15" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-04-19 " i found that in book 1 rob is not yet 16 whilst jon snow is 17 i had not realised that jon snow is actually the older brother are you sure about jon i distinctly recall thinking he was awfully young 15 like rob to decide to join the nights watch i have all the books on kindle which makes trying to look things up awfully tedious well according to a got wiki which im nervous of reading far into as it may have spoliers at the beginning of a game of thrones jon is fourteen years old and robb stark opened the series as a boy of fourteen years whilst robb is meeting with his banners about 34 of the way through book 1 hes not yet 16 but i was sure id read that at a later point in book 1 where robbs on the wallnight watch and has taken the black its mentioned that jons uncle says that at 17 hes too green to be a ranger etc at another point in the wiki of ice and fire its said that robb is the eldest stark son but the wiki also says that jon is believed to have been born towards the end of roberts rebellion within one month give or take of the sack of kings landing returning from the war lord eddard stark brought the new born babe jon to winterfell yet also says robb was born in riverrun presumably the product of eddard and catelyns wedding night for eddard raced off to war immediately following the nuptials to fight in roberts rebellion upon his return from the war catelyn greeted ned with an infant robb and all returned to winterfell so it looks as if they were born around the same time which made it doubly difficult for catelyn  any definitive answer is welcome  "
"16" "Cariad007" 2012-04-19 " shes still writing them and her latest has just come out in the uk "
"17" "sunnyone" 2012-04-19 " i found that in book 1 rob is not yet 16 whilst jon snow is 17 i had not realised that jon snow is actually the older brother are you sure about jon i distinctly recall thinking he was awfully young 15 like rob to decide to join the nights watch i have all the books on kindle which makes trying to look things up awfully tedious "
"18" "sunnyone" 2012-04-19 " now the wars of the roses novel that should really be adapted is sharon penmans brilliant sunne in splendour i read all sharon penmans books years ago i do agree that they are all very good and from what i remember sunne in splendour was indeed splendid "
"19" "sunnyone" 2012-04-19 " its up for preorder on amazon too i have a feeling i might just shell out the asking price on this one "
"20" "SarahHughes" 2012-04-19 " no sadly i was lied to my local waterstones and they tricked me into giving them three quid to reserve a copy "
"21" "JohnDear" 2012-04-19 " you have to remember catelyn is a tully family duty honor are the words of house tully family always comes first "
"22" "candylilacs" 2012-04-19 " thats one of the reasons catelyn is so unforgiving about jon that he was fathered when they had just married not that you should excuse catelyns behavior but thats her schtick "
"23" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-04-19 " the longer year idea is the one i go with too it seemed appropariate after rob became king of the north as it was just too weird to have so many men declare themselves to a boy in his mid teens but if hes closer to 20 than 15 i can stomach it a bit better i found that in book 1 rob is not yet 16 whilst jon snow is 17 i had not realised that jon snow is actually the older brother "

"29" "muirman" 2012-04-19 " watching it back to back with mad men i was struck with the similarities between theon and pete campbell both desperately seeking a father figures love and approval both making really bad decisions and whining both stuck being not one thing and not the other not the younger generation or the older in petes case not a stark and not yet fully ironborn in his families eyes for theon both in depreate need of a sword in the throatdamn good thrashing from a myopic englishman "

"34" "MJ1972" 2012-04-19 " i dont think i will rewatch the episode after reading that prt in the second book and think it was cleverly done i think you will i get what youre saying about book adaptations being able to stand on their own without requiring any knowledge of the books but the reason why i and others like the yorenandarya scene so much is because it does some very clever foreshadowing dont worry you wont have to read the books to get it hbo will show you what that scene established as aryas story progresses did arya not wonder then why she was disguised as a boy and had to flee was that not explained to her and made clear i have to admit having a poor recollection of that scene from the first series but it seems hard to believe that she would not be aware or made aware of her situation by her guardian yoren as to the perilous nature of her predicament why the hell did she think she had to be disguised and flee arya is very much aware of the danger she is in which is why she is in disguise and has sworn gendry to secrecy about her identity she knows or suspects that the powers that be are looking for her and that their motives for doing so may not be altogether altruistic so yes she is well aware that the soldiers pose a threat to her however shes a brave and loyal girl who doesnt leave her companions in the lurch unless she really really has to and whats more shes capable of recognising a hopeless situation when she sees one thats why she doesnt try to evade the soldiers after the initial attempt she knows she doesnt stand a chance of escape so she just tries to make the best of a bad situation hoping that none of the soldiers will recognise that shes a girl and think hold on this might be that arya stark girl that several parties in kings landing have been trying to find "

"41" "chutzzpah" 2012-04-18 " hi sarah thanks for reponding  i agree you did make your feelings clear at the beggining  i think most of the frustration and annoyance is aimed at the guardian not you for not revisting their editorial decision in the face of such a loud negative reponse after the first blog you had written i appreciate that editorial red lines  having worked in broadcasting not as a writer mind i can barely spell can be worse than a third line party whip in the commons at times  but i think that the etiquette for blog style pieces where the life blood of the piece is maintained by the comments section rather than a political piece say where the article can stand on its own is very different  and i think the editors in their infinite wisdom do not understand that  a 1 sentance admission by the editor at the top of the following weeks blog would have gone a loooong way to dissolve alot of the bad feeling  even if it was to say  we arnt changing our minds because we are now us centric and you brits are already a captured audiance because lets face it it that is whats going on here good luck with it all but like many others its the excitment of blogging straight after the show that does it for me  ive lost the momentum 24 hours later "

"58" "MoreTears" 2012-04-18 " actually wolf hall is to be a bbchbo coproduction rather than a pure hbo project and since the book is british and the subject matter is british that probably means the bbc will be making a lot of the creative decisions and hbo will mostly just pitch in a good amount of cash about the casting for cromwell i think the whole project is in such an early stage of development they havent even approached the casting stage yet "

"79" "Urfe" 2012-04-18 " not necessarily all the makers had to do was point out that the series is set in a period not unlike the middle ages and it was common for girls of 13 14 to be married and pregnant you only to have look at how old philippa of hainault was when she got married and when she had first child i think got would be more interesting if it had emphasised how young some of the characters were when their whole world was turned upside down and how they had to learn to cope after all we see it with children on the news during famines and civil wars now if it is acceptable to show something like that in a current affairs programme why is it unacceptable to show it in a drama so are you saying you would find it acceptable to show a 13 or 14 year old girl in some of the scenes that daenarys has appeared in with drogo or someone portraying a 13 or 14 year old girl both of which are illegal and highly unacceptable or cut the scenes completely "

"82" "5432Hun" 2012-04-18 " eh where does she do that she doesnt explicitly but alluding to the relationship between two characters who have not yet met is getting close to confirming that those characters will be alive in future series part of the joy of these stories is you really dont know who or when an apparently crucial character will die i was just a bit concerned the discussion was heading into territory where someone says something like im looking forward to when x meets y in series 3 thus my heads up sort of the equivalent of shouting fore in golf "

"86" "SheriffFatman" 2012-04-18 " first off  can i just point out that some of what you are writing is coming dangerously close to giving away plot from books not yet adapted im sure this is not your intention but in a story where anyone can die no matter how seemingly important to the plot its only fair to those who have not read the books that we who have dont let on which characters might be alive or not in the future eh where does she do that "
"87" "SheriffFatman" 2012-04-18 " if you look at the later paintings of henry viii you would be hard pressed to imagine he used to be a great warrior too right in his younger days henry viii could leap into the saddle in full plate armour without using stirrups and was very proud of the fact "

"89" "5432Hun" 2012-04-18 " i agree with the general point that they are packing alot in and probably could make some changes to slow things down a bit i dont find myself lost ive read the books twice but can appreciate that it may feel rushed to others having said that i think you are being a little overcritical of the writers the writers have to work with what theyve got and in cofk there simply isnt such a clear focal point to the story as ned at this point the characters have broken out in many different directions and new characters need to be introduced i think youre right about tyrion in that they havent really got across his motivations in kings landing which given the shit he has to put up with are remarkably noble to make sure the city survives the warlunacy of cersei and joffrey and a big dollop of trying to win his fathers respect on the side this is a shame because as you say if cofk is anyones story its tyrions on dany i kind of agree they obviously dont have the budgettime to have her wandering about the desert for long periods so theyve reduced it down to her static khalasaar waiting for the rider she sent out to return i was a surprised that thread wasnt picked up at the end of this episode but i expect it will next "
"90" "MJ1972" 2012-04-18 " fair enough i actually concur with several of your criticisms particularly those involving the rushedness of the show yes the number of characters and storylines does seem to be a little too high for narrative coherence and exciting storytelling personally though i feel that the showrunners are doing a good job under the circumstances compared with the first episode of season 2 which felt incredibly rushed the two most recent ones have been fairly good i think and i suspect they will only get better now that the showrunners seem to have realised that its ok to focus on some characters while ignoring other characters for an episode or two as for yorens final scene feeling rushed and underchoregraphed i think its clear that whoever directed that scene is more at ease with small character set pieces than with exciting battle scenes i suppose it would bother me if the other arya scenes were equally weak but the fact is theyre not apart from the night watch recruits runin with lorch et al the arya scenes have been superb so far so im willing to forgive the showrunners for somewhat screwing up the fight with lorchs men because yeah i agree they could have done a better job on that scene danys desert scenes dont bother me shes stuck in a waste and they have to show that i think its actually somewhat fitting that they should show her being lost and aimlessly wandering around while others are fighting wars or playing at fighting wars i mean here she is potentially the most dangerous and awesome character in the show and what does she do she languishes and nearly starves to death reminding us that even heroes go through rough patches and that even major players have to sit on the sidelines sometimes i kind of like it actually of course it doesnt hurt that iain glen is in danys scenes i refuse to think of any scene involving iain glen as ser jorah as a waste of time he doesnt even have to do anything to make the scene worthwhile for me just let him look at her with concern in his eyes and voila instant viewer happiness as for a montage showing how dany gets to where she ends up going im not sure that would work i think it would be a bit messy and quite frankly a little bit of a copout as far as im concerned they should save their montages for battle scenes and possibly wolf dreams but hey thats just one girls opinion  "

"96" "DiamondDag" 2012-04-18 " ive read the books and i didnt particularly enjoy this episode there were good points certainly but my continuing problem is how rushed everything feels i know how much story there is to pack in but nothing feels like it has any time to breath at the moment the last scene with yorens death just felt too muddled and rushed oh er these guys turn up and erm they rush outside and errrr they fight a bit then stop then run away then get caught and er quick mention harrenhal as you say that moment with yoren and arya was wonderful and the way it introduced a small little detail was great thats what i want a bit more of if they cant make a decent fist of choreographing an action scene then dont waste the time do a whispering wood and show the aftermath or something dany is another good example think where she is in terms of the story at the end of the 3rd episode which she didnt even appear in just sat out in the desert not a specific desert just somewhere no goals nothing happening so shes just there with so much going on it feels like a colossal waste of the character and time would it kill them to fall back on the tried and tested montage to get her to wherever the hell shes going i realise im probably being overly critical and it is just one guys opinion but the characters stories are suffering for being cut up into tiny little pieces and spread around seemingly at random contrast the first series when there was so much more structure you basically had ned at the center and then his investigations around which much of the story revolved nothing like that has appeared yet to pull the story together i suppose tyrion is the closest to that but again he isnt actually working towards anything yet hes simply doing things but i know there are brilliant moments to come with some great actors and good writing so there is no way ill stop watching "

"152" "5432Hun" 2012-04-17 " my family has recently finished watching the first series on dvd and my mother found it very hard to follow what was going on and spent a lot of it asking me what happened in the books so i am not sure that hbo has thought through the issue of the uninformed part of the audience hmm   theres a balance to be struck here mrs5432hun much as she has enjoyed the series has had some problems following the story and she has watched the whole first series 3 times she then started reading cofk and within a couple of chapters was asking me if theon was a new character so your mother is not alone in this the problem is that if they wrote a series with my wife in mind all the characters would have a card round their neck saying baddie and goodie and every plot twist would need to be set out on a flipchart my own view is theyve done a very good job of adaptation but ultimately the audience will decide whether the writers have made the plot too complicated or insultingly simplistic the one thing that has really irritated me throughout the first series is the bad casting i agree mark addy was not the best casting as robert hard to believe he could ever have been a mighty warrior although this may partly be because we know him so well as a tubby idiot i also think gethin anthony is miscast as renly youre probably in a very small minority on sean bean though i dont see the ppoint youre making about his not looking like a lord the whole point of the north is that it is not a place for fineries and lords are expected to pitch in along with everyone else in historical terms the northmen are very anglosaxon while the southerners distinctly plantagenet i can see what youre saying about the hair of the lannisterstargaryens lena heady as cersei particularly looks a bit incongrouus if you think about it but to be honest its a shoiw where im prepared to suspend my disbelief on the existence of dragons so a few dodgy highlights doesnt worry me "

"223" "MJ1972" 2012-04-17 " in the books shae is a whining ungrateful petulant whore the only difference is she doesnt have an accent she is all about being mercenary and bitches all the time about pretty much everything despite all the gifts he lavishes on her and the troubles he takes on her behalf to me the main difference between book shae and tv shae is that book shae has some arts whereas tv shae is a completely overthetop whiny child yes book shae complains yes book shae is petulant but as i recall it she remains somewhat alluring and sophisticated while being petulant whereas tv shae is basically behaving like a spoilt child id like to think that book shae was a little more subtle than that then again ive only read the books once and its entirely possible that a reread will show me a shae who is every bit as cringeworthy as her tv counterpart either way its a pity shae is developing the way she is because i actually quite liked her in season 1 there was some mystique to her in season 1 that mystique is gone now to the point where im really not sure what tyrion sees in her like i said in a previous post the kings landing scenes could do with a better director shae littlefinger and cersei are all in need of more expert directing "
"224" "TheSub" 2012-04-17 " some excellent points you have there i think the narrative is very clever in that it sets us up to get into the same mindset as the nobles from the great houses mainly and so we start thinking like them we start thinking that only those who have a name family land and men have real power and matter in the game again cerseis scene with baelish in s02e01 springs to mind o how wrong we may yet be "

"229" "pillroad" 2012-04-17 " i think you may be ive loved it thus far and enjoy the way its embraced the political subtlety that tyrion gives the second book but to address your gripe remember the 1st 4  5 episodes of season 1 were mainly setting things up also the best episodes were in the second half of the season when things hit crisis point and there was less exposition to get through while this isnt quite the same with season 2 theres obviously less exposition to get across however the new characters nevertheless demand quite a bit of back story even by this episode the likes of marg tyrell and briene need to be introduced many dialogues you may feel as being much ado about nothing are likely to have significance later on due to significant characters being introduced remember the book has a luxury of introducing seemingly innocuous characters and fleshing them out later after the readers perconceptions have been formed martin does this quite a lot with both major and minor characters for instance who would have thought theon would be a significant character based on his book 1 coverage the tv show doesnt have quite the same luxuries in this regard it has to introduce major characters as major characters pretty much from the outset even if the book doesnt do the same "

"273" "Lalwende" 2012-04-16 " firstly  about the guy supposedly playing the mountain  im sure i heard him say he was amory lorch a different character im sure gregor clegane doesnt turn up at this point hes just this terrifying story being passed around the peasants anyway brienne was spot on just the right look to her i thought and she managed to portray her as a devoted follower of renly with an almost religious zeal i also liked the entire lack of subtlety to the renlymargaery relationship margaerys personal power would be hard to get across on screen without hitting us over the head a bit with her political wisdom and it also managed to convey how close the tyrell siblings are and what rivals to the lannisters they could be "
"274" "5432Hun" 2012-04-16 " great episode  my favourite if series 2 so far night watch and arya scenes continue to be my favourite glad yoren got a good exit margaery tyrell is super hot renly must be really really really gay "
"275" "Pillowhead" 2012-04-16 " oh and i know everyone will say shes too pretty but brienne looked a really good fit to me got the dour personality right down already and her exchange with cat was nice "
"276" "Pillowhead" 2012-04-16 " best exchange without doubt was i may misquote as only just watched it feed his manhood to the goatsthere are no goats half manwell make do cracking episode i thought nice balance to everything good plot progression i thought the margary scene was really interesting and well added and the bit at the end with arya was brilliant cant wait for some tickling tyrion owned this episode and yet again proved pointless brothel scenes are not required to advance or add to the plot "
"277" "blaggard" 2012-04-16 " re margaery tyrell dressingfor the warm its been a while since i read the books but in last nights episode there was a suggestion i think by her brother that she is not in fact a virgin just claimed to be for reason of royal marriage etc i didnt really see a problem with it yes it helps that natalie dormer is quite nice to look at ill grant you "
"278" "GrayArea" 2012-04-16 " i think he just got a better offer hes been a regular in spartacus and is going to be playing an orc chieftain in the hobbit just one of those things same story with rakharo last week "
"279" "DiamondDag" 2012-04-16 " im not sure acting is much of a priority when it comes to gregor clegane so youre really quite enormously massive and you can do that bulging eyeballs thing yup hired "
"280" "hoover2001" 2012-04-16 " thanks for that yeah that is a little disappointing considering the original mountain was one scary looking guy maybe he just couldnt act a lick "
"281" "singist" 2012-04-16 " ive been rereading and i read that sentence just a few days ago so it was fresh in my mind "
"282" "sunnyone" 2012-04-16 " ooh how silly how very sad i find myself wanting to post something like only half an hour to go "
"283" "sunnyone" 2012-04-16 " have you only just got here candylilacs only weve had this renlyloras conversation before that quotation of singists has been posted once of twice "
"284" "candylilacs" 2012-04-16 " ok there was a whisper  but there werent any pillow talk scenes it was left to the reader to decide if it was actually true and to be honest with so many other characters in the books i barely noticed out of curiosity did you have that quote at the ready or did you have to look for it "
"285" "DiamondDag" 2012-04-16 " yeah there was more than a whisper "
"286" "singist" 2012-04-16 " meh i dont know maybe im just in a funny mood but i didnt really enjoy this episode i cant put my finger on why but im sure margaerys towie outfit had something to do with it "
"287" "singist" 2012-04-16 " in the books there was never a whisper of a sexual relationship between renly and loras i dont know about that sheathe your bloody sword or ill take it from you and shove it up some place renly never found "
"288" "candylilacs" 2012-04-16 " i think shae is not supposed to be overly sympathetic shes also a pragmatist and her goal is a better life through whoring  and being a maid isnt a better life so shes not as happy as she could be she also knows she can push the boundaries with tyrion because he cares for her so youll probably see more of her being sullen  but most of you are right i pictured her more pouty than pissed off as for renly margaery and loras  in the books there was never a whisper of a sexual relationship between renly and loras so adding it to the series clears that up neatly in the books margaery was also about 16 so it was easy to think of her as a pure maiden in the tv series being 26 and wearing gowns cut down to her waist that facade doesnt work as well personally i was glad they cut out a few storylines this week it helped concentrate on the few it had this episode unlike last weeks really worked and moved the plot along eager to see whats going on with daenarys next week "
"289" "TheSub" 2012-04-16 " indeed in season one he was very androgynous and thereby quite attractive now that he looks more masculine he has rather lost it for me "
"290" "candylilacs" 2012-04-16 " i thought loras was another actor too but as i looked at him i think he put on about 20 pounds which makes him not so waifboyish anymore now hes kind of blah looking where before he was actually pretty "
"291" "TheSub" 2012-04-16 " ive been trying to tell you guys since last week hes slowly changing into run burgundy its the only explanation "
"292" "TheSub" 2012-04-16 " one question did they replace the mountain yes sadly this is the new mountain i think o utter bloody blasted bollocks might it have something to do with the original mountain having his face chopped off in spartacus vengeance wait sorry im confusing my overly gory fictional worlds again "
"293" "ScotiaNova" 2012-04-16 " aidens accent certainly has changed this week    "
"294" "GrayArea" 2012-04-16 " was that the tickler who killed the boy with the arrow in his leg polliver i just remember the arya story that begins here to be exceptionally brutal will they go there no idea but they are apparently going to go straight to harrenhal so its going to be compressed "
"295" "GrayArea" 2012-04-16 " one question did they replace the mountain yes sadly this is the new mountain i think "
"296" "hoover2001" 2012-04-16 " scratch that i meant three questions "
"297" "hoover2001" 2012-04-16 " christ on a cracker i cant get enough of this show one question did they replace the mountain was that the tickler who killed the boy with the arrow in his leg i just remember the arya story that begins here to be exceptionally brutal will they go there "
"298" "MerMer" 2012-04-16 " am i the only one who thinks season 2 is much poorer at the level of screenplay than season 1 i am not really enjoying this new season at all i have read the books season 1 was really faithful to the book even in the dialogues in this season i have the feeling that dialogues are muchadoaboutnothing dont know characters dont really get the point its a strange feeling i dont know how to explain did you get same impressions "
"299" "NearlyHeadlessNed" 2012-04-16 " i agree conleth hill is my favourite as well though patrick malahide as balon greyjoy is up there as well "
"300" "NearlyHeadlessNed" 2012-04-16 " i get the feeling that master villain is the mask that little finger shows to the world to disguise his weakness tyrion doesnt he uses his as armour as he advised john snow to in the first season "
"301" "DiamondDag" 2012-04-16 " all good points and i have to admit that its been a good while since i read the first few books so im maybe building up some of these characters into people they arent which is unfair on the show anyway id just like to say screw tyrion and dinklage conleth hill as varys is the best thing in the show there ive said it "
"302" "GrayArea" 2012-04-16 " id rather have balon greyjoy its a pretty fullon mancrush problem is hed probably want to pay the iron price gives new meaning to what is dead may never die but rises again harder and stronger "
"303" "sunnyone" 2012-04-16 " i know theres no time but maybe some earlier rounds could have been squeezed in  montage style as cat approached from further away what a very good idea how come benioff and thingummy never thought of this would it have cost too much money i wonder cos when you think about it we could have seen a few montages  i think not flashbacks per se just maybe a few still photos that would also be helpful to those who havent read the book "
"304" "GrayArea" 2012-04-16 " loras still bugs the crap out of me turn a charismatic and excellent fighter who loves renly into a jealous stroppy teenager who looks like he should be in coronation street or something no thanks although i agree to some extent aside from the stroppyness or petulance as i said above i think a major problem is simply the lack of evidence of how good a fighter he is the scene with the mountain in s01 reduced his prowess to trickery alone and since we only see loras vs brienne we dont see how good brienne had to be to beat him and what a surprise it was i know theres no time but maybe some earlier rounds could have been squeezed in  montage style as cat approached from further away "
"305" "DiamondDag" 2012-04-16 " another episode of good and bad its just not clicking with me this series i might be alone on this blog but too many things are creeping in that leave me scratching my head there are still wonderful moments donald sumpter stole the episode for me but but if youve taken so much care over everything why make a tiny stupid mistake like putting margaery in a revealing dressing as her brother says shes suppose be all innocent and virginal but the producers seem to have decided half way through they wanted some type of femme fatale so just bung her in a low cut dress and have her scheme a bit a dress is such a stupid thing to be annoyed about i know i cant help it the scene with amory lorch was a bit of a mess too but that was understandable for the sake of condensing the story and yoren did get an absolutely brilliant send off not only with the fight but his little talk with arya loras still bugs the crap out of me turn a charismatic and excellent fighter who loves renly into a jealous stroppy teenager who looks like he should be in coronation street or something no thanks "
"306" "waterfordgirl" 2012-04-16 " so excited to watch got this evening when i get home from work i just had to read the blog and the comments which i love as well there are going to be so many more comments that it is nice to be able to read and comment on the smaller number at present looking forward to seeing the performance by natalie dormer of course i identify her with anne boleyn and she isnt who i had in mind for the role of margery and i was interested to see the mixed reviews re her performance response to rosimir i have read the books and advise you to keep an eye on varys he is such an important character and he is involved in so many twists and turns it will make your head spin cant wait to see arya and sansa and looking forward to seeing brienne in her first appearance she is one of my favourite characters from the books to quote grayarea glad to hear that things are falling into place  "
"307" "diegowesterberg" 2012-04-16 " ha straight into the cut id rather have balon greyjoy its a pretty fullon mancrush problem is hed probably want to pay the iron price "
"308" "GrayArea" 2012-04-16 " yeah totally agree shes my favourite if she isnt leading an army or on the iron throne herself one day then westeros is a bad place and i no longer want to go to there shed be a great hand imagine someone is ticking off the king or queen and arya just quietly says their name as if its added to some sort of list "
"309" "GrayArea" 2012-04-16 " natalie dormer as margaery tyrell does nothing for me as an actress or a woman would you prefer we got loras for you sorry couldnt resist "
"310" "TheSub" 2012-04-16 " i think the main reason loras looks so different is that they got rid of that horrible wig from season 1 and let him go natural either that or highgarden has better hair salons than kings landing good point either the hair salons or kings landings hot climate was just drying out his locks it might also be because loras was only featured once or twice in the first season so we didnt really get to know him "
"311" "diegowesterberg" 2012-04-16 " patrick malahide is balon greyjoy best piece of casting yet shae is far too different from the books why is someone as cunning as tyrion risking his position for a whiny ungrateful and petulant former whore very little chemistry between the two yorens death was great i can only hope my last words are as badass as i always hated crossbows liked the touch of him being the source of aryas yettobeseen prayers for various deaths as well natalie dormer as margaery tyrell does nothing for me as an actress or a woman "
"312" "JamesDonaghy" 2012-04-16 " aaaah arya  its just shes just flawless all those scenes yeah totally agree shes my favourite if she isnt leading an army or on the iron throne herself one day then westeros is a bad place and i no longer want to go to there "
"313" "grayfox" 2012-04-16 " wow 10 comments already it looks like this usafirst policy is really working out isnt it and thats despite all the warnings still better to be stubborn than just admit youve made a mistake hey "
"314" "sunnyone" 2012-04-16 " whats to like with catelyn her stupidity kicked the whole thing off and whats more she is mean and nasty to jon snow "
"315" "BenjyUK" 2012-04-16 " an unpopular opinion maybe buti cant find it in me to like catelyn shes a bloody bore margaery and mel really are a welcome refreshment and not just because of their promiscuity varys is so brilliantly played i kind of feel he isnt getting the love he deserves the conniving treacherous bastard "
"316" "tassiegel" 2012-04-16 " i have to say that i nearly gave up on the searies last week i watched the first series without having read the books and spent half the time totally confused and lost this series i have read all the books what i liked about the books was the complexity of the characters they werent goodies and badies what i have found really hard about the series so far is that so many of the characters are being written a lot more flat the men come off as pigs and tihe women are just whores waiting to spread their legs enough of the bloody brothel scenes there is so much plot and dialogue to get through and they just put me off yes i am a woman having said all that i did enjoy this week the scene with bran and his maester was lovelythe scenes with tyrion whittling down the small council were sublimearya is still my favourite character and her scene with yoren was very touchingevery time i see sansa i think poor sansa shes gone from being a character who illicited very little sympathy in the first series to being one who we really feel for in this right on the moneybrienne is perfectly cast but im not too sure about margery isnt every one else supposed to see her as a virgin not in that dressas for theon not sure about him i absolutely despised his character in the books but im finding myself feeling almost sympathetic for him in this series and i so want to hate him but i loved ashayara in thebooks but think shes being portrayed as a total bitch in the series feel like the writers are trying to manipulate our sympathy with these twoenjoyed this week much more as we got to see more character development less whoring "
"317" "orangescarves" 2012-04-16 " oh and sansa and arya are slowly breaking my heart they were both great in this episode "
"318" "orangescarves" 2012-04-16 " thesub i think the main reason loras looks so different is that they got rid of that horrible wig from season 1 and let him go natural either that or highgarden has better hair salons than kings landing it was a great episode theyve managed to slow things down after the necessary introductions to new characters in the first two episodes and let things breathe brienne and margaery are brilliant marg in particular so game do you want me to get my brother wonderful "
"319" "Joemanji" 2012-04-16 " i dont see the problem with the blog being up now if you dont want to read spoilers dont look i for one like being able to read this on mondays after having seen the show online "
"320" "TheSub" 2012-04-16 " about the timing of the blog i have to agree that i also find it strange that the blog goes up before the episode is screened in the uk i mean look at the amount of discussion going on now its actually not a discussion its just a few of us posting our thoughts on the past episode anyway ive managed to see it so here goes not as good as last weeks but still not too bad tyrion brilliant as always i like the way in which this episode showed how his power increased and yet he is not so sure of himself as he was last week the way his sister simply pushed him over onto the stairs was a nice touch i think sansa and shae im still not feeling too sympathetic to sansa shae who i initially quite liked is getting on my nerves a bit shes like the cheeky kid that doesnt entertain anymore lets hope ss spending time in each others company will make both of them more interesting because at this stage they are only interesting to me because of their relation to other important characters theon o theon theon theon i was waiting for his father to smack him because every episode has him moaning about something at least hes got some direction now and hes doing something for himself littlefinger if aidan gillen showed signs of ron burgundy last week then this week its the whole bloody bulletin his accent is all over the place and i still feel like his performance has gone downhill up until the first episode of this series he was all cold clever and calculating he was also another thing that would have added nicely to my assimilation there cersei obviously unsettled him and showed him that his foundations were not as strong as he had thought but ever since hes become inconsistent surely a calculating man who is as hungry for power as baelish wouldnt go all paranoid like he seems to be doing he used to be a calculating cword now hes just a timid tword yoren and arya yoren was such a likeable character pity went out chopping and slicing though i do like the way arya is being forced to become more and more independent by her protectors constantly being offed she might turn out to be a very good player yet beyond the wall that went quite slow after last weeks cliffhanger meh renly and co the dynamics between renly loras and margaery are very interesting catelyn starks few moments with them gave her ample time to prove they were boys playing at war and the way in which she was dismissed by the rather pompous and horny renly just proved her point lucky for him he has margaery around and she seems eager to scheme and rule alright performances throughout but i was surprised because for a moment i thought theyd replaced loras with another actor turns out he just grew up everyone we didnt see well no danaerys and jorah no rob no lars ulrich lannister no melisandre and stannis and no annoying joffrey this week doesnt surprise me at all  the pace of the episode was already super fast with all the new stuff they had to get in we know what to expect from next weeks episode then "
"321" "bbbbbbbbbbbbb" 2012-04-16 " for all the people complaining about the blog being up a day early dont click on the link looking forward to watching this tonight i have particularly been looking forward to brienne "
"322" "MilkMe" 2012-04-16 " couldnt ya simply just wait one more day before posting these series blogsis it such a struggle "
"323" "Rosimir" 2012-04-16 " enjoyed the tyrion scenes  i dont trust varys am nonreader i dont hear welsh or english in aiden gillens voice just irish agree regarding catelyns disgust and despair shae brought to kings landing surely "
"324" "GrayArea" 2012-04-16 " brienne  phewhooray she was just perfect of course shes not strictly ugly enough but i dont think that matters tyrion is way too good looking too and he owns that part her manner her look even her walk all perfect cant wait for more balontheon  fantastic this relationship continues to excel and confounds my recollection of the books where if im honest the iron islands were my least favourite chapters balon has a mean slap ashayara  getting a little concerned now she had more screen time and i have yet to see the quick wit maybe when shes out of the balon theon shadow shell shine hope so she needs to be less grimacy and much much more charismatic funny sharp its how she leads men and what makes her attractive to them  not her looks shae  i dont know i cant decide whether i dont like her because of the portrayal or because i really didnt like her in the books she just seems i dont know too argumentative and sullen she needs to be sexually manipulative but in a smallminded way or something like that sansa  great performance this week shes really heartbreaking to watch  the fear the act how trapped and hopeless she looks if only someone could help her tyrion  oh yes id been waiting for this particular scheme and it didnt disappoint great acting and great editing too varys  still paddling expertly love the mutual appreciation society scene with tyrion margaery  very smooth introduction of her character nicely sidestepping ah margaery of highgarden nice to meet you she looked the part and everything seemed fine then the bedroom scene with renly brilliant that to me showed so much about her character in a very efficient way shes introduced as a player now renlylorasmargaery  i think renly and loras and the three of them this episode really go beyond the books an a good way i suppose if we were to be picky loras seems a little more petulant than his book counterpart but to be honest the book versions of all three have benefited from a little beefing up littlefinger  the accent continues to meander its way around the celtic fringes very odd nice to see him without moustachetwirling evil pimp mode on full blast yoren  perfect end to great portrayal take a bolt to the shoulder knowing it will take too long to load another now thats a hard man another character i feel has been improved upon if anything nice touch with arya and the source of her nightly prayer aaaah arya  its just shes just flawless all those scenes the story compression is needed i see i think it will work cant wait for next week bran  again seems to be working well loved the warging allinall this was a significant improvement on the first too which i also enjoyed things seem to be falling into place and all the necessary season introduction dispensed with roll on next week "
"325" "avdotya" 2012-04-16 " oh and completely mystified by people referring to aidan gillens accent as sounding welsh gillen was born in dublin and has a strong irish accent which he has always struggled to suppress doesnt sound remotely welsh to me "

"330" "ericbforpm" 2012-04-16 " ive always hated crossbows take too long to reload theon hasnt sat right with me since the start of series 1 an with this episode its finally struck me what it is the bloke is a crap at the very least televisual actor hes forever unnecessarily projecting and holding expressions for an unreal amount of time it does seem to be struggling with the huge cast in a way not seen with other hbo productions with similar size ensembles i mean i accept not getting to see rob stark and his army or the dragon queen for an episode but the speed between cutting from scene to scene and place to place is dizzying "
"331" "Benjamin86" 2012-04-16 " who said people power couldnt make a difference you what theyve put the game of thrones blog up on a sunday night again well there goes my faith in humanitymostly sarcasm anyway another brilliant episode it wasnt as fast paced as the previous two with a lot more focus on politics this week obviously there is too much going on to have every subplot feature in each episode so unfortunately no daenerys this week i thought wed have no arya too until the end and what a fantastic ending it was even though were only in episode three each week i get a little more gutted that we are one episode closer to end of the series how sad am i haha "
"332" "sunnyone" 2012-04-16 " sarahhughes  so all our pleading went for nought this blog continues to surface on monday morning before most of us have watched the episode thank you so much another quibble  why did last weeks comments close on thursday i for one wanted to go on discussing the last episode but the board was closed why "
"333" "ScotiaNova" 2012-04-16 " i thought i had agreed that this blog which i have no control over would only go up once that i had seen the episode being discussed    anyways shall rejoin once ive seen it after work today    "

"335" "jackman" 2012-04-16 " yoren but he went down fighting and protecting beautiful performance from francis magee expect a menage a trois in renlys bed chambers very shortly anybody else think brienne was a ringer for tilda swinton i liked the scene between luwin and bran  subtle acting from donald sumpter and nice to see summer the direwolf get a pov shot "
"336" "SiccarPoint" 2012-04-16 " some random nonspoiler thoughts shae  just isnt working for me at all she just comes across as sullen and a bit stupid and im not seeing what tyrion sees in her i always had her down as more the fun and frisky type not sullen and mysterious littlefingers accent  you guys are totally right i hadnt noticed it before but once you have its really weird its like aidan gillen is talking in a generic english accent but then just occasionally gets a bit welsh right at the end of his sentences odd but much better with less scheming this week as sarah notes margaery tyrell  whoa on a number of levels fabric must be really really expensive down in highgarden that scene with renly really caught the power dynamic between them and showed quite how green renly really is politically loras doesnt come across right still though for me neither pretty enough or perversely butchbadasswarrortype enough unlike yoren what a dude looks like all that nightwatch training is actually pretty effective "
"337" "bunkebunk" 2012-04-16 " yeah really great third episode there tyrion quickly getting into his stride as the hand of the king  unlucky pycelle thatll teach you to be a tattletale ooh and a lovely little story from the orgazoid there at the end just before he gets crossbowed to shit im just not sure brienne of tarth is as ugly as shes sposed to be though but margaery tyrell is certainly openminded for a queen eh i wonder if lizzy was that mental back in 52 "
