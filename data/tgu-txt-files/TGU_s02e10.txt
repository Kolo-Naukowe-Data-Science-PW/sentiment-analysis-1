"1" "Kulturtrager" 2012-06-09 " maureen ryan is a terrible critic but she has made a mildly interesting point about brienne brienne is one of martins most enjoyable creatures "
"2" "basiltaswell" 2012-06-09 " also anyone playing skyrim it has obvious comparisons to game of thrones and is probably a better game than the official one released recently "
"3" "5432Hun" 2012-06-08 " yes that was good i also found briennes earlier reaction to the northmens laughter quite touching the way she simply gave up trying to explain herself because she knew from experience they couldnt see past their cruel mockery of her i wasnt 100 sure about how brienne has come across on screen to start with but the last couple of episodes shes really come to life "
"4" "trickydicky" 2012-06-08 " ive been on hols so ive only just watched the final episode im not going to tell you how much i enjoyed it because i believe were limited to 1200 characters anyway apart from all the usual suspects id like to say the character ive most enjoyed or rather been surprised by is ygritte she was decent enough in the book but the actress really brought her to life for mevalar morghulis "
"5" "TeamForeign" 2012-06-08 " at the risk of simply echoing earlier posts id also like to thank sarah and all well most of the people posting comments its been great to have the blog to enjoy as well as the show itself especially woof73  you made me laugh even more than tyrion did by the way im slightly surprised that noone else has mentioned what was my favourite line from this weeks ep brienne saying two quick deaths before giving that guy a rather slow sword in the guts for me that was even better than jamies reaction to her awesome fighting skills "
"6" "ScotiaNova" 2012-06-08 " some people say they saw iciclesi thought it was ash and theyd done going to do a harrenhall on kings landing "
"7" "basiltaswell" 2012-06-08 " i just finished the episode this is my first post though i have really enjoyed s1 and s2 i assumed that in danys visions the iron throne and kings landing were not covered in snow but ash presumably from where her dragons have torched the place just a thought "
"8" "Woof73" 2012-06-08 " apologies for my recent absence ever since the last episode i have been mostly staring into fires with a disturbing look upon my face i didnt get much sleep last night got up in the middle of the night to get a glass of water and was hypnotised by the pilot light in the gas boiler thanks to lady sarah of highgarden for her sterling work under difficult conditions already looking forward to next year and ill see you all then until then ill leave you with a teaser  what if george martin isnt going to write the last books and is instead using the tv show to finish the story dundundurrr stannis baratheon "
"9" "5432Hun" 2012-06-08 " i really hope as a nonbook reader that the zombie army doesnt play a big part of season 3 i think we can safely anticipate some imminant zombie related activity for the nights watch up on the fist but please be reassured book 3 is not shaun of the dead a lot depends on the adaptation of course but i think storm of swords is the best of the books lots of character stuff political intrigue but still with some stunning set pieces "
"10" "5432Hun" 2012-06-08 " it is supposition based on the widelyheld belief that it was giving birth that killed lyanna and thus the site of the birth also being the site of her death the main source for this is neds flashbacks referring to her dying in a bed soaked with blood yes i think now you say it its reasonable supposition the imagery certainly points in that direction far out if i spent half as much time working on my own stuff as chatting about pedantic points of the history of westeros i might actually get something published write a novel about someone who cant get round to wirting their novel because theyre too busy posting on the internet and then either a they get drawn into a fantasy world or b they stumble across a crime they have to solve with the help of an autistic yet oddly attractive scandinavian guaranteed winners "
"11" "TAFKAJamie" 2012-06-07 " will not be able to confirmdeny as were in the dark as much as you though this is an increasingly popular theory not really borne out by anything in the books sadly "
"12" "ntofr1" 2012-06-07 " i think thats the general hint theyre dropping still to reach that in the books my self though "
"13" "pretendname" 2012-06-07 " i think ive got it syrio is this face shifting geezerbook readers "
"14" "Foom" 2012-06-07 " will they give you a big blue c on your posts next time or even the treasured g "
"15" "Sosha" 2012-06-07 " enjoyed it few stickers 1 tywins endless conversations with arya can see why it was done but the thought of someone who treats his nearest and not so dearest the way he does having any sort of conversation with a serving girl doesnt convince me 2 jon snow annoying price of loyalty sacrificed for mooning over a girl the time spent on them fumbling around in the snow looking petulant constipated could have been spent on the boltons likewise lose a few ooooh where are my dragons scenes "
"16" "Simgeo" 2012-06-07 " i wouldnt say wrote as such more advised when martin came to me saying i havent got a damn clue how to finish this thing for godssake dont tell anyone "
"17" "ciwstudent" 2012-06-07 " i would say that the white walkers are more similar to the ringwraiths in lotr than te orcs whereas the wights are more similar to the orcs the wights dont really have a free will they can just move slowly and kill its not really clear who commands them i think its the othersww but im not surethe ww on the other hand appear to have certain magical properties  i beleive gilly said something to sam about the white cold "
"18" "Urfe" 2012-06-07 " watched the episode with a few distractions and not had chance to rewatch it since and i know it was an illusion but i thought dany might have been a bit more emotional about seeing her son with drogo she seemed barely to give him a second glance like i said i watched with a few distractions so i may be wrong "
"19" "MrThursday" 2012-06-07 " i agree the writers are taking something from the next book and making it fit here what they will do when they get to that part in next book is unknown although the way they are playing with the stories they will probably just not mention it intereasting series i really enjoyed every episode was over too soon for me i have read the books and i actually like the differences although i am unsure i would if i didnt know that these changes have the writers blessing i presume they have as he is involved with the series bring on next series and next book would be nice too "
"20" "Redable" 2012-06-07 " thought it was great and set up the next series nicely love dany and the dragons  cheesy name for a pop band there making warlock toast im off to read all the books now so i can moan about the differences "
"21" "simonw91" 2012-06-07 " not sure what to make of the white walkerother at the end of the episode  why no ice spider on the other hand it looked thoroughly impressive like it was genuinely carved from icei loved that they finally addressed why magic was coming more prominent in the house of the undying and one last bit of drogo have to admit i welled up a little at that even if it was an illusiontrap after everything without giving too much away for the nonbook readers as far as the supernatural element goes there isnt an overwhelming amount in book 3 what you see in seriesseason 2 is pretty much what you get for a little while longeralso looked at the characters being introduced next season  were in for a treat people things are going to be explosive "
"22" "ntofr1" 2012-06-07 " meant to say earlier thanks for the blog sarah look forward to the next one d "
"23" "Sunburst" 2012-06-07 " so it was you who wrote feast and dance then "
"24" "Simgeo" 2012-06-07 " oh and a warning to george rr martin  if you dont hurry up with the last two books then ill publish alternative versions under your name and theyll be terrible itll turn out that jon snow is tyrions son by catelyn stark that the dragons drop dead from scurvy within three days of each other forcing dany to live out her days as a juggler in dorne and that ned stark was varys all along and robert didnt really die and that it was all a dream im warning you "
"25" "Simgeo" 2012-06-07 " a long comments thread and i havent read every single one so apologies if this has already been mentioned  but i think it was telling how much less doddery and more authoritative pycelle sounded in his opening verbal sparring with tyrion of course weve all suspected a lot of this was an act on pycelles part since the end of season one but this episode really brought it out and also i agree with the snow rather than ash falling in the great hall and on the iron throne wasnt too sure before but i rewatched carefully tonight and it was absolutely snowlike to me somebody mentioned icicles  i didnt see those i have to admit but ash wouldnt have formed the crystals seen on the throne itself and in danys hair "
"26" "ACertainBang" 2012-06-07 " ps meant to say what happened to woof73 i enjoyed hisher contributions much missed the last two episodes hes gone back to dragonstone with his tail between his legs and seems to have taken singist with him which can only mean that singist is indeed the lady in red i hope they will be back next year with more banter i have missed them too rewatched the episode last night and rewelled up during the tyrion  shae scene very powerful stuff also to confirm the white flakes in danys vision are snow not ash as there are icicles hanging off some of the braziers it seems my guess that the ironborn burnt winterfell might have been off as they give no indication  order to do so as a couple of posters have said above it could be being left deliberatley unclear i think the book readers may have a bit more insight into this than us noobs so ill try hold off on the theories until next year "
"27" "Sunburst" 2012-06-06 " yes most books are full of tedious descriptions its called writing youre slightly mistaken full of tedious description is usually called bad writing "
"28" "Pillowhead" 2012-06-06 " really enjoyed that finally up on sky go today some really nice scenes especially tyrion and shae and maester luwin with the boys osha and hodor i almost had a tear in my eye as they walked away from the smoking ruins of winterfell i suspect for non bookies the reason they didnt make clear what had heppened is they are saving it for next season as if you knew it would give away what is to come you can instead spend 10 months avoiding spoilers and debating it instead also finally dany does something interesting a bit disappointed about what she actually saw or rather didnt see in the house of the undying but the imahe of the snowy throneroom was very ominous i thought alfie allen actually nailed it for once as well the realisation of what he has done and then his speech also i couldnt help but shake my head at his whinging about how nice his captors were to him if anyone gets my meaning "
"29" "scandibaby" 2012-06-06 " love the horseshit too literally the horseshit not tywin reminded me of i claudius when caligula gives a stallion a position in the roman senate "
"30" "scandibaby" 2012-06-06 " ive been whinging about woof73s absence from the blogs for the past two episodes hmmm could heshe be operating covertly under another name woof73 come back to us "
"31" "scandibaby" 2012-06-06 " hear hear brian blessed is one of my favorite actors and he was a brilliant and sly augustus in i claudius but even better hawkman in flash gordon gordons alive was said with the perfect maniacal glee required "
"32" "ResourceBasedEconomy" 2012-06-06 " i guess i never thought of the walkers in the prologue to episode 1 as being zombies more as some kind of human like speciesmonsters beyond the wall something akin to orcs or uruks the references i thought were just the typical speculation and middle age type misunderstanding or something and the single guy who came back in season 1 i thought of this as an isolated thing kind of like the stupid smoky baby that stanniss witch gave birth to i really hope as a nonbook reader that the zombie army doesnt play a big part of season 3 "
"33" "pindoctor" 2012-06-06 " ill add my voice to those congratulating sarah on an excellent blog  its become an inseparable part of my viewing pleasure of this excellent series sarahs insight has added greatly to my insight and appreciation as well as often pointing out clever little details that i can then pass off as my own cleverness to my other friends d blushes agree that this series has shown the difficulty of weaving so many disparate narratives into a cohesive whole and that the jonn snow and daenerys threads have been the weakest taken as a whole but its still blown nearly every other tv show out of the water for me tywinarya  superb tyrionvarysbron  a joy to watch cersei  a superb added dimension to the book portrayal joffrey  he does menace sooo well its uncanny and i very much hope his actor doesnt get rl people hissing at him in the streets as a result balckwater wasa nearly perfect tv and valar morghulis did a splendid job in wrapping things up there were lots of divergences from the book but mostly understandable and often they added a wonderful extra depth and nuance to the book loved the horse poo outside the throne room  it said everything about tywins confidence and arrogance in his power bring on the third seriesseason "
"34" "SarahHughes" 2012-06-06 " ps meant to say what happened to woof73 i enjoyed hisher contributions much missed the last two episodes "
"35" "SarahHughes" 2012-06-06 " ha oh no hopefully yes i certainly want to infuriated monday night viewers and all "
"36" "Vestrit7" 2012-06-06 " will take your word we know the site of her death but if lyanna did give birth how do we know that the birth and her death happened in the same place is this just supposition it is supposition based on the widelyheld belief that it was giving birth that killed lyanna and thus the site of the birth also being the site of her death the main source for this is neds flashbacks referring to her dying in a bed soaked with blood i would go into more detail here but thinking of the possibility that the shows producers may return to this subject in later seasons and maybe film some of the relevant scenes and of posters complaints about people talking books rather than show ad nauseum i think ill leave it there yes there is one other character who knows what happened and as you say he hasnt appeared on the telly yet far out if i spent half as much time working on my own stuff as chatting about pedantic points of the history of westeros i might actually get something published as always good chatting to you hurry up and make up more songs "
"37" "JamesWMoar" 2012-06-06 " legend has it that when james ellroy submitted a draft of one of his early novels his publishers told him to cut it back significantly ellroy being ellroy and not wanting to compromise the plot he simply deleted all the adjectives and adverbs and thus his stripped back modernnoir style was born white jazz is the book its very much less conventional in style than la confidental before it "
"38" "5432Hun" 2012-06-06 " just wait until they all find out that it really was your decision to post the blog on sunday nights and that calling random irish actors brits was a deliberate insult     will you definitely be back next seriesseason "
"39" "SarahHughes" 2012-06-06 " thank you for your lovely post  ive never been anyones favourite critic before either so youve made my day "
"40" "DanielBurden" 2012-06-06 " well as you quite clearly see in the season finale littlefinger says he intends to help sansa and tyrion has done his best to help her before so no i dont really see any spoilers "
"41" "RobertinLondon" 2012-06-06 " thats full of spoilers cant you see that "
"42" "DanielBurden" 2012-06-06 " given what will happen ive read the books and posting no spoilers kings landing is the best place for sansa to be right now the hound might well have looked after her protected her but only while it serves his purpose he might have saved sansa but dont mistake that for loyalty or honour because he has neither the only two people who will ever be in a position to help sansa are tyrion and littlefinger but ultimately both will place her in even greater danger "
"43" "vk1980" 2012-06-06 " you know what it will as well "
"44" "ManofConstantSorrow" 2012-06-06 " remind me again how well staying has played out for her thus far apart from tyrion who is so far removed from power at the moment its dangerous to be seen with him she now has no friends left in kings landing and once word reaches the lannisters that jaimie is out and about she has no further use as far as cersei or tywin are concerned besides i didnt say either choice was attractive just that the one she made doesnt look very good at the moment "
"45" "TheFatCaptain" 2012-06-06 " i seem to be in a tiny minority as someone who thought the look of the white walker was pretty cool i like that heit was pretty strange and alien it fits my expectation of them as an unknown wild force and gave the finale a bit of a kick that just having a hooded figure would not have provided and again i enjoyed the dany storyline the warlock said that the dragons gave him his magic back  so theres clearly a link and its quite reasonable that he was vulnerable to their magicbased flame in a way that he was not to jorahs blade id further suggest that he simply underestimated the dragons and their love for dany theyd never breathed fire like that before but when it came to protecting their mother they took a leap forward in their development as to what he was planning on doing when they got bigger eryeah silly warlock perhaps he imagined his powers would also grow in conjunction and he could use them to control the beasties "
"46" "5432Hun" 2012-06-06 " indeed what sansa knows about sandor is 1 face burned by brother 2 likes killing more than anything else 3 loyalty apparently somewhat malleable4 claims he wont hurt her 5 scary older guy who really really fancies her6 likely to be very high on the list of people that the victors of the battle want to have a little word with whoever wins7 offering to take her on a trip right through the middle of a massive war zone its not a very promising scenario whichever way you look at it "
"47" "DanielBurden" 2012-06-06 " exactly and considering the little adventures the hound goes on in the books "
"48" "TAFKAJamie" 2012-06-06 " indeed what sansa knows about sandor is 1 face burned by brother 2 likes killing more than anything else 3 loyalty apparently somewhat malleable4 claims he wont hurt her you wouldnt take a sweetie off the guy much less let him accompany you anywhere surely "
"49" "DanielBurden" 2012-06-06 " i dont think going with the hound would have served sansa very well in the long run "
"50" "5432Hun" 2012-06-06 " i agree that pycelle wouldnt have been present i disagree that we dont know where lyanna gave birth if she did give birth flashbacks shortly before neds execution clearly give the site of lyannas death i cant sufficiently remember book 1 but will take your word we know the site of her death but if lyanna did give birth how do we know that the birth and her death happened in the same place is this just supposition even if the two events were a mere couple of days apart she could have travelled in between theres one other character who probably knows the truth about jon i think but their family has not yet been introduced in the tv series so no more on that for now its likely there would also have been attendants loyal to ned or maybe silent sisters who would not have talked about it i dont believe anyone else of significance such as was suggested pyscelle could know otherwise it would be all over westeros either way i dont believe sam is anything to do with any of it "
"51" "DanielBurden" 2012-06-06 " there are changes from the books some things have happened earlier and out of order some new bits that didnt really work but ultimately the differences werent so massive as to be an issue "
"52" "Vestrit7" 2012-06-06 " with the exception of ned pretty much everybody who would have known about lyanna giving birth was killed actually im wrong ned had an ally with him who is still alive "
"53" "Vestrit7" 2012-06-06 " moderators  i have taken care in my post above to not spoil and to only use material from the books that have already been covered in the tv show however if there are complaints from other posters or you feel that my post above is a spoiler then please delete it "
"54" "Vestrit7" 2012-06-06 " my respond button isnt working to robertinlondon  as 5432hun says its a difficult discussion to have without possibly spoiling things that said everything im about to type is covered in book one which was season one although a lot of it didnt make it to screen and wont now because it is covered in flashbacks by nedi agree that pycelle wouldnt have been present i disagree that we dont know where lyanna gave birth if she did give birth flashbacks shortly before neds execution clearly give the site of lyannas death there was also little chance of associated rumours about twins or anything else spreading  with the exception of ned pretty much everybody who would have known about lyanna giving birth was killed rhaegar died at the trident and his kingsguard died at the tower of joy shortly after the alleged birth so if lyanna did give birth which i believe and sam is jons twin which i 100 dont believe ned would have been the only person to have known either fact unless there is a nurse or handmaiden we dont know about there were rumours doing the rounds but about the identity of jons mother not to do with lyanna or twins "
"55" "ManofConstantSorrow" 2012-06-06 " doh missed an entire sentence of dialogue stoopid me in which case yes id agree that loyalty to her friends and family would come before the business of having exciting adventures its a contrast against sansas bad bad choice in not going with the hound "
"56" "5432Hun" 2012-06-06 " b i dont remember her being offered tyhe opportunity in fact she was rather pointedly not offered the opportunity jaqen asks arya to go with him but she says no because she has to find robb and catelyn then he gives her the coin this is consistent with aryas character in my view shes tempted and excited by the prospect of going but is ultimately a little girl who wants to find her family and look after her friends this bit isnt quite so well brought out on tv "
"57" "5432Hun" 2012-06-06 " hmm   getting more difficult to play this game without risking spoilers lets just say that if were right that lyanna gave birth at all we have no idea where this took place and i dont think pycelle could have been present on randyl its not in character for him  even just going on what we know of him from the tv series so far plus i think im safe in saying robert issued a blanket pardon to anyone who accepted the result and wasnt a targaryen after the rebellion however you are of course free to believe whatever theories you like    no matter how barmy  "
"58" "MarSane" 2012-06-06 " the authors blog the inn at the crossroads has a fair few recipes up too theyre pretty easy to follow and the food is damn good im overwhelmed i admit i always more or less skipped over the food parts in asoiaf but there are people out there who take up a challenge when they read one to toptroll feast on "
"59" "ManofConstantSorrow" 2012-06-06 " character motivations have been hard to fathom at times why didnt sansa go with the hound last episode why didnt arya go with jaqen a she put her money on stannis instead of the man who frightens her most next to joffreyb i dont remember her being offered tyhe opportunity in fact she was rather pointedly not offered the opportunity and am i the only one who saw the scene where rob stated trhat any ironborn who surrendered was to be sent home to pyke with the exception of theon who he not suprisingly wants a little word with did i dream it i assume theon was carried off in a sack because even the ironborn werent prepared to hand the little turd over to the starks the burning of winterfell seemed dliberately ambigious to me though it doesnt make much sense that the ironborn did it therefore presumably someone is making a powerplay of their own  and a well timed one given that rob is presumably about to lay down his sword and study war no more "
"60" "5432Hun" 2012-06-06 " as a non book reader i think that the inclusion of a zombie army is far fetched and silly dragons fine giant wolves ok witches pushing it now but fair enough it is fantasy after all black smokey murderous babies bit too much the dead guy coming back to life in season 1 doesnt really make sense or fit but i can over look that but zombie armies zombie armies  noo they have ruined the whole feel of the show each to their own of course if you dont like this sort of thing thats a perfectly valid opinion but im intrigued by the bit in bold above about the dead guy in series 1 coming back to life not making any sense or fitting the prologue of the first episode features wight ie zombies coming back to life and attacking three nights watch then theres repeated references to whats beyond the wall including debate about whether its just wildlings or something more sinister given this context i dont really understand how you conclude that the wight coming back to life and attacking mormant doesnt fit "
"61" "RobertinLondon" 2012-06-06 " they are harder to explain if the delivery nursesgrand maester pycelle saw lyanna give birth which they must have done they might have started some rumours in court once it was known to the realm that ned stark had fathered bastard twins as well so soon after lyannas disappearing ones they are quite rare youve sort of answered your own question i think with the tarly argument they were on the wrong side in the war and randyl would want to protect his own houses interests ned could have told him that he would make sure they received a pardon if he took in one of the orphans he might also have been happy to do so if it was a targaryen heir he was protecting wouldnt want to make him his heir though after he grew up to be a craven i only thought of it this morning now convincing myself it is right haha "
"62" "5432Hun" 2012-06-06 " the rhaegarlyanna theory is pretty much the dominant one about jon id be surprised if its not true the jonsam twins theory falls donw on two points i think there are no spoilers here this is all based on what we know from the tv series first bastard twins are no harder to explain away than just one bastard if ned thought the safest thing was to pass off jon as his bastard then why not twins catelyn wouldnt be happy but at that point ned hardly knows catelyn anyway and shes pretty much already as pissed off as she can be about jon second house tarly sworn to house tyrell fought for the targaryen kings in roberts rebellion ie against the starks why would ned trust one of lyannas bastards to randyl tarly and why would randyl agree to pass him off as his own heir especially given what we know from sam about tarlys rather unenlightened views on matters oif the honour of his house sorry to me it just doesnt fly "

"74" "Tigreat" 2012-06-06 " im sure taverns are full of revisionists claiming theres no such things as dragons  harrenhall was destroyed by wildfire while conspiracy theorists retort those ruins were actually built that way to support targaryen propaganda "
"75" "5432Hun" 2012-06-05 " 300 years since the targaryens conquered westeros as far as the history of westeros goes they really had dragons theres documentary records of them and physical evidence such as the ruin of harrenhall by dragonfire plus skeletons of course "
"76" "5432Hun" 2012-06-05 " i think grrm certainly loses a bit of control of the plot after storm of swords and both ffc and dwd suffer as a result both are better on second reading and i agree with you ffc is a lot better than its given credit for i suppose im agreeing with you if theres a problem its not a prose problem the story is just so massive it might not have hurt to cut back some of the wondering about some of the characters do though but then that would mean other threads have to be curtailed to keep timelines broadly in line slightly ot but related to this legend has it that when james ellroy submitted a draft of one of his early novels his publishers told him to cut it back significantly ellroy being ellroy and not wanting to compromise the plot he simply deleted all the adjectives and adverbs and thus his stripped back modernnoir style was born "
"77" "miapatrick" 2012-06-05 " and thats exactly what i wish for  "
"78" "miapatrick" 2012-06-05 " nephew yeah sorry just spaced thereincidentally how long ago did the targaryens take the thronegiven that this is a world rather like medievallate medieval world but carrying on a long time apparently without the the printing press and all the myths about behind the wall the existence of the wall and the guide without a printing press history is very easy to control and easily warped i keep wondering if the dragons really did just conquer or could they have been needed if people dont really believe in the white walkers and have only dragon skeletons do they really know what went on "
"79" "Agent80" 2012-06-05 " also why are people calling the others and wights white walkers walkers is a term for zombies from walking dead i do not remember seeing it in any soiaf book so far because that is exactly what they are called several times throughout the books which you must not have read wights are dead people raised by the white walkers are another race entirely not difficult to understand "
"80" "Vestrit7" 2012-06-05 " i really hate typing on an ipad "
"81" "Vestrit7" 2012-06-05 " ok what gets me though as i said in my earlier post is that i dont quite get why people are making that criticism because i dont think its valid its certainly true that some of the later books get a bit bogged down and slow but i put that more down to plot problems than overblown prose that said i think a feast for crows is a better book than it gets credit for in man ways its quite concerned with spirituality and a world coming to terms with the damage war does that said i started reading grrm after losing patience with robert jordan so it could be that im just stoked hes not jordan "
"82" "Tigreat" 2012-06-05 " he certainly wasnt the guy on the unhorse who looked at sam unhorse i quite like the sound of that "
"83" "5432Hun" 2012-06-05 " no problem were just talking here on jon snow do you mean danys half brother or nephew the most common fan theory for jons parentage that rhaegar targaryen danys eldest brother either kidnapped and raped or eloped with lyanna stark and ned passed jon off as his own bastard to hide him from roberts vengeance for jon to be danys halfbrother aerys ii would have to be his father or aeryss queen his mother but she is a noncharacter essentially "
"84" "Tigreat" 2012-06-05 " extremely unlikely indeedi can only imagine poor sams terrified but sweet reaction to the news hes the legitimate heir to the crownbut but i cant conquer the country its a nation all i want is to take care of gilly "
"85" "Joemanji" 2012-06-05 " it should be pointed out that white walkers and wight are different benjen stark could no more be a white walker than he could be a dragon or a sheep by the shows internal logic he could be a wight but he certainly wasnt the guy on the unhorse who looked at sam "
"86" "miapatrick" 2012-06-05 " hi i just want to jump back in an reiterate that its only what i would really like wishful thinking and variations on very unlikely but possible rather then a full blown theory and one reason i would like it is because as i said hes not bloody stupid and i like the idea of it turning out that he is the heir him shuddering and wondering off to look at a really interesting area beyond the wall looking at where the first men come from because that kind of thing matters more to him then the frankly uncomfortable looking iron thronemy theory is basically jon snow is danys half brother i find the way the characters have been treated so far quite similar major characters mostly in isolation from the rest of the action with their own semiminor characters around them involved in storylines that would more or less vanish if their characters were killed off jons beyond the wall ice dany has dragons fire they are both cut off from their families making their own relationships and thats the way i think it would go but i love sam and the idea of the slap in the face to all the devious bastards with their various shaky claims to the throne of meeting someone with a solid claim who would want nothing to do with it thats what i meant by wishful thinking "
"87" "mrkris" 2012-06-05 "  toptroll oh aye yeah forgot that fair point weewilkie oh aye yeah forgot that too fair point im actually a weewilkie too im called wilkinson and im only little i dont get why when planning his escape jaime didnt say to his cousin you want to help theres only one thing you must do play dead surely he could just pretended to kill him there is i think 1 slight flaw with the first 2 seasons as yet brian blessed has yet to be cast in any role surely this is some oversight that will be rectified next season i want to see him get off a horse and yell or tear a goose limb to limb while laughing heartily anywhere would do a lord of westeros a wildman chief maybe some exotic merchant in bravos or pentos i think this show is crying out for that "
"88" "boleyngroupie" 2012-06-05 " no i wouldnt say that im criticizing i believe i just said that heard his writing is as such many posters here and elsewhere have commented on his long descriptions resulting in boring reading i was responding to that really personally i dont like excessively long books which usually have this type of excessive decriptions but as i also said maybe i will try to read the first book i may love it i dont know my personality is short and sweet cut to the chase so ill set my expectations low if i decide to read it i do like these types of stories however which lured me to watch the series but i liked season 1 better "
"89" "JoeGillis" 2012-06-05 " and if this were an american newspaper website calling it season would be understandable but its not are you fucking kidding there are brits americans and no doubt other nationalities on this board how about you stop being such a fucking snob and let americans call it a season and you know what well let you call it a series and well do so without bitching about it "

"93" "Vestrit7" 2012-06-05 " fair enough no offence taken i hope not sure what randyl looks like just read sections of affc and hes not described but i always imagine him as hard and lean but yhats mainly cos hes such a hard bstard "
"94" "DiamondDag" 2012-06-05 " wait even if they hadnt shown the dragon breathing fire right up until the point it burns the warlock it wouldnt be deus ex machina i mean its a dragon being burned alive by a dragon isnt really a plot contrivance now if jorah suddenly started breathing fire "

"99" "Vestrit7" 2012-06-05 " so youre criticising the writing of the books but yet you havent actually read them personally i dont see the criticism of grrms writing as overblown des rip tons of what everyones wearing as valid people might be getting mixed up with robert jordan who never let the prospect of some action occurring get in the way of describing every button on every single bloody persins shirt he once spent two pages describing someone having a bath which wouldnt have been so bad if it hadnt also been the closest thing to there being any action happenning in a 800page book believe me nothing grrm writes is ever as bad as that as one person has commented though the one thin that grrm does describe lovingly is food and reading his books can make you very hungry not just asoiaf either  fevre dream had me ravenous with some of the food in it "

"104" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-06-05 " rob wouldnt marry the frey girl because he was petulant and angry at mummy for using him as a pawn  he was petulant and angry when the agreement was struck so it was debatable if he would honor it frankly in the episode it seemed as if he married her to get back at catelyn  always a great reason to marry lets face it its not like he wasnt getting the milk for free already no need to buy the cow i didnt think he was petulant and angry when the agreement was struck  he could have refused after all i think he was petulant and angry about catelyns releasing jaime that hed just had enough also as he said he made the deal about the bridge as part of the effort to rescue his father after neds death its understandable that robb would have felt increasingly bitter about the uselessness of his sacrifice he was pretty clear  before getting the milk  that he didnt want to marry the frey girl "

"144" "DiamondDag" 2012-06-05 " well the show isnt really becoming something else it could only ever be this the problem is one that i was worried about from the start in that hbo sold it as sopranos with swords or some other nonsense when the fact is its still a fantasy series i can understand they needed to get a broad audience on board and it does seem to have worked i think im right in saying the ratings for series 2 have been higher than series 1 anyway im not saying its suddenly going to turn into wizards that look like merlin and elves running about but it is a fantasy story and theres more of it to come trying to kid people who have no interest in fantasy that its unimportant to the story is just disingenuous and will only lead to further disappointment down the road of course the producers might chose to lessen those parts further into the story to try and keep a broader audience watching as for the shape shifter thing well its a story "
"145" "ciwstudent" 2012-06-05 " i have really enjoyed this series despite the deviations from the books however after the last scene i wont be able to take the white walkers seriously  they look too much like iron maidens mascot eddie "
"146" "sinders" 2012-06-05 " whereas the first ahem season was truly gripping ive found the 2nd to be a right old mess albeit with a fair few cracking moments i havent read the books no intention to but i think its apparent that there should have been some serious editing going on to get it into a cohesive tv show far too much crammed in and a lot of it didnt make sense as has already been noted im not into the fantasy genre at all so im disappointed that after a rollicking first season with only a hint of all that stuff that the show is becoming something else one question regarding the fantasy element out of many thatve annoyed me before i bow out why didnt the shapeshifter just do his shapeshifting thing and dodge the fire from the dragons when it was obvious what was going to happen if i were in front of a baby dragon thats coughing smoke id be out of there pronto "

"159" "miapatrick" 2012-06-05 " but ran to fat later difference in environment but fair pointand i dont think he ever would be king as well as being unusually nice for a got character hes also unusually not bloody stupid hence the corporal carrot chain of thought plus hes barred from succession via his vows as is jon snow admittedlyand he is handsome and if slimmer would look a bit like renlyanyway the wishful thinking part is that he would turn out to be the true heir not that he would ever ascend the throne frankly i think the person with dragons always gets the throne especially with all the nasteys coming over the wall "
"160" "DrQuinzel" 2012-06-05 " just because noone else has mentioned it can i just say that i blubbed during the tyrion and shae scene in fact tyrions scenes were just so sad betrayed and abandoned by his family with only varys thanking him for saving kings landing but he has the love of a good woman the moment where he realises that shae really does love him and isnt just lying to him was heartbreaking its the only time hes ever been loved in his life itll be very interesting to see where he goes next series  no doubt hell be back on top in no time and i agree with some others  shae has really grown on me wee little rickon was good in this episode wasnt he looks like weve got another brilliant little stark actor as a nonbookreader the structure of this series and imbalance of screentime has affected my perceptions of certain characters the book readers on here seem to love stannis but i found him utterly boring i rooted against him in blackwater because having joffrey on the throne would be infinitely more entertaining than having him on the throne even if joffrey is undeniably the worst king ever i never rooted for renly either although i preferred him to stannis or dany by giving more screentime  and better scenes  to the fascinating lannisters the showrunners may have accidentally shifted audience sympathies to them having said that i do back the starks over the lannisters but as far as im concerned the rest are uninteresting andor superfluous i get the impression thats not what the showrunners want me to think as for the increasing supernatural elements  ive always been a scififantasy fan so the idea of zombies and magic is nothing new to me and something i accept comfortably but the showrunners dont seem to have been entirely successful in introducing those elements believably in the fabric of the show they still stick out like a sore thumb except around dany because of the exotic locale shes in the dragons seem perfectly in place but melisandre just seems like shes wandered in from another show altogether "
"161" "MarSane" 2012-06-05 " my main justification is that he just seems so much more significant then he would be as just jons good friend but then a lot of minor characters here are very well drawnso very very unlikely but not impossible and hes the only character there who even remotely resembles the dead king physically im not sure if they mentioned it on tv but in the books the characters go on about how king robert looked very handsome and slim as a young man his likeness to renly or vice versa is mentioned all the time so no sam does not look like robert still sam is very likable absolutely nice why destroy him by making him yet another king "
"162" "5432Hun" 2012-06-05 " though i hate to break it to you my dear but nobody real looks like dany  just one of the many reasons why fiction is better than real life "

"192" "ACertainBang" 2012-06-05 " is it right that the next book will be split over two seasons like autumn and spring salt and pepper if so this gives me confidence that the producers are making the right decisions to get the story to work on telly even if it means the fans will age another year as a result the winterfell situation confused me too as ever ill have to rewatch but after thinking about it all the clues were there other commenters have mentioned that roose bolton was to let all iron islanders know they could go free if they gave up theon which they appeared to do what happens next is less clear but as theon said to leuwin an iron islander cant be seen to run so the rest of theons crew has had to burn down winterfell before surrendering theon to save something of their reputations this may have risked their free passage home but it makes more sense than the bastard of bolton doing the burning theon will then have told the northerners either that bran and rickon escaped or that he burnt them in either case they have an excuse not to hang around an empty and smoking winterfell ill really miss the tyrion  varys dynamic next year the half man was the only character able to get varys comfortable enough to drop his facade which was fascinating to watch ill miss the blog too see you next year  season  cereal "

"263" "candylilacs" 2012-06-04 " loved the daenarys dreamscape and would have enjoyed if they had put all her material in a tight 20 minutes of the episode rather than spreading 90 seconds on her for the last four episodes still the snowy kings landing palace and her almost touch of the iron throne her time with drogo and her rather fat couldhavebeen baby it was as if she was saying goodbye as if there was a little of him there but she knew it was all a fantasy not real and the sounds of the dragons through it all sounding not unlike the screaming of a baby her three babies she still heard it through the fantasies and remembered why she was there as for the snow and the iron throne i think that has to do with the winter coming theme robb is a petulant idiot boy he only married girlfromnowhere to show his mother who was boss a great idea instead of a politically advantageous marriage lets marry a nobody who no one else likes sounds great robb keep that great political head on your shoulders as for tyrion doesnt he know hes not much better at the game than sansa and you had to love ser loras telling joffrey of his sisters innocence as shes wearing a dress best suited to a kings landing brothel  in fact wasnt the prostitute on bronn wearing a similar dress last episode cersei doesnt even begin to understand margaerys ambition yet as for the white walkers  lets hope for better cgi and why do the zombies not have blue eyes anymore when they did in the first season continuity error i think as for winterfell  it seemed to me that the iron islanders conked theon on the head to ransom their safety and seemed to have that idea in their heads for a bit they might have set everything on fire so no one got anything they didnt they kind of had that mentality as for the books a lot of this series was different so it is like looking at a different interpretation i still love daenarys and next season will be very very interesting  but hopefully not without a hokey sweeping aerial shot two out of two finales is a bit repetitive guys "
"264" "singist" 2012-06-04 " the house of the undying sequence the purpose of the kal drogo and son illusion was obvious but what of the derelict snowbound iron throne room that was intriguing is this what awaits dany when she ultimately reaches westoros i was really looking forward to the house of the undying sequence and though theyd stripped out a lot of visions what they did show seems both intriguing and open to speculation the ruined wintery throne room implies that what she covets  her dominion over the seven kingdoms  will not be possiblemaybe that she will get there too late the others beat her to it and the second vision she goes beyond the wall and finds a tent that contains her husband and son surely it is relevant that she goes beyond the wall to see this her husband and son are dead and increasingly beyond the wall signifies the dead id like to think that whilst the show runners have dropped some balls by condensing all the mystery and foreshadowing of the book visions in the house of the undying that what they have shown us is still a riddle worth speculating about i really dont get why robb and medicine woman were married under the 7 though he follows the old gods and isnt she supposed to be from essos "

"281" "DiamondDag" 2012-06-04 " really strong finish to a series that disappointed me in many ways i think sarah is absolutely right in pointing out how the writers didnt quite get a grasp on which stories to put front and centre and which ones to use sparingly dany and jon are the obvious examples of two stories that were frankly given too much time or written in a way that sent them going around in circles thankfully i think they finished danys story really well i liked what they did with the house of the undying all the prophecies from the books would have been too much so using the visions as a way of pushing dany forwards was well done i still think dany needed to go through that stage of learning that seems to have set a lot of viewers against her but then again everyone will have different feelings about characters jon on the other hand hasnt really been handled well this series i think they dithered for too long and then didnt really leave enough time to give his and qhorins sacrifice a bit more impact again with jon you could say that his stupid actions are just down to youth and this is part of his characters growth but its still strange for me to see jon portrayed as such a fool going to be really interesting to see where he goes next series on the white walkers i have to say i didnt think they looked that bad stuff like that never looks how you imagine it although considering the ever present budget concerns i was surprised they didnt go for a less is more approach they even introduced a blizzard to hide them in silly people from the other commenters it sounds like the burning of winterfell and the fate of the ironborn has left some confused i suppose its a case of waiting until series 3 for answers a goodbye to donald sumpter then who along with a lot of other secondary characters consistently stole the show from the supposed bigger names the way they have used osha in that story has been great another character beefed up from the books and better for it erm this is getting stupidly long so varys was one of my favourite things from this entire series loved the look on jaimies face when brienne finally showed him why he should probably keep his mouth shut jaqen changing his face made me grin like an idiot and margaerys clothes well dont the highborn women usually follow the fashion of the queen hmmm so more grumbles than series 1 but im still really excited to keep watching this thing unfold "

"284" "writersden" 2012-06-04 " it can work both ways i find myself thinking of british shows like doctor who as divided into series instead of seasons maybe because i read most of the coverage about them in nonus papers but i have seen a few american newspapersmagazinesblogs referring to series 2 of sherlock new york magazine is one in reference to its airing in the us thats not to say british papers shouldnt use british terms but there are some expressions filtering in the other way too game of thrones and other programs are collaborative efforts so maybe the journalists just go by how hbo or the bbc or whichever channel originally commissioned the program in question refers to it all that saidloved the seasonseries and already looking forward to next spring the finale was ok not sure how they could have done much better given the fact that there were so many characters to track though the siege of winterfell was a bit needlessly confusing my guess is that the men delivered theon to the starks and packed up and sailed home under the promise of amnesty but it doesnt quite click so the stark men let the pike people raze the castle or were they just waiting around for the pike men to finish up whatever they were doing there and give them theon and they all just seemed to go home by the time bran and friends emerged "
"285" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-06-04 " okay i have to give it to alfie allen good acting ive gone too far to pretend to be anything else captured the realization and the sheer hopelessness of the situation pity cleftjaw didnt feel so brave we may have to wait a little longer to see the head of theon greyjoy rollhavent read the books but didnt really feel that the house of the undying was so spooky pyat pree looked rather stupid couldnt he just disapparate after being shot by fire also a wiser man would have bound the dragons mouths "
"286" "WillieMillerisGod" 2012-06-04 " read the books "
"287" "ntofr1" 2012-06-04 " i think weve had 2 pretty damn fine sereasons and for the most part i think the compromises are probably justified sound sure of that dont i ill hopefully have finished all the books by seasies 3 after which i will be happy to enjoy this as an adaptation faults and all "
"288" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-06-04 " you are cruel very cruel samwise gamgee may yet return back from mordor to rosie "
"289" "Kyle1982" 2012-06-04 " it should indeed be programmes but i was once lied to regarding the use of programprogramme a while ago and occasionally confuse the two damned that lying fool i do know its an american show yes but i fail to see why we alternate terminology in favour of our own i dont remember going to the bibliotheque in france in 1996 i just become annoyed at the overuse of americanisms season and prom i know people to say highway series is season as we do not use season at all so for example this is game of thrones series 2 i understand the encompassing use of the word series say when referring to the sopranos and using season for any one run in any one year but its just never been like that here slab certainly isnt used generally and i was just throwing it in as i couldnt be bothered thinking of another word to use "
"290" "MalarkeyMan" 2012-06-04 " the dragons aside there isnt that much fantasy in the books all the major story arcs are character driven  with fantasy as a backdrop i read short letter by raymon chandler the other day in which he describes the important bit of storytelling a long time ago when i was writing for the pulps i put into a story a line like he got out of the car and walked across the sundrenched sidewalk until the shadow of the awning over the entrance fell across his face like the touch of cool water they took it out when they published the story their readers didnt appreciate this sort of thing just held up the action and i set out to prove them wrong my theory was that they just thought they cared nothing about anything but the action that really although they didnt know it they cared very little about the action the things they really cared about and that i cared about were the creation of emotion through dialogue and description the things they remembered that haunted them were not for example that a man got killed but that in the moment of his death he was trying to pick a paper clip up off the polished surface of a desk and it kept slipping away from him so that there was a look of strain on his face and his mouth was half opened in a kind of tormented grin and the last thing in the world he thought about was death he didnt even hear death knock on the door that damn paper clip kept slipping away from his fingers and he just wouldnt push it to the edge of the desk and catch it as it fell game of thrones is like chandler in that its within a sometime derided genre fiction but like chandler its emotion and character driven and just well written  both series and books "
"291" "Mattox" 2012-06-04 " haha no youre right i guess deus ex machina is the wrong phrase what i more meant was that it felt a little unsatisfying for the undying guy to have gone to all of this trouble putting her and the dragons into this room and not to have factored in that dragons breathe fireperhaps this is just me but when i was watching it and thinking how is dany going to get out of this scrape when the dragons went and burned him down i just thought oh "
"292" "ntofr1" 2012-06-04 " youre right it would be nice if they stuck more closely to the books but i doubt a truly faithful adaptation would be possible until all the books were read and fully understood and or hbo upped the budget and were willing to risk less profit theres always a compromise with these things and im willing to give the benefit of the doubt "
"293" "Joemanji" 2012-06-04 " im now worried that a series which has great dialogue and characters is now going to spend oodles of dollars on special effects and cgi to be fair to the book that scene with the undead army is shown in a lot more detail than in the books if they remained true to the books they could probably have used no cgi at all generally i wouldnt worry the magical and supernatural always plays a distant second fiddle to the scheming and politics "
"294" "JimTheFish" 2012-06-04 " i think season is fine pretty sure each years dr who back in the old days was described as a season "
"295" "smilerone" 2012-06-04 " the spooky arrival of the undead army at the end upped the magic stakes considerably and its possible that those who loved the show for its internecine politics and power plays may be less happy with the growing magical element agreed ive never read the books and now between the dragons the witch and walking dead im now worried that a series which has great dialogue and characters is now going to spend oodles of dollars on special effects and cgi i hope im proved wrong and yes what on earth happened at winterfell still i eagerly await the third seasonseries "
"296" "TodayIamtheZodiac" 2012-06-04 " my biggest problem with the show is i just couldnt care less about any of the characters or about who ends up on that bloody throne i mean there are a few that are pretty entertaining but if any of them got killed off i doubt id care theres a lot of bland actors on there too which doesnt help on the other hand im currently watching the sopranos again for the first time since it ended and all those things that bugged or frustrated me the first time around things i thought never worked or were just plain boring play so much better when im watching it on dvd at my own pace so maybe thats how got needs to be seen tvs changed man "
"297" "londonhongkong" 2012-06-04 " i thought the last episode was pretty damned good as has been the season as a whole many changes from the books but thats to be expected to keep pacing and storylines together cant say i particularly liked the look of the white walker but thats the thing with fantasy books we all have our own picture of what weve read and others realisations of it sometimes dont match im sure ill live with it ok though i liked the depiction at the beginning of season 1 much better "
"298" "MZorin" 2012-06-04 " i really enjoyed the handmaiden trying to get off the hook handmaiden please khaleesi he said youd never leave qarth alivedany oh thats ok then you can live or ill lock you in a vault "
"299" "Joemanji" 2012-06-04 " dd have said logistically they cannot run to more than 10 episodes per season regardless of budgetary constraints not sure how true that is  if other shows can do 2224 surely got can stretch to 12 maybe the locations stretching all over europe are the difference "
"300" "weewilkie" 2012-06-04 " i was completely with you until the bit about the production designer being a woman thats sexist so ill fix it for you i am happy to see that the production designer is clearly shit hot at their job "
"301" "SarahHughes" 2012-06-04 " ooh good call about them using theon to trade their safety i didnt think of that agreed that whichever northern lord was hanging around to raze the place is indeed probably suspect "
"302" "SarahHughes" 2012-06-04 " i agree with you about increasing the length this is a show that would have benefited from being 1213 episodes although i understand that its not in part because of costs filming issues etc that said im hopeful that by splitting book 3 my favourite as i may have mentioned in half theyll do it justice "
"303" "mironovna" 2012-06-04 " a word for the incredible production values and locations the logistics of the creation of a series like this must be horrendous brilliant work by all concerned especially designers camera and ads i am happy to see that the production designer is a woman "
"304" "SarahHughes" 2012-06-04 " here in pedants corner i am going to answer you re seasonseries i would generally say series but i have a pathological hatred of having to use the same word twice in a sentence or nearby that word so if ive already said series then im likely to say season next the same applies to programme and show although when i worked for the tv desk of the observer i did once get a fantastically angry letter informing me that show referred to the west end and only the west end and would i please remember that in future i also feel that it might work better if i watch the whole thing through again in fact being a bit nerdy im rather looking forward to that "
"305" "CharlieBronze" 2012-06-04 " good to see ros back on her back again nice of cersei to let her go just like that the house of the undying sequence the purpose of the kal drogo and son illusion was obvious but what of the derelict snowbound iron throne room that was intriguing is this what awaits dany when she ultimately reaches westoros littlefinger going geoff shreeves on sansa so sansa now that youre free of the obligation to marry joffrey you do know hes still going to beat and fuck you dont you why couldnt rob still marry the frey girl as agreed and have his little bit of exotica on the side he is a king after all and kings do tend to bend the rules a little definitely a chip of the old block the undead army at the end spooky yes but probably easy to outmanoeuvre in fact whoever came up with the idea of a wall in the first place probably didnt lose too much sleep over them "
"306" "Fulton" 2012-06-04 " surely it was a moment of gross stupidity my baldy to put daenerys with her dragons i know i immediately thought you dont seem to have entirely thought this through i mean what happens when the dragons start to grow found the tower business all a bit anticlimactic to be honest i wonder if the show would be better served by spending more time in a particular episode in just one or maybe two places with a smaller number of characters seen per episode rather than jumping around all the time i felt like the blackwater episode last week was the best because it didnt have that sense of wildly jumping around so we could have our two minute catchup with whatever jon snowdanerysarya are doing this week i feel like a solid half hour spent with jon snow and cos storyline or whatever as opposed to the sudden jumping in and out for five minutes an episode might make things feel a bit more cohesive "
"307" "MZorin" 2012-06-04 " i too am confused by the razing of winterfell why do the stark boys have to go on the run arent they in friendly territory "
"308" "MZorin" 2012-06-04 " you do know this is an american show right produced for an american network i know all the pseudobrit accents and scenery on the screen are confusing and if this were an american newspaper website calling it season would be understandable but its not "
"309" "documental" 2012-06-04 " oi shouldnt that be television programmes then  you do know this is an american show right produced for an american network i know all the pseudobrit accents and scenery on the screen are confusing also explain this to me in the uk a series refers to one yearly run of a show do you not differentiate between a series which in america refers to the full run of a show from first to very last episode and a season which refers to one year of a show though generally not a full year if so how i hope your word slab is not the standard term "
"310" "CharlieBronze" 2012-06-04 " another question is why did bran  rickon not reveal themselves to the northmen once they had taken control of the castle yeah that doesnt make any sense at all and by omitting ramsey bolton from this series theyve really muddled things the sacking of winterfell is not a mystery that the showrunners can use to keep viewers guessing its just another thing that has been cherrypicked from the text but has happened here without considered explanation oh yeah the castles burnt down too best show that its a great television show that could be greater still if the accountants werent making the editorial decisions i guess it has to be viewed as a separate entity because it has been far from a faithful adaptation "
"311" "Kyle1982" 2012-06-04 " id like it called series as it is the word often used for television programs here its like how kids now call their end of year disco prom and hire limos and dump their newly born babies in skips like they do in america luckily for me i finished the first slab of episodes and jumped straight into the remaining books from a clash of kings onwards i finished a dance with dragons in a kind of fuzzy state after binging on the lot over the course of a couple of months nowthe wait begins "
"312" "TodayIamtheZodiac" 2012-06-04 " i cant even spell because "
"313" "TodayIamtheZodiac" 2012-06-04 " im the king no im the king where are my dragons you will do what i say beacuse i used to be on fire boobs chop "
"314" "ericbforpm" 2012-06-04 " agreed but still surely it was a moment of gross stupidity my baldy to put daenerys with her dragons even if they were at that point without fire fantastic episode feel very guilty for spending the whole series whinging about the dragon lady yet at the same time have a funny feeling the next series will involve her slowly assembling her army by shouting at one soldier at a time "
"315" "documental" 2012-06-04 " ok i missed that stannis was dragged off by his own men in the big battle episode it still stretches credulity though his troops were being slaughtered or captured by tywins forces the battle was lost and stannis was actually inside the walls of the city singlehandedly trying to kill joffreys army so how would you imagine he and his men escaped to safety to what the unnoticed row boat they had stashed somewhere one could concoct all kinds of schemes magical or otherwise but to me it defies basic logic then again it wouldnt be the first case of that in this series "
"316" "JimTheFish" 2012-06-04 " agreed its rapidly becoming one of the most misused phrases on cif "
"317" "Joemanji" 2012-06-04 " i thought the white walkers in the very first scene of the very first episode looked great no cgi needed or just the eyes at least would have been more spooky to have him robed and cowled and turn round to sam to reveal those eyes "
"318" "Spacedone" 2012-06-04 " exactly how old are you "
"319" "Spacedone" 2012-06-04 " us tv critic maureen ryan has compared brienne to the wires omar brienne coming brienne coming that undead guy on horseback looked wank that was a white walker i think that for any future glimpses and im guessing from that army well be seeing them again soon the producers should make use of the blizzard conditions to hide them as much as possible or up the cgi budget i can see why people thing that this season has been slightly flawed the sheer number of storylines going on do seem to be getting truncated a bit by being squeezed into 10 episodes this has led to some parts of the plot appearing a little more suddenly than they do in the books i think they should increase it to 12 or 13 episodes a season so they can afford to leave in some of the connecting scenes and dont leave people scratching their heads for explanations having said that ive enjoyed this season quite a lot hopefully the ratings will convince hbo to keep backing it "
"320" "Sinequanone" 2012-06-04 " i dont think after this season we can really look to the books for too much detail about what the tv program makers wil be doing i am a non book person  altho ive been dipping in and out of book two retrospectively as its gone on "
"321" "Fulton" 2012-06-04 " when i were a lad we always said if a girl hits you on the head with a sword like that it means she likes you "
"322" "EddieLarkin" 2012-06-04 " nonspoiler explanation of the winterfell situation i believe it was episode 8 when lord bolton was talking about the retaking of winterfell with robb he informs him his bastard son is on the way with a force of men these are the dudes outside the walls in episode 10 robb has bolton inform his bastard that any ironborn who willingly surrender are to be allowed to the return to the iron isles obviously chris finch and the other ironborn have been made aware of this offer by the bastard and thus they betray theon and hand him over so why is winterfell a smoldering wreck a few hours later the ironborn may be responsible but this would surely endanger their terms of surrender to the northmen this wont be made completely clear until i predict the end of season 3 another question is why did bran  rickon not reveal themselves to the northmen once they had taken control of the castle unfortunately this question will likely never be made clear by the show due to some really dumb changes to the book made by the writers if you want to know the ins and outs of everything youll have to read the books "
"323" "AndyMitchell" 2012-06-04 " this series leaves me looking forward to the next in some ways it was not as good as the first being somewhat of a transitional series after the first set the stage but it has opened up so many different storylines and possibilities that has got my imagination flowing i love that characters have been given time to develop arya for example has become my favourite character now that we have been given the time to get to know her a bit better i dont like that the series only has 10 episodes i feel a bit shortchanged when we are used to 2024 for other genres maybe i have been overindulged and grown used to it but there you go i think i will start reading the books to fill my time before the third ser season perhaps then i can comment with the same righteous highmindedness of those who know the original story "
"324" "sharpeiboy" 2012-06-04 " what would you call them instead of seasons just asking you should have been one of those thousands who had to wait for the latest book to come out a year is nothing in comparison "
"325" "Joemanji" 2012-06-04 " indeed robb marrying by the seven rather than the old gods of the north was interesting "
"326" "iDiscuss" 2012-06-04 " oh robb forsaking your oaths and getting married by the seven where did you go wrongspeaking of going wrong doreah  "
"327" "guardiansek" 2012-06-04 " it was a good season but i am still considering whether it was better than season one sarah hughes is right about danys complaining about her birthright for the first 9 episodes of this year or at least since she got to qarth this season also she is right about the effects of not killing the young stark boys regarding theons humiliation i figured that the ironborn bagged up their leader to trade him for their safe passage back home who knows what happens to theon next season but whoever is now ruling over winterfell seems to be enough of a nihilist that he burned the place down when he captured it so the degree of loyalty they have to robb stark and the niceties of social decorum seems a bit suspect so no more well played support from maester luwin but i am a bit more concerned about bronn potentially moving on since he is no longer needed to run the goldcloaks now that his patron tyrion is demoted and i guess no more joqen hghar probably not spelling that right they respectively added some deadpan humor and mystery to the series "
"328" "sharpeiboy" 2012-06-04 " much of this season has been very distant from the books  apart from such events as the battle last week which is good for those people who are fussed about spoilers a real contrast with season 1 which followed the books pretty closely its almost as though grrm had written a totally new work at least that is some explanation of why he took years in writing his latest volume since the warlock seems to be able to dematerialise and form copies of himself why succomb to that dragonfire i was waiting for visions in the house of the undying but they were missing  we got 2 new ones cant have stretched the budget that much "
"329" "Kyle1982" 2012-06-04 " so after watching this weekbyweek and feeling its not as up to scratch as last years series i have started watching it in bulk as a rerun i went through four episodes last night and i have to say it certainly holds up to last year which was both a surprising and excellent discovery true jon and danys stories arent as wellhoned as they should have been but they really come on in book three so expect to see our laboured fruits next year i watched episode ten this morning and it was brilliant i would have cried throughout the whole thing if id have had a drink or two the ending may send some people into a wwwhat but believe me the magic is rarely interspersed from now until certain points and it really does become a courtroomwesteros drama for the foreseeable future enjoy oh why do people keep calling it season stop it i cant believe we have to wait so long for next year i dont even have the books to entertain me as i read them all between series one and two i suppose ill have to live a real life how appalling stannis is my king "
"330" "weewilkie" 2012-06-04 " in the books only kidding they were stannis own men dragging him away after it became apparent that the battle was lost i enjoyed his homer simpson moment with the red priestess why you little "
"331" "andrewl337" 2012-06-04 " stannis got dragged away by his own men when tywin lannister arrived presumably to safety "
"332" "documental" 2012-06-04 " agreed with those confused as to why winterfell was burned and sacked though it seems to be one of those annoying plot points that people who read the books get i feel the show should be able to flow on its own without viewers having to read the books beforehand  good as they may be and this to me just felt confusing rather than suspenseful another weird point maybe i missed something in the blackwater episode but wasnt stannis overwhelmed and captured as the battle was lost how did he get back to his little flamehaired sorceress so quickly why is he not beheaded or rotting in a kings landing dungeon something got glossed over here and please dont tell me to read the books "
"333" "weewilkie" 2012-06-04 " and i guess the bookies have closed bets on peter dinklage winning best actor emmy "
"334" "maclean3" 2012-06-04 " i have loved this year but didnt really enjoy this ep but i guess its the same feeling i had with the postbaelor episode last year  what could possibly follow last week totally agree about stannis im not a reader of the books but i guess danys story is yet to come and they just cant have her sit about and do nothing for a year  but really feel stannis was underused and of course one of the more interesting aspects of the seasn also hes a complete badass "
"335" "andrewl337" 2012-06-04 " how the hell is a dragon breathing fire deus ex machina fire is an innate ability for dragons "
"336" "weewilkie" 2012-06-04 " i actually quite enjoyed that tweak to the book instead of seeing the future dany had to choose between the throne a family or her dragons a bit the last temptation of daenerys it became about confronting her own destiny i think she backed the right horse  ermm dragon in the end "
"337" "pauldefrance" 2012-06-04 " why did jon kill quorin for example as a nonreader i can assure you that this was well signposted in the previous episode and even in the previously of this one  theyll never trust me they might if you do what needs to be done "
"338" "weewilkie" 2012-06-04 " poor sam the only thing worse would have been a blue eyed gilly walking by in the undead horde waving his mothers thimble at him from a mangled pinky "
"339" "Mattox" 2012-06-04 " agree with your points about the flaws one more minor quibble for me is the ending for dany it felt a little deus ex machina to have the dragon roast the undying man also the scene in the house of the undying missed out on the all the lovely foreshadowing prophecies but i think that is understandable considering the budget "
"340" "Joemanji" 2012-06-04 " some loose ends tied up a few things i dont understand winterfell  what happened there i could say what happened in the book but it looks like that would be a spoiler for events of season 3 "
"341" "pauldefrance" 2012-06-04 " best episode so far perfectly paced multiple storylines neatly put to bed for the next series pretty faultless acting all round cant wait for the next series and thanks for this blog that just adds to it all "
"342" "Joemanji" 2012-06-04 " rather like the finale of season one this episode seemed to set up the next season after the blockbuster events of the previous one game of thrones is at its best when great characters war with words and sometimes seems to struggle with getting the plot over coherently i cant help thinking nonreaders will be confused by many of the event of this episode why did jon kill quorin for example the halfhands goading made it seem as if jon had killed him through another act of petulance whereas in the book the selfsacrifice is much clearer also who burnt winterfell and why did the northmen let the ironborn escape afterwards if it was them danys visions in the house of the undying seemed like cheap reuse of existing sets im not sure if the lack of flashbacks to the war of the ursurper are a decision based on cost alone there should have been some in s1e9 too with ned character motivations have been hard to fathom at times why didnt sansa go with the hound last episode why didnt arya go with jaqen in terms of survival going with a freakin ninja must be better than wandering a warzone with a fat kid and a blacksmith a sad end for maester luwin who lent the winterfell scenes such dignity one fan theory out of the window there  i have to admit i have enjoyed this season a lot less than the first that might be because i knew what was going to happen the parts i have enjoyed most have been deviations from the book eg tywin  arya but the lack of a single driving narrative as with season one is definitely an issue still great telly though and i never failed to tune in at the earliest opportunity "
"343" "Sinequanone" 2012-06-04 " okaaaaaayy some loose ends tied up a few things i dont understand sansa winterfell  what happened there faceless man revealed  arya good stuff poor tyrion brienne and jaime was great scene with his realisation that she is fcking good she is both strong and very quick d finally this was danaerys episode  all the qarth stuff was breathtaking  and the power of the dragons at that size  we can see what they would do to a castle when full grown however  i am not sure what to make of the ending is got going to become a zombie movie a few mixed feelings i need to watch all episodes back to back  "
"344" "BenGipsat" 2012-06-04 " that undead guy on horseback looked wank "
"345" "rlnbvt" 2012-06-04 " great season great finishi just wish we could have seen what stannis saw in the flames and the dragons were excellent "
"346" "MurrayOstril" 2012-06-04 " i loved every second of that right how many sleeps until season 3 then "
