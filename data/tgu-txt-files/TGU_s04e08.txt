"4" "Redable" 2014-06-06 " haha oh yes "
"5" "James Minglis" 2014-06-06 " obeyn being crushed to his chest there is a feeling of him being sort of enveloped repeatedly ramming your fist into their mouth eyes and head until it crunches so not what happened in the show youre the one calling people names and acting like a six year old about it sometimes six year olds call people the right name "
"6" "keef1980" 2014-06-06 " ive not minded littlefingers accent at all until this week  other weeks its been hmm where is he supposed to be from yes i know that theyre not in england but there are cockneys geordies mancs etc as he slipped between weird soundings of words this week though he seemed to suddenly switch to full on thick irish was the first time id laughed at the poor execution of something on the show "
"7" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-06 " yes one that smushes his head maybe more likely with an eight foot tall man the whole passage describes obeyn of being crushed to his chest there is a feeling of him being sort of enveloped having one arm wrapped around someone crushed to your chest with your other arm and repeatedly ramming your fist into their mouth eyes and head until it crunches when you are a near eight foot tall giant wad of muscle is going to reduce that persons head to a pulp like a walnut in a nutcracker ive been civil its just an different reading of the text youre the one calling people names and acting like a six year old about it "
"8" "James Minglis" 2014-06-06 " also as he drew back his huge fist this obviously means another punch next time you act like a douche try to at least be right "
"9" "James Minglis" 2014-06-06 " correct into his eyes which leaves a lot of ambiguity and of course these directors chose the most gruesome option possible smashed not crushed and broken like a watermelon thanks youre done "
"10" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-06 " so how is it you see this being different from the show first he smashed his teeth out  they did that then he pushed his fingers into his eyes they did that too then he smashed his head in with a gross sound which is also what happened "
"11" "jodaki" 2014-06-06 " i love game of thrones but have the same feeling that i had with sins of anarchy a while back its getting a touch formulaic the saving grace being its incredible surprise factor each week but once that is passed its sort of oh it doesnt surprise me that that happened of course ill continue to watch avidly each week "
"12" "James Minglis" 2014-06-06 " “elia of dorne” they all heard ser gregor say when they were close enough to kiss his deep voice boomed within the helm “i killed her screaming whelp” he thrust his free hand into oberyn’s unprotected face pushing steel fingers into his eyes “then i raped her” clegane slammed his fist into the dornishman’s mouth making splinters of his teeth “then i smashed her fucking head in like this” as he drew back his huge fist the blood on his gauntlet seemed to smoke in the cold dawn air there was a sickening crunch ellaria sand wailed in terror and tyrion’s breakfast came boiling back up he found himself retching bacon and sausage and applecakes and that double helping of fried eggs cooked up with onions and fiery dornish peppers he never heard his father speak the words that condemned him perhaps no words were necessary i put my life in the red viper’s hands and he dropped it when he remembered too late that snakes had no hands tyrion began to laugh hysterically "
"13" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-06 " ah i misunderstood you  yes sansa would be a minor sometimes you see teen sex scenes on tv so i dont know quite where that would f it in "
"14" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-06 " none of them are really major  certianly bronn is a sort of third tier character in importance to the story and oberyn was never a major character though one might have thought he was going to be a lot of the fun of bronn was i think because he was a minor character  he could get a lot of funny lines and such because he was in a way outside of the real action of the story "
"15" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-06 " yes i think that is the main goal it was her seductive walk that i found a bit silly though i suppose its what one might expect of a 14 year old trying to look sexy "
"16" "Idil" 2014-06-06 " if he is not doing it intentionally to make a point it may have to do with the nationality of the person directing that episode his accent may change if he is influenced by the accent of the person speaking into his ear "
"17" "realstokebloke" 2014-06-06 " theres no body for syrio though tv wise anyway consoling thought though especially ros "
"18" "realstokebloke" 2014-06-06 " the political nuances have cropped up before ref tywins appropriation of what was widely considered to be the republicans rallying call trust only ourselves i think it was in e5 or 6 bws time at trinity seems also to add a certain credibility love to know if theres anything in it "
"19" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-06 " um yes he crushes his head it is squashed in both cases the only difference is he does it in a hug from the bottom rather than a shove from the top my guess is that having him on top had to do with filming or visual considerations "
"20" "realstokebloke" 2014-06-06 " i never knew inigo montoya was is saul from homeland apols if mentioned in the many pages i havent yet read through good ol mandy "
"21" "ROUcynic" 2014-06-06 " a least he took his cape off "
"22" "CentralBelter" 2014-06-06 " yes that would be a good charitable interpretation but if it was intended theyd have made it explicit at some point and commented on it it would have been good though "
"23" "ROUcynic" 2014-06-06 " give it a chance  bits of it are dead currently "
"24" "ROUcynic" 2014-06-06 " not everyone  happily "
"25" "ROUcynic" 2014-06-06 " he was vanquished  he just managed to kill the viper before he died "
"26" "crehane" 2014-06-06 " youll never guess who i bumped into on grafton street this morning only littlefinger himself aiden bloody gillen i shouldve asked him about the accent but i was too star struck to think of it however i do have my own theory on the matter i reckon that littlefinger is an up jumped social and political climber as such his accent is an affectation in view of this his speech or more specifically his accent sometimes lets him down it also has a tendency to change depending on who hes talking to "
"27" "keef1980" 2014-06-06 " also its been pointed out to me that the hair dying is more about disguising herself red hair would be a giveaway to her being a tully "
"28" "BrandonMP" 2014-06-06 " in the books poisonlaced spear and days after the battle in the show that wasnt made apparent and he could conceivably still be alive although i believe he just bleed out "
"29" "BrandonMP" 2014-06-06 " one of the best things about having read the books first is watching some of the scenes replicated in the show better than your imagination in recent episodes id put the courtroom scene and this battle in that group "
"30" "ACertainBang" 2014-06-06 " the next episode seems like it will be pure wall but i really want to know tyrions fate also what about shireen and pod poor ol stannis grumpychops didnt get much of a look in this season i hope thats nothing to do with woof79 abandoning us "
"31" "James Minglis" 2014-06-06 " no he smashes him in the teeth then puts out his eyes with his fingers then crushes his head against his chest so not the same thing ok "
"32" "trizzer" 2014-06-06 " i call duckorth lewis "
"33" "chriskilby" 2014-06-06 " dont understand all the fuss about littlefingers accent ive always thought he sounds like pierce brosnan "
"34" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " fwiw i pictured him as looking like the guy who played biff in back to the future "
"35" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " fingers and he didnt have that girlfriend he instead used to chase down peasant girls in the woods with a pack of female dogs and rape them and if they have a good chase hed name new dogs after them his torture of theon i thought was just as bad too though obviously not so visual "
"36" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " yes in the book he forced an eldely widow whose land was adjacent to his to marry him then he raped her then he locked her in a tower room until she starved to death apparently having tried to eat her own f "
"37" "Mirthin" 2014-06-05 " hmm i havent had the impression that his sadism was really turned upi actually thought the stuff with the girls in the woods was turned down a bit i cant recall an analogous scene in the books wasnt there something about ramsay marrying an older noblelady for her land and then sicking his dogs on her was that in the second book told to bran when he held court in winterfell one thing i noticed though is he seems a lot less stupid in the show yeah ill agree with that and younger too no i pictured a very different character before his was introduced in the series i always pictured him as potbelled chavy peter sarsgard i dont know why thats just how i saw him one of the problems i have with the tv show is that the characterisations eventually overtake the ones ive created in my minds eye i had very different ideas about what stannis davos and melisandre looked like too but now its gone "
"38" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " if i recall correctly he wasnt saying necessarily that those people were better than him but that they were stronger "
"39" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " yes i agree i think he is a very good man but for him honour is a fairly simple and straightforward thing he doesnt tend to look for a lot of layers to the situation and he isnt interested in or perhaps very able at playing politics "
"40" "Paul Manley" 2014-06-05 " it looked as if part of the combat scene was missing on my recording here california what killed mountain "
"41" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " hmm i thought most of your better characters were worse even when i liked them oberyn seemed much more onedimensional stannis was more onedimensional the hound went from being truly dysfunctional to being a sort of curmudgeon youd like to cuddle jorah went from being a bearlike curmudgeon to a hot sexy guy catleyn though i didnt like her as a person much was i thought a great portrait of a strong good but fatally flawed person on both show and in the books "
"42" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " i think you are right and it is true in the books i actually started reading them not knowing that martin was american and i was surprised when i realized he was he is quite good overall at giving characters of different backgrounds a different voice "
"43" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " as far as i know there is no real question that the show will overtake the books and the producers and martin are all aware of this as you have likely noticed these stories are pretty meticulously plotted out already with things from the very first books only coming to fruition in the latest so i dont think it is likely to be a problem i dont see any reason for book readers to get worried about knowing the ending any more than i think show watchers should be "
"44" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " i wish the books were anywhere near as subtle as the show can be when its not pumping blood and breasts in our faces its natural that a visual media has more scope for visual effects written stories have other strengths which the show sometimes lacks "
"45" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " no they defiantly get rid of the stones dany asks the slavers about it in the book and they say that it is worth it because it makes them more obedient their training and use as massed soldiers make a tendency to less massiveness less important  they are fit in any case the question in the show is now whether they also remove the penis "
"46" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " the whole problem with the meereen scenes is that theres no political intrigue or tension and were left with pointless romance like danydaario and greywormmissandei which is weird because as a reader they were all about political intrigue "
"47" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " i didnt like either daario much and i didnt see much chemistry with either of them but maybe that isnt really down to the boys "
"48" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " i tend to agree people are unfair they forget that as written the character is only 11 in the first book and 13 when she escapes kings landing and her bad decisions are very much in keeping with her age but she does seem to me to be very observant and careful  she really notices for example what makes joff happy and is very detail oriented in general really good with people arya seems pluckier but it would have been a disaster for her if she had to remain in kings landing she is not nearly as observant about people as sansa is she makes a lot of errors about their motivations and who to trust i thought ned should have got the girls away without telling them anything myself and sooner than he planned to "
"49" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " not at all jaimes is very good for a nonenglish speaker and tyrion sounds like a fake englishman fro a 1960s theater production "
"50" "kged" 2014-06-05 " ok in this episode even i could hear littlefingers accent going awry when people have said this previously i have rather dismissed it not having noticed significant problems with his accent myself but he was absolutely all over the place here the speech to young lord robin was 100 brendan obaelish  he sounded like my cousins from ballymun im curious if any american viewers found his accent dodgy in the wire im not competent to pick up on faults in a bawlmer accent "
"51" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " battlefield tactics and duels are not the same at all the reasoning is given clearly in the book where oberyn talks to tyrion the mountains armour is impenetrable by any weapon  it is too thick more so than any normal armour he uses the spear because it gives him the reach he needs and because with its long slender point he can try and slip it into the gaps at the joints "
"52" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " hmm i havent had the impression that his sadism was really turned upi actually thought the stuff with the girls in the woods was turned down a bit one thing i noticed though is he seems a lot less stupid in the show "
"53" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " there are ways around that which is why it is weird to me that mountain 2 didnt seem bulkier you wouldnt have had the shirtless stuff but that was really just eye candy not that i am complaining it is entirely possible to make a lankier person like that seem very large for tv especially in armour "
"54" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " also it would be kind of a silly thing for her to do i think "
"55" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " no she isnt but i think it would be a bit creepy for them to write her a sex scene the moment she is legally able to do one i kind of thought her kissing petyr who the actress has known since she was about 15 was slightly creepy "
"56" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " i thought the spear got him closer to the side than through the heart its described a a wound in his side in the book in any case the point really was that he was strong enough that once he got his hands on oberyn it was game over even if the mountain was already half dead "
"57" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " i dont think we know that yet "
"58" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " no i agree with the others and it is interesting to me that show watchers seem to get the impression that martin kills of everyone you get attached to i didnt feel that way in the stories at all  more like everyone good or bad was fair game just as in life one thing i would say is that the characters that i thought were the most important earlier in the story by this point it was clear to me that that was an error  the ones that will be important are sometimes ones we saw and dismissed at the beginning or in other cases werent introduced to until later and some seem to have stories included for reasons other than we might have thought at first "
"59" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " no he smashes him in the teeth then puts out his eyes with his fingers then crushes his head against his chest pretty much the same except in the book the gregor stays flat on his back the whole time and embraces him like a lover is i think what it says its pretty gruesome "
"60" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-05 " i thought it was a bit over the top "
"61" "Chgorob1" 2014-06-05 " show watcher only here i liked vipers choice of a long spear as his weapon after having shown the importance of weapon choice in his first episode when stabbing a lannister also it is on the martell sigil also i could not help but think that tyrions comment about at least wear a helmet could play out with a sword to the head as it turned out it may or may not have helped oberyn as he was grabbed by the neck yet depending on the type of helmet it seemed the teeth blow made him almost unconscious and defending that blow perhaps he could wiggle free of survive long enough for the mountain to die is the mountain dead i thought about a vipers snake most scary attributes being its teeth fangs and eyes both of which were destroyed in the battle as far as tyrion for me it could go any direction back in season one i couldnt help thinking somehow ned would not be killed therefore it is very possible he is executed it is fun to think about how he could be saved can an exception be made for mercy and still send him to the wall is the gods decision final could jaime help him escape assuming his execution will not be immediate he mentioned before the trial that helping him escape is treason but we know tywin would have a hard time executing both his sonsis an unknown event about to happen in kings landing that could cause enough chaos to allow him to escape like sansa didvarys or bronn helping him in secret "
"62" "CentralBelter" 2014-06-05 " i wish it would get a move on "
"63" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-05 " oh i think thats a really good theory and one i hadnt considered "
"64" "ID3397218" 2014-06-05 " hasnt she just gone over to the starkside "
"65" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-06-05 " youre probably right "
"66" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-06-05 " i think sansa is still a minor in our terms though not in westeros terms isnt she therefore it would be illegal to show her having sex even if the actor playing her is an adult "
"67" "redmal" 2014-06-05 " she hasnt dyed her hair dark like her mother catelyn and sansa both have the same natural hair colour auburn shes probably changed her hair so as not to be recognized "
"68" "James Minglis" 2014-06-05 " im pretty sure he says the line then i smashed her in the face like this and the chapter ends pretty sure the whole face crushing thing definitely doesnt happen though "
"69" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-06-05 " in the book he just smashes him in the face and then the chapter ends though jonathan has a point from memory admittedly weak and ruined by drink he pulls him towards him so that he impales him on the spear shaft doesnt he "
"70" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-06-05 " every week we get one of these youre going to stop watching a show which you havent enjoyed for ages fair play thats what i would do if i didnt like the show as well from a narrative pov all that mattered was that the mountain killed him it didnt matter how i think yourre wrong about this theres a hugely popular scene in the first lord of the rings film in which the fellowship escape down some stairs across a bridge in moria according to peter jackson all the script said was fellowship run down stairs and across bridge what happened was that the content of the scene expanded during filming until it was one of the keynote action sequences of the whole film which is simply to illustrate that in tv and film it is not just what happens that matters but how "
"71" "crehane" 2014-06-05 " now that shes free of kings landing shes finally putting in to practice all the lessons she has learned from the likes of cersei joffrey margaery the queen of thorns ser meryn trant the hound tryion shae ser dontos littlefinger "
"72" "crehane" 2014-06-05 " i think youre missing the point somewhat jonathan firstly the trial by combat is in the books so its in the show secondly in the books the viper dies by getting his head crushed box ticked for that reason it does serve a narrative function thirdly the way in which it is portrayed in the show does serve an artistic function that of establishing an emotional connection between you the viewerreader and the characters being protrayed your horror shock and disgust is akin to that experienced by tryion jaime ellaria sand his paramour etc and it connects you with these characters on an emotional level the vast majority of dramas on tv these days amount to mind numbingly boring yawn fests got is different i for one am delighted to have a storydrama of such quality that it can elicit that sort of response and emotional attachment in me as a viewer it may not be for everybody but if you dont likeappreciate it then dont watch it there are plenty of mind numbingly boring yawn fest dramas out there for you to watchfall asleep in front of instead all ill say is that compared to them youre not likely to fall asleep in front of an episode of got "
"73" "suedonym66" 2014-06-05 " poor arya always the mourner never the corpse "
"74" "crehane" 2014-06-05 " judging by the title of the episode the watchers on the wall i think thats a pretty safe bet "
"75" "crehane" 2014-06-05 " yes its only a fleshwound lets not overreact folks "
"76" "crehane" 2014-06-05 " it trial by combat to the death combat is a dangerous affair its not beyond the bound of possibility for both combatants to die during the process therefore whomsoever dies first is the loser since the mountain still had enough puff in him to squish oberyn head regardless of his condition alive or dead by the end he had to be alive beyond oberyn in order to inflict upon him the horrible death we all witnessed hence the mountain wins simples "
"77" "CavalierDisregard" 2014-06-05 " i wonder if many people recognised winterfell when they saw it its been so long not surprised the iron islanders gave up so easily it wasnt winterfell it was moat cailin it appeared in the credits for the first time and ramsey mentioned it by name good call on alfred molina for doran martell though "
"78" "tommycoss" 2014-06-05 " the viper is i fear beyond even the help of the lord of light "
"79" "dsk84" 2014-06-05 " thanks for sharing that really good clip get to appreciate that fight even more looking at it from that angle looking at it it almost reminds me of when i used to play soul caliber 2 as kilik against someone like nightmare "
"80" "crehane" 2014-06-05 " i reckon that the missandeigrey worm romance plot line is meant to hammer home for the viewer the devastating damage and cost which the slavery imposed upon these characters has had on them in another time and place missandei and grey worm might have been able to love one another and be lovers but what has been done to them now makes this almost impossible "
"81" "crehane" 2014-06-05 " my moneys on bronn doing the dirty work with jaime paying him to do it ah lets hope its true twould be great to see that pair back together again for another road trip "
"82" "Casimer" 2014-06-05 " so sad to see oberyns demise ive read the books so i knew it was coming but still was hoping against hope the description in the book of oberyn having his teeth smashed in by a mailed fist was perfectly horribly done – then you know hes done for it was really a horrific scene – it keeps on popping into my head what will become of tyrionwhat indeed "
"83" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-05 " i stumbled upon a youtube video where they show some behindthescenes footage from that fight "
"84" "crehane" 2014-06-05 " firstly its probably got a lot to do with the fact that the fantasy genre originated in europe tolkien et al and that the settings are usually variants on the medieval themes of kings and knights etc which also originated in europe as such fantasy done with american accents just sounds completely wrong secondly a good portion of got is filmed in ireland and weve taken swearing to the realms of art form thirdly beneioff and weiss spent some of their formative years studying at trinity college in dublin where im sure they developed an abiding love for the more colourful and inventive forms of irish verbal expressionism or cursing for the unintiateted i for my part and if i do say so meself am quite eloquent and clean mouthed for an irishman  "
"85" "crehane" 2014-06-05 " bronn by his own admission and by declining the option of being tyrions champion didnt really believe that he could have taken the mountain i dont reckon any of the others could either what oberyn brought to the table was his proficiency at dornes unusual and exotic fighting style a style that the mountain being of the hack and slash brigrade probably wasnt too familiar with have to say as a spectacle it looked great and as some have already pointed out i would have enjoyed it even more if the fight had lasted a bit longer "
"86" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-05 " just a bit of a correction on something that i got wrong something that i didnt know the rulers of dorne have been using the titles prince and princess long before they became part of the seven kingdoms this style dates back 700 years before aegon conquered the rest of westeros  1000 years prior the events in game of thrones  and comes from the influence of the rhoynar it is also useful to know that the dornish practice a version of primogeniture in which the firstborn child has the right of inheritance regardless of sex "
"87" "crehane" 2014-06-05 " owing to the nature and particular position of the moon door i prefer to consider that fate as being akin to being flushed out the ars of the eyrie 8 "
"88" "keef1980" 2014-06-05 " no shes realised that she has a bit of power now and is using it "
"89" "crehane" 2014-06-05 " has another look at that scene where sansa appears and descends the stairs im not sure that she has actually dyed her hair and the fact that it appeared darker may have been a trick of the light also did anyone else notice the complimentary nature of her dress to littlefingers cloak a possibly notsosubtle hint towards the fact that they are now both in sync league with one another is sansa to be the future lady baelish "
"90" "Jez Holland" 2014-06-05 " are you saying the way people die has to either be artistic or serve a narrative function are you also saying that people do not die in needless and pointless ways either way you are wrong i would also ask you to rewatch the scene you were so disturbed by and tell me how much gore do you see then you compare it to the saw films i would ask you to go and watch the first saw film again the perception is that it is very gory the reality is very different i think you are perceiving these things to be gorier than they are "
"91" "crehane" 2014-06-05 " definitely not a fantasy eastenders thats actually a massive insult to the source material and grrm if the characters in eastenders had even a fraction of the depth that got characters have then eastenders might actually be a watchable tv show as for whether got has an ending you can rest assured that it does but only grrm dan weiss and david benioff know the full details theyve already put a provisional limit on the length of the show seven seasons however my money would be on a more realistic eight seasons or seven seasons with a big budget movie to finish it off an idea which has been tabled btw at this stage were probably about half way through the story and i reckon by the time were done well be looking back on got as a landmark in tv history a shining example of what can be achieved in the medium of television if it isnt already by the time its completed got will be viewed as one of the greatest tv shows ever made ive a fairly good idea of where this story is going and how it will end keep watching folks coz you aint seen nothing yet "

"108" "dsk84" 2014-06-05 " nicely handled id add that jon snow is more central to the books than he is to the tv show so him being alive in the show should mean more than what it is now just seeing him for 5 minutes an episode if even that i was certainly far more invested in his story in the books at this stage than i am in the show but he is an exception "
"109" "vandenberglegs" 2014-06-05 " the mountain is a known sadist who revels in bringing pointless pain and suffering throw in that he was taunted by a prancing viper to the point where he was nearly vanquished and you get a great big inhumanly strong sadist who is willing to kill someone with his bare hands in the most horrific way and so he did that and its in the book so whatever totally believable if somewhat gory imho "
"110" "dizzzz" 2014-06-04 " well oberyn got a little too cocky  for his own good so thats what you get i too loved the scene with aryn and the hound at the gate to the eyrie sansas transformation was amazing suddenly the light went on im assuming she gave herself up to baelish although could be wrong and that as well as dying her hair dark like her mothers suddenly gives her the upper hand in that relationship lets see if its a flash in the pan or has long reaching consequences as for jorah hes a traitor and you cant trust traitors hes lucky she didnt crucify him as for the nudity count missandei is fetching but a week without the red witch leaves me wanting "
"111" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-06-04 " oberyn was trying to get gregor to admit who gave the order to satiate his own desire for vengeance against tywin as i said above oberyn and his family arent looking to justify their actions the martells just want to punish those responsible for the deaths of elia and her children "

"115" "trizzer" 2014-06-04 " quentyn would be a good storyline i think certain aspects of his story were written fantastically "
"116" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-04 " ah of course though it might have been rather amusing to see the hound on an icelandic pony "
"117" "redmal" 2014-06-04 " i dont think jorahs gone for good its a pity about bronn but theres a possibility he might make a reappearance at a latter date as hes not dead "

"123" "James Minglis" 2014-06-04 " at the point where we are in the tv show from what ive gathered and felt myself no not to the same extent anyway they have changed things that made certain deaths have a bigger impact and the casting has helped too ned is essentially the main character of the first book so that was big he also wasnt sean bean so i think it made it more of a surprise the red wedding was obviously big but the two main characters it killed off werent as important as they are in the show rob for instance does not have any chapters from his perspective the only time we see him are through cats eyes they added a lot of scenes for him in the show khal drogo became much more popular in the show due to the actor and oberyn while awesome isnt around for long enough to gain a strong attachment to him pretty much all his brothel scenes are added to the show i wont say more than that though spoilers and such "
"124" "CaptainCanada" 2014-06-04 " the bloody gate scenes are filmed in iceland no horsies allowed there "
"125" "redmal" 2014-06-04 " i dont think oberyn was so popular in the books anyway there were still a lot of the the popular characters alive in the lalest book so dont worry mind a few dont make it "

"127" "redmal" 2014-06-04 " what are the reasons you are alluding to do you know something i dont "
"128" "NickinFrance" 2014-06-04 " so tell me as a non reader of the books  is the feeling that the best characters seem to get bumped off also true in the books or is it just a bit of fluke of casting but no spoilers please "
"129" "malevoisine" 2014-06-04 " well if the vipers head explosion didnt put me off my dinner that certainly will "
"130" "Jonathan Rossney" 2014-06-04 " last nights episode was the last straw for me ive been bothered by the gratuitously explicit violence in what is essentially a fairly shallow lazily nihilistic emotionally uninvolving show for a while but there was simply no artistic or narrative reason for oberyns death to be as horrifically graphic as it was from a narrative pov all that mattered was that the mountain killed him it didnt matter how from an artistic pov what did we learn from it that the mountain is an unpleasant fellow that westeros is a dark and violent place that worthiness of cause is no guarantee of success that a fight to the death isnt nice well duh  watching got for four seasons has already demonstrated that in spades because there was no artistic or narrative point to oberyns mode of death the only conclusion i can reach is that the creators were going for a cheap grossout shock ending by gruesomely killing a very likeable and flamboyant character in the nastiest way imaginable but such exploitative provocative behaviour worthy of a indie 1970s horror hack fatally undermines the supposed seriousness of the world theyre creating and also demonstrates a breathtaking callousness and sadism that is simply depressing admittedly theyve been doing that for a while with the gratuitious violence and cruelty but never as extremely as this but it is also is an example of remarkable clumsy filmmaking the whole point of the trial by combat is to determine whether tyrion lives or dies and its importance lies in what is at stake both for him and his immediate family we dont give two figs whether the mountain lives or dies and oberyn hasnt been around long enough for us to be invested in his quest for justice but such a disgusting graphic prolonged death scene is so shocking that it actually distracts attention away from whats really important the reaction of tyrion and the other lannisters as i imagine many viewers are going to be so shocked or sickened that they cant pay attention to anything else undercutting such a powerful emotional moment with gratuitous gore is something youd expect from a grindhouse hack not a serious drama so the hell with game of thrones if i ever want pointless nastiness ill rent a saw movie "
"131" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-04 " nevertheless if you think it is unrealistic for oberyn to have beaten the mountain given the choice of weapons then that is your prerogative but you seem to be alone in the opinion "
"132" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-04 " yes i didnt find the whole tableturning very believable he knocks oberyn down and his right hand then moves down by his side then next frame his hand right hand is suddenley behind oberyns neck you can see this by slowing it down but at the time it looked false in normal speed another reason why overall this was not a great duel "
"133" "James Minglis" 2014-06-04 " yeah in the books the duel is much more even and it doesnt happen at the end of an episode in fact it doesnt happen too long after the red wedding if i remember correctly so by that point youre shitting yourself thinking a surely no one else can die now and b if they could die anyone could die its brilliant "
"134" "Idrinkyourmilkshake" 2014-06-04 " hell the only scenes where the characters sound and feel like humans are the ones added by the show a statement which would bizarrely indicate you have neither read the books or watched the show surely that cant be true though i think people are better than that and always have been ive read enough on medieval europe a pet subject of mine to recognise that they were humans then just as now and to also recognise that dogeatdog brutalism materialism and postmodern angst are peculiarly modern conditions the likes of machiavelli and hobbes would argue otherwise im inclined to at least partially agree with them "
"135" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-04 " keep up we are talking about quarterstaffs separately "
"136" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-04 " who was replaced by daario nahaaris for a scene and of course maybe daario is a contender against the mountain "
"137" "NickinFrance" 2014-06-04 " well personally i though the trail by combat all too obvious the surprise ending was well telegraphed to me  oberyn was having it far too easy and it was just so clearly leading up to the big surprise it would be less obvious if the scene had been somewhere in the middle of the episode cant say im that bothered about oberyn although the mistress is another matter in fact since youre single now but i would be sad to see tyrion go its all very well killing off the main characters for shock value but the show is seriously in danger of being left with a bunch of greying bearded dull old men i mean lannister vs baratheon  who gives a fk meanwhile dany is like nick clegg and the libdems  finding the realities of governing far less interesting than the process of getting there as is true for us viewers the best bit me was sansa stark  a character id previously found somewhat irritating if truth be told but watching her literally grow up before us is something only this epic tv can do and her transformation from victim to a woman suddenly aware of the power of her sexuality was brilliant "
"138" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-04 " ah very good thats not a contradiction then i dont remember it happening like that but me not remembering it doesnt mean it didnt happen so ill take your word for it thanks for the response "
"139" "James Minglis" 2014-06-04 " he said he wasnt allowed because yes he was banned by robert as he killed many of roberts and other council members friends during the rebellion he also said he was glad he didnt have to attend them because they were boring but thats all "
"140" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-04 " im confused are you saying that barristan tells jorah that he wasnt allowed in the small council meetings and then later tells him that he didnt attend the meetings because they were boring i remember the scene where barristan tells jorah that he didnt attend the small council meetings because they were boring but are you saying that there was also an earlier scene in which he tells jorah that he didnt attend the small council meetings because he was banned from them by robert "

"143" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-04 " and a man with quarterstaff would do little damage to a man in heavy armour that wasnt a quarterstaff you might have missed it but all of the real damage oberyn did to the mountain was with the giant blade attached to the end of his spear which wasnt strictly speaking merely a spear "
"144" "James Minglis" 2014-06-04 " barristan says it in one of the early scenes with him and jorah "
"145" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-04 " i dont remember it being explicitly stated in the show that ser barristan was banned from the small council and its not in keeping with ser barristans character to lie in that situation "
"146" "elsmallo" 2014-06-04 " i agree and its also not clear how oberyn falls quite so easily and how the mountain manages to get on top of him despite his wound although the mountain as weve seen already is something else i have to give credit to the choreography team who made an impressive the actor they had playing him the 3rd i think is physically the most impressive and with such an unappealing face sorry chap that it was suitably shocking when he finishes the charismatic oberyn but the best mountain was the first who had the fight with loras and the hound at the first tourney in season 1 he actually looked a bit like the hound and was old enough to be his elder brother this guy was too young "

"181" "elleesse" 2014-06-04 " re varys and discussion of desire yes that popped into my head too as regards sansa and littlefinger perhaps she will be his one weakness however his love of cat didnt extend to the people she loved ie ned so im hoping people or things that sansa loves arent treated with the same disregard by him thus hurting her his character has been on the rise since the beginning nothing bad has happened to him no one has found him out the first time hes been called to account was by the lord and lady of the vale was funny to she him being chastised for being a brothel owner etc he genuinely looked worried for a while there when sansa was giving her evidence i think this might be the turning point for his character from rising up to having hit his peak and maybe hell soon be hurtling downwards through his own metaphorical moon door "
"182" "PhilipC2006" 2014-06-04 " i must say that i saw it coming a mile off  which is what made it so excruciating to watch no come on dont get that close what are you argh indira varmas horrified reactions were what made that whole scene though "
"183" "elleesse" 2014-06-04 " good points although one of the reasons im hoping hound and arya dont just swivel on their heels and head off elsewhere is that he could get that wound seen to within the eeyrie when you say tywins plans have backfired i thought he still had manoeuvred jaime into marrying and having casterly rock has that changed without me noticing and i take your point even if the mountain didnt say yes twas tywin the old schemer who made me do it i guess the gruesome death might not go down too well i thought that since the viper went into it voluntarily knowing what he was up against that thered be no repercussions but he was a prince was he not allowed to be killed by well ser is an inaccurate description for the elder clegane would certainly now that i think about it cause anger "

"186" "crehane" 2014-06-04 " i though his extravagant routine and his fighting style was superb all kudos to the stuntfight coordinators whilst the menace and danger of the the mountain is embodied by his sheer size the stunt coordinators made the red viper look equally as lethal if not more so just by the way moved ultimate respect to pablo pascal also as all season long his arrogant and self confident swagger has been hinting at this lethality bubbling just beneath the surface "
"187" "dsk84" 2014-06-04 " i remember jaime was listing the people who hed struggle to face in combat and off the top of my head he mentioned the cleganes and great jon umber the guy whos fingers greywind bit off in season 1 i wonder how grey worm would do he too wields a spear and would have a decent mobility advantage "
"188" "madpete" 2014-06-04 " excellent episode with a most unexpected and unfortunate ending thats what i have always loved about got it never fails to surprise and to twist and turn like a slippery unpredictable snaking plot which is impossible to predict "
"189" "crehane" 2014-06-04 " have to agree with you there in got terms this season has been a massive one the fall out of the red wedding followed fairly rapidly by the purple wedding revelations about the plot and who was behind it the crowning of a new king sansas escape revelations about littlefingers ambitions and plotting going back to the very beginning lysa arans marriage and death tryions peril that duel to the gruesome death still two more episodes to go and ive a feeling that there are going to be some massive plot developments over the course of each watch this space "
"190" "randombloke" 2014-06-04 " the truth is that i think the reason i was so disturbed by the red vipers untimely death was that it happened in front of his shocked lover how unimaginably traumatic "
"191" "crehane" 2014-06-04 " yes my money is on either jaime or bronn having a change of heart and coming ot tryions rescue "
"192" "dsk84" 2014-06-04 " the line about poison is bs but it wasnt just the hound i believe there was a discussion between ned and pycelle about poison where it was described as a weapon used by women cowards and eunuchs "
"193" "crehane" 2014-06-04 " actually though something similar myself namely that once oberyn had extracted his confession from the mountain he would spin around and launch his spear at tywin nailing him to his chair boy was i wrong "
"194" "Dewulf" 2014-06-04 " yeah ive recently noticed that in myself even  looking for signs much more than i used to i guess with other shows i didnt need to look too much because you pretty much knew what was going to happen now with got we have a perfect storm of plot interest pique  a we really really love the show and the characters b there are a lot of characters and related intersecting arcs and c anything can happen anyone can dieso its actually fun and worth getting into the fullon speculation for once that said i guess people are now paying attention to foreshadowing now as a way to hopefully protect themselves against the shock of losing a loved character without warning "
"195" "crehane" 2014-06-04 " there are parallels between sansa and aryas progressiontransformation towards being something else in both cases each character has only really started to learn from their experiences since pairing up with their latest partners ie littlefinger and the hound respectively when you consider it in that context and in the context of what has happened to each of these characters each of them has been learning from their experiences and is being shaped and moulded by them as such arya is now accelerating towards become a teenage psychopath along the lines of kick asss hit girl and sansa is morphing into a player of the got to rival cersei and margaery quite realistic and believeable when you look at what each of them has been through "
"196" "toxicape" 2014-06-04 " haha the bit you said about the introduction of oberyn as a character was original dont let yourself be humbled and hodored so easily i had exactly the same silly impulse how the show keeps making a fool of me in the same way that oberyn was too interesting a character with more to come to die so soon i kind of hope i never learn these shocks are so good "
"197" "dsk84" 2014-06-04 " im hoping the leaked casting didnt mention them because theyve already got someone in mind at least for arianne anyway i dont care quite as much for quentyn "
"198" "crehane" 2014-06-04 " since he sat on the fence almost until the end of roberts rebellion tywin would also have wanted to ensure that none of the targaeryans wouldcould talk who knows what he had promised them up to the point that he betrayed them remember that as the story goes the lannisters arrived at kings landing on the premise that they were there to reinforce the capital however once the gates were opened to them they began to sack the city in roberts name and made a beeline for the red keep when that happened aerys targaeryan the mad king gave the order to burn them burn them all and jamie responded by skewering him through the back therefore the murder of elia and her children was all part of the act of wiping out the targaeryans and leaving the way clear for robert or ned stark or tywin lannister to ascend the irone throne the murders were an act of fealty towards robert and were done with tywin knowledge and blessing he just wasnt brave enough or powerful enough to claim the throne fro himself thats why he had to settle for marrying his daughter to robert and bide his time "

"221" "jibbajibba" 2014-06-04 " so i agree totally that whatever fiction you choose to enjoy has no impact on your bravery cowardice or whatever and is really only useful an indication of what sort of fiction you enjoy i would note that your own comments do seem to indicate that you feel a degree of superioirtiy whether moral or esthetic to those that enjoy got but i will not dwell on it as to your specific points i agree totally that people in the middle ages were much like people now they had opinions they laughed they cried etc  however your position that knights were better people than depicted by martin seems to be out of synch with this very argument we see time and time again that when people are given absolute control and freedom from consequence of violent action they behave in the most base and savage manner if this can occur in nazi germany modern sudan or the belgian congo then surely it can also occur in the riverlands the streets of kings landing or desolate moors of the north after all people are people and are prone to the same tempations and weakness of character we know from medieval examples like the excesses of the crusades in the holy land as well as the tutonic genocide of the slavs in north that knights were all to human in this regard and if anything martin pulls punches when you look at brutality and violenceno one has suggested that the entire population of the north be moved into labour camps before they are all murdered and their land repopulated with southern peasants of the right racial stock and religious beliefs well not yet anyway as for their being no redeeming elements to martins world you have already admitted you havent read them so your comment should be that there are no redeeming elements in the tv series to which those that have been watching would point to jon snow danys emancipation of the slaves tyrions humanity varyss loyalty to the concept of a righteous ruler ned starks honor etc got is possibly unique in as much as even the majority of villains demonstrate their good sides cersie loves her kids jaimies respect for brienne tywins ambition not for personal glory but for family glory etc etc the monsters like locke ramsey the mountain and lord frey act really as cyphers by which we can compare the other villains and observe their relative humanity in comparison finally you say there is no humour no warmth surely you have missed tyrions one liners oberyns put downs and davoss entire existence then there is sam tarley a better man youll be unlikely to find and the core brotherhood of the watch just sayin "

"286" "davidjones2492" 2014-06-03 " but westeros has a concept of chivalry and a feudal structure that exactly resembles that of medieval europe westeros also has a dominant religion based on christianity worship of the seven the author explores the nature of this in the book and the show medieval knights were supposed to aspire to a code of chivalry and justice but at the same time were armed killers who were valued mainly for their effectiveness in war in reality knights including religious orders like the knights templar and the teutonic knights were responsible for horrific acts often when involved with religious conflicts in reality people have consistently ignored chivalry and religion when it has suited them the fact that gregor clegane can be a knight while at the same time be a rapist a mass murderer and a killer of children explores this contradiction the show does not portray every knight in the same way the hound is so appalled by his brother he refuses to ever become a knight himself individuals like beric dondarrion barristan selmy all the starks brienne take morality and their vows extremely seriously it is not only sympathetic characters that die nastily the bad guys get hit as well i agree with you that oberyn martells death was extremely shocking gory and disgusting this is what it was intended to be i would argue that the level of gore in the show is high but that this is to be expected in one that portrays a war i feel that the gore is generally done in ways that add to the drama and are not gratuitous there have been many deaths that have been shocking but are done in such a way so as to elicit emotional responses from characters and viewers in season 1 viserys was boiled to death in molten gold the manner of his death was horrible but served to give us some sympathy for him despite him being petty murderous and insane the red wedding was noted to be particularly brutal even within the narrative of the story the fact that it was an affront to all the laws of hospitality was and remains integral to the plot from the perspective of the viewer it is intended to be horrific and to make us hate the lannisters when joffrey dies everyone is happy but the manner of his death in the arms of his mother makes the viewer realise that they have been looking forward to and actively willing the death of a horrible character but one who is effectively a child oberyns death is meant to be a hammer blow a just popular character being beaten to death by a thug in the most jarring way possible i agree it is extremely difficult to watch but surely any death in a fight between two men with armour on is likely to be i understand why you feel that the brutality of this death is too much however i would argue it is necessary try watching the start of saving private ryan without the gore it wont be half as shocking or effective "

"385" "ModestHill" 2014-06-03 " but the actors arent writing the scripts they may be recommending changes to the script but it seems much more likely that its written by someone with an ear for earthy and colloquial british usage or to be pedantic the earthy and colloquial britishstyle usage of the fictional people of westeros "

"476" "Dukered" 2014-06-03 " personally i think it would be out of character for tywin to gratuitously offend the martells by slaughtering elyia and children surely a better way would have been a trial of some kind so the guilt for the inevitable purging of the targaeryan dynasty would have been shared however i cant say with certainty that tywin didnt act quickly to eliminate any potential claimants who would compromise cerseis childrens claim to the throne  again i think you are getting confused here when elia was killed the lannisters had no claim to the throne cersei was not yet roberts queen  ffs robert wasnt even king yet they were not even betrothed and had no childrenalso tywin had no authority in westeros outside of casterley rock nor would he have had any say about any trial if there was any reason why twyin did wht he did then it would have been to prove to robertned that he was not on the side of the mad king "

"482" "ab47690" 2014-06-03 " exactly what i was thinking "
"483" "Dukered" 2014-06-03 " i thought that was a bit unrealistic actually why would tywin go to all that effort just to turn dany against jorah hes just one knight in an army of thousands jorah and selmy are the only knights that dany had in her army being from westeros having allies in westeros and being able to counsel dany about her enemies etc etc is why tywin did what he did "

"486" "Dukered" 2014-06-03 " i think you are all forgetting that the lannisters were not in power at the time tywin would have had no authority whatsoever to marry elia to anyone robert baratheon was the claimant to the throne and the lannisters allegiance was ambiguous at best right up until the sacking of kings landing in fact it was suggestd in the book that the brutal murder of the targaryan children was intended to demonstrate tywins allegiance to robert instead of the mad king however since the war was all but won already by robert and ned stark tywin may have felt he needed to make a statement to prove his allegiance since he had basically done a walder frey and waited to see who was likely to win the war before choosing sides thus tywin murdered elia and her kids to prove to robert that he was on his side i think finally tywin may not have known what the mountain was like at that time but he sure as hell does now yet he still uses him to carry out his dirty workie gregor is still tywin lannisters mad dog which suggests that tywin does not disapprove at all of his methods i think it is also incorrect to say that any conqueror would have killed the targaryan kids in british history this kind of thinkg did happen from time to time but it was considered abhorrent and totally unchristian behaviour to slaughter children for any reason whatsoever one of the plantagenet kings did this and earned himself a lot of enemies in the process "

"515" "imorris" 2014-06-03 " without revealing any spoilers i think its going to be very difficult for the tv show not to overtake the books martin is writing in the next series there is plenty of material to work with for some of the characters but unlike martin  who is happy to ignore major characters for several hundred pages at a time  the shows creators have obviously been reluctant or perhaps unable to focus attention on one or two stories and forget about others  hence theon spending the entirety of season three being tortured he doesnt even feature in martins third novel  we simply learn that hes been held in captivity and abused when he reenters the story in the fourth as a result some of the characters in the tv show have almost got to where martin left them in the books i realise this might not be the forum for discussing this given the risk of someone revealing a spoiler but id be interested to know how other fans of the books think the shows creators are going to tackle this it seems increasingly unlikely that martin will finish writing the next instalment before 2015 by which stage the show will presumably be working on season six this current series differs from the books more than any of the preceding ones and i wonder if the show just goes off in its own direction entirely from season five onwards personally i think that would be a real shame for the books fans  kind of a spoiler the other way round novels based on a film are never especially good and i cant see how martin could ignore what happens in the tv show when he eventually gets around to completing the saga if he ever does "

"656" "Clariana" 2014-06-03 " i think oberyn was being a bit optimistic however it does not look as though the mountain is used to be opposed and defeated and he often reacts badly to it remember when loras in the first series defeats him in the tourney and the hound intervenes so under that kind of pressure he might well have given something away also other things might have been brought to bear "

"660" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-06-03 " agreed and i think thats the point that oberyn was trying to make during his failed interrogation he considered the mountain as a weapon deployed by tywin whom he held ultimately accountable for his sister and her children i was genuinely terrified they would get the oberyn character badly wrong in the series and he would end up like darrio with a tan but in the end pascal got the balance brilliantly hes one of the few got characters that really comes alive on the page perhaps because hes the swashbuckling acrtype the bisexual thing is certainly there in the book however they cut out a lot of his back story such as how he earned the name the red viper of dorne and his succesion of ferocious bastard daughters so it comes across more as a shorthand for how unconventionalhedonistic he is it seems far more in keeping with his outlook as a man of the world when you know a little more about him and his life dorne is seen as a place apart from the seven kingdoms and he encapsulates that non conformity he is only the younger brother but hes more symbolic of dorne than his even tempered peaceful older brother who will probably not appear til next season "

"666" "Moreisless" 2014-06-03 " i really enjoyed last nights episode standout moments for me was the look sansa gave littlefinger which said i own you now arya telling the hound that he was walking slowly stones and pillars the headpopping scene actually made me laugh it was like evil deadthe only problem logically for me was the outing of jorah it made no sense from a strategic point of view why would you expose the only person who could give you information about the targaeryan girl and her dragons even if he had stopped sending reports back to kings landing exposing him means daenerys now knows she is on tywins radar "

"668" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-06-03 " they do seem to be talking about his wound an awful lot which implies its going to be a factor there are often parallels in different stories and i dont think its a coincidence that the hound is wounded and weakened right around the same time his brother has the contents of his stomach put on public display there was also the fact that the hound referred to his would as a flea bite as tyrion alluded to the mountain smashing oberyn like a beetle are both brothers to be killed by insect bites have to say the choreography of the fight scene was superb particularly oberyns acrobatic defense best fight scene of the whole series so far "

"812" "steve3742" 2014-06-03 " but lets remember that for game of thrones the truly holy shit moments usually occur in the penultimate episodes youre right but bearing in mind that next weeks episode is called the watchers on the wall it doesnt take a genius to see that the focus is going to be on the wall and the army of wildlings that have been marching on it for over a year now real time not tv time i think theyve dragged that out a bit too long but theyll be wrapping it up next week only a guess but im thinking they may make the whole episode about that a la blackwater so the last episode which is usually a little low key will deal with the aftermath of the walltyrions appointment with the axearya and the houndand only a guess but i think brienne will meet a character we havent seen for a while  bought forward a bit from the books but itd make a good impression at the end of the series possibly the very end of the episode either way its not going to be that low key an episode "

"816" "ID706850" 2014-06-03 " there were clear warnings both before the programme and after the midshow ad break that the following contains scenes of extreme violence pretty unequivocal to my mind "
"817" "Dukered" 2014-06-03 " it feels like we have been building to that episode for some time but i think the next two will be even more climactic another episode of if only moments that torment arya gets to within a hop and a skip of meeting up with sansa the viper so nearly gets his vengeance tyrion so nearlyetc my favourite part was the look on littlefingers face when he first realised that sansa was about to bail him out before a second thought occurred to himthat sansa might be mire dangerous than he had realised the stupid young girl who was a terrible liar was now a cunning woman who can lie very convincingly in that one look baelish went from fear to relief to cockiness to mild concern that sansa was a player and not his pawn brilliant even if his accent still sucks i also enjoyed the scene where the boltons arrived at winterfell it always melts the heart when i hear that tragic winterfell theme tune they played it when they were about to melt ice in episode 1 as well "
"818" "hazh" 2014-06-03 " littlefinger seemed almost vulnerable at the beginning of sansas confession scene i thought the show made a mistake in making someone who is so careful in his plots and schemes like littlefinger to allow himself to get into such a vulnerable position doesnt quite compute i think "
"819" "HAL88" 2014-06-03 " ultimately i think it was a bridge too far i am so getting bored with kings landing i hate all the characters past tyrion there oberyn was quickly getting me interested again in the capital i was looking forward to seeing him like try and destabilize things in the capital and try to take on all the vipers around him eventually expected him to die instead they just did a really far too gruesome death you didnt have to see every detail it also just came off as rinse and repeat of ned stark which is so boring i really getting disappointed with this season been some great character stuff but stuff like how little finger started the war jofferys death both had underwhelming impact wanted way more reaction panoramic reaction to jofferys death without it all the focus on the aristocrats it just lacked big impact even littlefingers reveal should of been huge but it was tiny and so freaking rubbishly handled i do hope we are completely done with kings landing  i want to see the peasantry reacting the world collapsing and all the other characters kings landing has become stagnant varis is useless he just doesnt have anyone to bounce off so gets meh i see how this season ends but if it doesnt shake things up and stays the same i may not pick up season 5 or watch it and unless big stuff starts moving my interest will diminish "

"825" "baldynapper" 2014-06-03 " some interesting development for sansa in the the last few episodes and as mentioned by sarah looks like the stark girls are quick learners better learners than their brothers certainly but does anyone think she genuinely has some hold over littlefinger due to her resemblance to catelyn i tend to think its just another move on his part letting her think that he has misplaced his youthful passion for her mother onto her despite his oft repeated claim that he has only ever loved one woman i think littlefinger has only ever loved himself he just strikes me as someone who has developed something of an obsession for acquiring things hes been told that he cannot or should not possess certainly the events hes brought about dont seem to indicate any love for catelyn more like hes brought ruin to the starks and jon arryn for taking his toy away "
"826" "DiamondDag" 2014-06-03 " it was a nasty image so i dont blame you for being disturbed by it but this series has been full of some pretty nasty violence over the years the problem i find is much of it lacks the horror element that the books have sarah is absolutely right grrms background in horror is actually one of the things i appreciate most about his writing hes great at building atmosphere and tension in a scene so that when he is graphic its genuinely horrific the show does capture that feeling beyond the wall though i think there was actually a scene in tonights episode taken from a dance with dragons when theon goes to treat with the ironborn that i found hard to read in the books it involved poison blood and no small amount of puss maybe a good thing they didnt have time for it "
"827" "elleesse" 2014-06-03 " fantastic blog as usual from sarah she always pinpoints a couple of things that i missed figuring out and makes me go oh yes of course thats why x person didsaid that my worry that the hound was for it last week due to being bitten on the neck has happily not occurred  dying to see now if he and arya gain entry or just walk away now no doubt its more likely that theyll just walk away after aryas hysterical laughter of either despair or at the hounds plans to ransom her once again scuppered hope whether they get in or not is shown in the next episode and not left until next season go sansa whered she get the dress from dead aunt lysa and thanks to all the commentators above who answered the question i was thinking why is she suddenly singing ive got the power duh duh de duh duh duh de duh answer because she finally has something that someone else wants doh however how far can one push baelish hes such a slippery fish i cant imagine him allowing his lustlove for her to sway him from any schemes beneficial to him or maybe she truly is his one and only achilles heel look forward to seeing what transpires there loved how they filmed her coming down the stairs with the light flickering around her it did conjure up very well how it feels when that bing thats the one im a gonner moment happens enjoyed how jaime was appreciating the vipers fighting well until it was indeed rather impressive i suppose the admission of guilt from the mountain wont impact tywin in any way as in he is ser clegane known to be in tywins employ therefore tywin will ultimately be liable or will he been seen to be a loose canon acting of his own free will the violence and eyepopping braincrushing didnt bother me so much as i cowered and covered my eyes for that whole part thus missing future nightmares and trauma speaking of tywin the letter confused me until i read this blog and comments of course it was a fake but with the real hand of the king seal on it was wondering had they been keeping the pardon from since before ned starks time but no it does show tywins knowledge of what makes people tick a very simple way to set the cat amongst the pigeons seeing that cerceis humiliation of ser barriston drove him to the enemys side except that how will he wrench barriston from her no skeletons in his closet no weak point that i can see i hope jorah rides off into the sunset and meets a woman who makes him forget dany and who desires him back and he regains some feeling of being needed and desired i have been ser or rather miss friendzone on a couple of occasions and it aint fun i never however was simultaneously spying on the object of my affection however i think a loved up outcome for jorah is unlikely back to westeros to be pumped for information or willingly giving it in a fit of pique rather like shae well sceeereeew that bitch im going take her down and tell tywin all her weaknesses type of thing sam was very sweet in his worrying over gilly and baby sam hope hope they are reunited and he never lets her out of his sight again did anyone notice the blood dripping from between the floorboards above in that scene in molestown the pillar and stones of grey worm did start a discussion here of what function mr worm might have down there there are obviously some stirrings i think she whose name begins with m that i cant recall initially noted him looking at her in the river and stood up thinking that it was meaningless then covered herself feeling somehow that he wasnt the sexless man that she previously thought nice to see dany plaiting her hair a moment of humbleness and respite from danys usual i am the mother of dragons and you are herefore and forever after banished ser friendzone type communication all in all an episode about endings jorahs relationship with dany over the end of the hounds mission to return arya and get money over and what now the real end of any stark rule in the north uh oh the end of tyrions hope for a reprieve now get out of that then end of poor obeyron splat nothing to do with the last episode at all but the episode 2 previous to this i think when bran et al were outside crastors keep and he went warging into his wolfs body and they found the second wolf and he woke up with a start and said that the wolf had been caught in a trap was the animal ever released that was never made clear anyone know are we to assume it is dead "
"828" "SlipperyJim" 2014-06-03 " i think youll find tyrions beetle story was referring to the gods rather than people like the mountain he was trying to understand why they cause or allow so much suffering and the purpose of it all "

"876" "sidfromse" 2014-06-02 " my problem at the moment with the whole lannister storyline is that tywin is basically messing it up why let cersei play out what is an obvious revenge fantasy on tyrion when he is potentially his only legal heir hes putting all his eggs in the jaime basket but i can see jaime turning round and saying screw you not marrying anyone and swoosh off goes the lannister inheritance for what its worth now their gold mines arent producing anything to some cadet branch descended from his brother so all his legacy is is an inbred doublegrandson rather insecurely on the throne it doesnt make sense when weve seen how astute he is but perhaps he has something else up his sleeve "

"882" "Werthead" 2014-06-02 " its the medieval period but without christianity romance and chivalry the chief ideas that occupied the minds of the people of the time the notion of chivalry has always been overblown more the creation of writers and historians of the time than what we can see from historical records the butchering of jerusalem by the first crusaders including jewish residents and their own christian allies as well as the muslims both french and english soldiers being mown down by arrow fire from a tremendous distance at agincourt and towton rather than risking a more honourable closeup fight richard ii being cruelly starved to death the fate of thomas more the scottish king brutally murdering his rivals under a flag of truce at the black supper the inspiration for the red wedding more than five hundred years of pretty much total slaughter and where mercy was often rewarded with betrayal various kings pardoning margaret beaufort for her intrigues only for her to arrange for her husband to betray richard iii and have her son ascend the throne and thats a fairly mild example got is pretty brutal but not a lot moreso than our real history one area where the tv series does fail however is by not showing more of the past like the books do the decades and decades of peace under most of the targaryens the mostly peaceful reign of robert baratheon and so on this failure to show that there is something worth fighting for in this world is probably the tv shows biggest weakness "

"911" "Luke18" 2014-06-02 " i dont think this episode was as good as the trial or the purple wedding although one of the most effective at bringing together all the story lines i feel the fight couldve done with being a little longer and maybe a set up before of the red vipers thoughts about his sister rather than forcing it to becoming about that during the fight "

"970" "Luke18" 2014-06-02 " i am growing in concern for the direction being taken  i love how the show doesnt play with conventions just like everyone else does the red wedding was a masterstroke however its beginning to feel that we are running out of people worth rooting for and with that the show will start to lose its soulhowever maybe im wrong maybe this season will end with a good guy flourish with jon and tyrion escaping the certain death that seems to stare them straight in the face and sansa if reunited with her sister may stop becoming a walking baelish puppet but at the moment the show follows a bit too many threads to keep characters beloved in the time frame it sets itself and seems to only give them time when it comes to bumping them offi think the size of the story and the shows popularity demands a 13 or 15 episode run next year to allow more time in each characters world and therefore bits like the wildlings attacking moles town wont feel like a hark back to a forgotten plot "

"977" "HollywoodPass" 2014-06-02 " really im sorry but i saw that coming 30 seconds into the fight it was obvious that oberyn would win but equally obvious that his arrogance and wild temper would allow the mountain to take him out at the last second and obvious that the dramatically most powerful though realistically least credible result would result in mountain dying last and tyrion getting the death sentence "
"978" "HollywoodPass" 2014-06-02 " i think the writers were having a laugh seeing if wed get the obvious reference every time oberyn called out in his spanish accent you killed her you raped her you murdered her children i heard the following words my name is ignatius loyola you killed my father prepare to die jeez they were almost wearing the same costume and hairstyle "
"979" "DiamondDag" 2014-06-02 " im a big fan of the viper but even i wouldnt call that a draw see now im just imagining oberyns pulpy mess of a head doing his best monty python impression all right well call it a draw "
"980" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-02 " how is it ruining the story or not contributing to the plot if tyrion somehow lives his situation will be quite different than if he was actually exonerated and there are all kinds of implications for the relationship of the lannisters with dorne if you think of all the things we know about dorne about why oberyn came about his brothers nature about the historical connections that dorne has it all fits together in sending the story in one direction rather than another even the mountains death could have some interesting implications for other people "
"981" "Chris Howell" 2014-06-02 " god i feel so stupid this show  again  fooled me i fully expected oberyn to win but to lose and to lose like that jesus what a horrible horrible death oberyns head going pop shocked me more that the red wedding i was expecting a happy ending i wasnt paying attention after 4 seasons i should know better "
"982" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-02 " yes lots of us shocked about oberyn also my favourite new character to come in since the whole things started pedro pascal was so good in the role it just felt unbelievable that we would lose the character   i desperately need a fix of that charismatic swaggering fulloflife south american style energy that pedro gave us but having a bit of a peak on the soiaf website am not a book reader i dont think we are going to get it a big bright sunny ballsy hole is left in the show and it seems a a terrible shame i recently just watched seasons 3 and 4 of walking dead so gory deaths seem a bit normal but it was awful yes some good points made about negative relationships in the series  we need some positive happy relationships to balance it out  some light to define the dark  some humour to leaven the horror no bron and tyrion nowbrienne is too gruff with pod so that not buddybuddy enough i think i can understand ygritte sparing gilly as she may have recognised she was a wilding too i think all my previous liking and sympathy for dany has evaporated  i really loved ser jorah and his crustiness ser barristan can go to hell and dany is soooo stupid the only redeeming relationship is worm and missendei  i think maybe that is why it has been added to the show the program has reached quite a dark period "

"984" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-02 " there is actually quite a lot of religious content in the story stannis is driven by a religion very similar to zoroastrianism the iron islanders are driven by religion and it is behind a lot of what theon does when he abandons the stark cause brans quest is essentially spiritual or religious and the northerners in general really reflect their religious beliefs in their actions magic seems tied up with religious questions generally weve seen a fair bit in the background about the worship of the seven though the current lannister regime isnt religious we know some kings been and it plays a more important part as the story goes on "

"986" "Glenn Parrington" 2014-06-02 " even knowing full well what the outcome of the trial by combat would be oberyns ignoble death was devastating he was such a good character and so well cast that i was genuinely hoping they would deviate from the book by having him live for a few more episodes but i know this could never have worked this was one of the best episodes of season 4 the sansa revelation to the lords of the vale was a skilful edit of the source material which i dont mind sansas show character like her book counterpart benefits from being seen to escape the shadow of kings landing and start becoming a player my only complaint was tyrions extended story about the beetles  hes a great character but his patchy accent devalues any long speeches he makes and in this case his words didnt develop the story in any meaningful way either the weak and innocent get crushed we get it move on  that was 5 minutes wasted the hound and arya at the gates of the eyrie smacked of an excuse to reuse the set as well but never mind after a week of grieving for oberyn im not really looking forward to the impending battle at the wall "
"987" "Annuska" 2014-06-02 " a lot of violence is sanitised to the point it doesnt shock that doesnt happen in got it so doesnt happen that even when we have longed for somebodys death it still manages to shock like joffreys did death by violence is horrible and shocking its not pretty explosions and bruce willis oneliners "
"988" "DiamondDag" 2014-06-02 " yeah yeah oberyn dead blah blah what have they done to sansa my god that was awful "
"989" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-02 " um i dont think got is unambiguous or totally dark it is actually pretty moralistic maybe the show just hasnt got far enough into the story yet or maybe the show doesnt capture enough but there are a number of clear redemption stories people who meet their end almost always do so through their own failings and there is a lot about the bonds of family community and even nature and how they strengthen or cause weakness when they are broken there is not only a struggle between good and evil within the individual characters we see it being played out at the mythological and metaphysical level in the story as well what i would say with got is that the stakes are real in the story and not romanticized  we see the effects on the poor and helpless we see that people have become they way they are often because they are damaged we see that even if you find redemption there may be death that sometimes the evil will prosper we see just how brutal that death can be but i dont think you can really have a good morality tale without the stakes being high "
"990" "TitusK" 2014-06-02 " dunno if this has been mentioned yet vut as soon as oberyn entered the arena performing his extravagant spear twirling routine my mind went straight to raiders of the lost ark how could he do something like that and then win specially after the hound telling arya that dancing swordsmen only win till they meet someone with a big fing sword "

"995" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-02 " i thought it was just because it was relatively simple everything was in place he could cause trouble with almost no effort he also doesnt know just what will happen she could dismiss jorah kill him maybe he hopes he can get jorah back to westeros to pick his brain so he may have been setting things in motion that could have a number of positive outcomes for him "

"998" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-02 " i dont think that you can always directly compare books to a screen with stuff like this it was true id say to the book depiction but images affect people differently than written descriptions and that is something that has to be accounted for as far as gore for gores sake that can happen people use it to manipulate viewers or cause controversy or even for sexual satisfaction rather than to really make the story better got has always tried to be fairly realistic which makes sense given the themes of the story itself but it doesnt mean it isnt possible to cross the line given that it is commercial tv with pressures to always ramp up the interest it will always be a danger they do it with the sex often enough god knows sacrificing the story for some boob scenes "

"1145" "emmack" 2014-06-02 " havent seen it yet but was aware this would be coming the red viper as a character i was largely not fussed with in the books that being said i thought pascal really did a fantastic job with him as you say sarah  just the right amount of swagger and style it is a shame he has been so shortlived i do hope the people who came out in force about him absolutely being the wrong man for the job based on the colour of his skin feel a bit silly now "
"1146" "OutrageKat" 2014-06-02 " i knew it when i read it in the books but now ive seen it on tv the chant that oberyn does is like the xrated version of indigo montoyas my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die just with a grrm ending "
"1147" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-02 " oberyns death is a sad loss to the show that already lost one of the few fun characters granny olenna earlier in the season i hope it wont turn too bleak well the queen of thorns hasnt been in any recent episodes but she isnt dead so im not sure that she has been lost in the same way as weve lost oberyn "
"1148" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-02 " i dont know  i think as a series it is basically optimistic and shows a lot of faith in the redemptive possibilities in humanity and plenty of sympathetic characters havent died "
"1149" "alastair415" 2014-06-02 " am i the only one that thought oberyns death was cartoonishly grotesque for its own sake as violent as the show can be this season has had some pointless walking dead style gore his shocking death only made his one dimensional character seem that much more like a cheap plot mechanism the bisexuality seeming like a tacked on detail to pad him out a bit "
"1150" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-02 " on that note i actually loved jaimes reactions during the fight of course he was worried about his brother but as someone born to fight who was once one of the best warriors in westeros i saw surprise and admiration in jaime as he watched oberyn it was like watching a master musician take joy in watching the unexpected performance by another "
"1151" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-02 " as usual the tyrionjamei scenes and houndarya scenes were great i am just sick about the hounds wound though  hes my favorite the fight was well done  the contrast between the two fighting styles was wonderful and you could see the advantage of the log spear against gregor i dont tend to be squeamish but i had to close my eyes at the end and the sound still really bothered me tywin didnt seem particularly happy when he thought the mountain had lost nor when he won the sansalittlefinger stuff was really interesting plotwise there are all sorts of political possibilities i wasnt convinced by sansas transformation at the end though  she looked like she was playing grownup when she walked down towards the camera its interesting that we dont have much sense anymore where her moral values lay which is quite a contrast from the books it shows how things can seem much more ambiguous to an outside observer but i also wonder if they are going to go in the same direction despite being sympathetic to the wildlings position it is hard to like them much i found the jon snow scene underwhelming  it laid out their difficulty quite clearly but i wanted more to happen i find myself wondering where they will be in the story by episode 10 gilly is pretty resourceful though i think she is a character with a lot of potential to be interesting i found the danyjorah stuff to be less interesting and moving than i expected i am not convinced that the actress really has the chops to pull off that role and that was really my problem i think barristan i think was aware that he was playing into tywins hands but really what else could he do i am underwhelmed by the grey worm romance i know it should be touching but somehow i just dont care the stuff with reek roose and ramsey was really really good i cant help but think that ramsey will still have a hard time living up to rooses standards roose is as far as i can see actually a very able and efficient leader and administrator and i think ramsey is to much of a loose cannon for that it will be interesting to see what reeks struggle at maintaining his fake identity might mean "
"1152" "Peyto" 2014-06-02 " i agree and with the ramsey boltontheon storyline and also the stabbing of talisa at the end of season 3 its becoming kind of gratuitous will watch to the end of the season and see if there are more than a couple of characters left to care about before spending any more time on it "

"1161" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-06-02 " i know i was just having a laugh its what gets me through these dark times martin is pretty clear about deconstructing the fantasymedieval mythology its what makes it such an interesting series he constantly plays your own cynical expectation against you just when you think well i know how this will turn out he pulls the rug from underneath you its only because these myths are so strong in our culture that we keep falling for the same feint over and over we keep thinking that eventually the good guy will win "
"1162" "DMcCool" 2014-06-02 " i feel exactly the same sometimes you get some stunning performances in this show and it has the best budgeted and performed actionintrigue you will find anywhere on telly but it is precisely the philosophical stance which this episode proves is very conscious that i find completely disagreeable its george orwells vision of a totalitarian future a jack boot stamping on a human face forever humanity only seems a contingent feature in got so long as it can be made to suffer at some point the problem is that as horrible as the world is now the past was and the future will be its a grisly reduction of humanity to only what is most appealing to psychopaths "

"1164" "DMcCool" 2014-06-02 " again all victims being victimised or lusty maidens and knights being lusty thats the other paradigm that grrm understands i havent read all the books but in the show there is an amazing lack of any characters who seem to even like each other at all almost every single character is trying to get one over everyone else when there are friendships they are begrudging and you always forced by circumstance you get the feeling the one would always sell out the other the hedge knights were a pleasant exception and i understand we still have more to see of them at least bleakness cruelty sex psychopaths being psychopaths and tyrion the show has just grated on me by this time its the medieval period but without christianity romance and chivalry the chief ideas that occupied the minds of the people of the time its sterile and bloody im not saying that in principle having the bad guys win is bad or showing horrible things happening to good people isnt a perfectly good way to write a series but got takes it to another level and there is the running assumption that everyone is essentially either a complete arsehole or a victim of one the interpretation given to the beetlesmashing sums the shows worldview up perfectly there is no explanation people will murder because they can its whether or not you want to watch dozens of hours of a show with that as the central premise is the question personally im out "

"1166" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-06-02 " yes from anybody else it would seem a touching gesture but roose is neither sentimental  i chose his fattest daughter or foolish we also know he finds ramsay distasteful he probably figures its better to have ramsay on his side than turning against him and hes in a very interesting position he holds the dreadfort and winterfell but cant realistically rule both so he gives one to ramsay something tells me that whichever bolton sets himself up as lord of winterfell wont last long in the north given the loyalty to the starks so roose is probably setting him up and keeping him onside all at the same time "

"1179" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-06-02 " surely this will open up more stuff from dorne soon one would have to hope so oberyn as the 2nd son and out of the line of succession was not the expected emissary that the lannisters wanted for joffreys wedding so its clear he was always on a suicide mission of sorts even in his death he may have achieved what he set out to do not just in mortally wounding the mountain its hard to survive being run through multiple times no matter how tall you are the whole court heard clegane admit his actions and so the pretext for war that dorne has been looking for has been delivered now the question is what will be their next move its a constant theme in the show how power is a fleeting thing where you can appear sure footed one moment the ground can give way beneath you the next it was interesting to see the episode end with bolton and baelish setting themselves as independent agents in their own fiefdoms while the repercussions of another open war with dorne loom on the horizon after the mountain spilled his guts so to speak power has its own dynamic and it appears that the momentum has shifted against tywin out of money and fast running out of allies his enemies are now more numerous and more powerful than ever "
"1180" "jackiscool" 2014-06-02 " yes i dont think he was making a man up oberyn comment i think he was commenting on how the shock is compounded by taking this charismatic hero whos all about his badassery and showing that at the end when you have a beast gouging your eyes out you scream just like any other human  wanting the pain to end thats whats so crushing about the scene it takes this almost too typical hero character and brings him right back to reality with a grizzly death "

"1188" "Bluedylan" 2014-06-02 " genuinely gutted to see oberyn die and the manor in which it took place on reflection i think it was inkeeping with the tone of the show dont get too attached to anyone the red vipers character all skill and swagger but just a tad overconfident and a bit too prideful the mountains reputation savage until the end and tyrions beetle crushing story its a cruel senseless world where sometimes a simpleton kills beetles because he can and because he wants to still i loved oberyn from the first moment he arrived and im a bit heartbroken dany getting rid of ser jorah was also hard to swallow but entirely understandable from her pov because she has been betrayed and endangered and she did care for him as a friend so its complete betrayal and weve all known this for a long time she only just found this out while it may not be wise for her its understandable that shes so distraught that she just wants him out of her sight props to iain glen and emilia clarke for a beautifully acted scene ill really miss ser jorah and hope he comes back elsewhere dont particularly care about grey worm and missandei at this point personally just havent connected with the characters yet im also similarly underwhelmed by gilly and sam at this point but in both storylines im open to see where things go and then theres sophie turner doing another stellar job in the transformation of sansa even though i knew she was lying i still felt myself welling up at her teary confession which is quite something is she becoming a maleficent type with the dark clothes and dark hair will arya get into the eyrie and finally see her big sis honestly dont know where thats all going apart from thinking that littlefinger has plans to teach robyn to get in dangerous isolated circumstances but cant wait to find out where thats all going and loved the ramseyroose scenes on the moors creepy as they are its not fun to see the flayed man sigil flowing through the north fantastic episode of a superb series "

"1227" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-02 " oh absolutely thats definitely how i saw it that and isnt it all completely absurd "
"1228" "RedHerrings" 2014-06-02 " anyone else think the exploding skull was a bit ott "
"1229" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-02 " it does  i write these things in a mad rush and then realise that they are way over length and something has to go but i do feel bad about not giving alfie allen his due as hes been excellent "
"1230" "otcdave" 2014-06-02 " is it just me who thought that part at least of aryas laugh was aimed at the hound  he has spent a hell of a long time leading her around westeros looking to ransom her and every time he gets close the potential payer has just been whacked "
"1231" "dsk84" 2014-06-02 " there was a line thrown in the episode that eludes to the moment you mentioned too made me chuckle "
"1232" "MMGALIAS" 2014-06-02 " httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvqaxzwlg9nqfeaturekp sorry my bad my head is all over the place after that episode "
"1233" "ScotiaNova" 2014-06-02 " i hope its the same one i think itll be    and then doofdoofdoof    eastenders theme    "
"1234" "Muppet_N2" 2014-06-02 " did have a bit about alfie in the initial blog but i cut it happens all the time "
"1235" "ScotiaNova" 2014-06-02 " didnt they fight in the tourney in season 1    after the mountain lopped off the head of his horse    "
"1236" "Haphazard85" 2014-06-02 " all i know is the last scene of episode 10 will be a truly holy shit moment not that there werent enough already rip oberyn well played pedro pascal he really brought the character to life onwards to mance and the wall then "
"1237" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-02 " i agree  actually i did have a bit about alfie in the initial blog but i cut it for space i think his performance has been excellent this season "
"1238" "ocelot75" 2014-06-02 " swisschocolate  totally agree with you re sansa that was one of my many wtf moments of this episode "
"1239" "Jez Holland" 2014-06-02 " i agree that aryas laugh was perfection just one of the many stellar performances this week though it feels like characters that have been mere background characters in previous seasons are coming more and more to the fore what with sansas turn to dark sansa and alfie allen quietly plugging away at his portrayal of reek i have been purposefully avoiding talking about the fight as there is a risk that it becomes the only thing that happened in the episode all i will say on it is it felt the same way as reading it in the books to me a spot on portrayal i couldnt put the book down when i reached that part in the same way i couldnt take my eyes away from the screen i would also like to say that pascals performance is a benchmark for him whenever i see him in anything else it will not compare the last season of the mentalist i am looking at you in particular "
"1240" "Gantsara" 2014-06-02 " nice work by alfie allen showing reek just barely holding himself together to portray theon when you compare this theon to the swaggering cocky season 1 theon i think allen deserves more credit than he gets "
"1241" "Adam Dickes" 2014-06-02 " as happy as g r r m is to kill off our favourite characters surely he cant kill tyrion quite yet not after he has defied so many certain death situations so far no to mention if the mountain is dead then surely his trial is a draw a hung jury will tywin change his mind then and send tywin off to the wall instead it seems a little late in the day for that a puzzle no spoilers please  i cant wait to find out "
"1242" "swisschocolate" 2014-06-02 " well wow i even sat through the theonramsey scenes in season three while calmly eating my dinner but i had to cover my eyes and look away when the mountain finished off oberyn ugh and then screamed nooooo at the screen while it stands to reason and is indeed rather awesome that got doesnt go with the welltrodden road of having the cocky underdog win oberyns death is a sad loss to the show that already lost one of the few fun characters granny olenna earlier in the season i hope it wont turn too bleak was a bit surprised that king tommen was not present at the fight nor was marge but perhaps the young actor had to be in school wasnt too upset by dany dumping ser friendzone it just confirmed my weekly growing opinion of her as an obnoxious selfrighteous brat who deserves her comeuppance bugged me a bit that he wouldnt even try to tell her how his perception of her changed yada yada or that she wouldnt demand more of an explanation on the other hand it was the first and only exciting thing to happen meereenway this season so its welcome especially as it does make me wonder what the consequences for dany will be best bit for me was in retrospect not the muchhyped fight that came across a bit clownshoes but sansa showing this new mature calculating side of hers when she saved littlefingers backside and then appeared physically transformed as well it really brought home for me that hers has been in the long run one of the most interesting story arcs from dimwitted teenager fawning over joffrey to manipulative young woman which again makes me wonder how much she ressembles cersei who must have followed a similar traject over the years learning to fight and manipulate in a thoroughly male universe "
"1243" "roganis" 2014-06-02 " actually maybe tyrions advice about not boozing before a battle might have been better heeded too much wine does make one ramble on a bitsometimes to a murderous extent "
"1244" "MMGALIAS" 2014-06-02 " the hound v the mountain thats a fight i want to see "
"1245" "ocelot75" 2014-06-02 " thank you lady sarah of the house of hughes for yet another brilliant recap im still digesting this episode there was a lot of wtf moments so manytherefore i am eagerly waiting to read what my fellow got bloggers made of this episodehuzzah "

"1252" "Noodlescheyenne" 2014-06-02 " another fantastic recap sarah i look forward to reading these just as much as the show itself a paticular nail on head part of your article spoilers as longhardened viewers of game of thrones we should be used to the idea that the good or at least the most sympathetic guys never win but the death of the prince of dorne still came as a shock – pascal brought just the right amount of swagger and style to the part and we’re conditioned through years of film and television watching to believe that the guy with the best lines will always beat the guy who grunts and hits things "
