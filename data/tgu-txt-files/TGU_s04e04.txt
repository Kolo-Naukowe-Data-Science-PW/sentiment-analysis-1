"4" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-05-04 " why dont feminists confront the actors who portray such rape scenes why are these actors given a pass when they have enormous influence visually because it would be as stupid as jews confronting actors who portray hitler "
"5" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-05-04 " very late to this episode because ive been away overall i thought it was a bit of a return to form after last weeks slight dip very well paced with some beautifully played scenes between jaime tyrion cersei bron brianne marge olenna etc some plot lines nicely launched mixed feelings about the deviations from the books which re becoming more apparent now that the writers are wrestling with the full implications of multiple plot lines spread almost randomly across multiple books on the one hand its interesting not to know whats coming next on the other its hand its a bit discomforting glad dany finally got back to doing something more than going from city gates to city gates i thought burn gorman could have done with reining it in a bit theres unhinged and then theres chewing the furniture into matchsticks the understated petty malice of the guy who plays rast was much more convincing loved his moneyshot to hodor if i was as big as you id rule the fucking world to end on a positive lucky lucky tommen i expect his servants had to snap his sheets in two to change them in the morning "
"6" "The_Wanderer" 2014-05-03 " i agree justice was a big part of the episode and loyalty aka oathkeeping seems to distort the traditional positive meaning associated with the word i wrote an in depth recapanalysis that discusses this episode and its exploration of loyalty on my site if anyones interested in reading it theres a link below httpatgreviewscomgoldarticlesgamethronesseason4episode404oathkeeper pod calling brienne ser was awesome "
"7" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-03 " now it is making dubious choices by putting in far more rape and violence than were in the books im not surprised you dont understand their choices as you clearly didnt read the books "
"8" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-03 " what could you possibly be talking about it seems the guardianistas have eliminated all references aelfwine and i made concerning the final scene making your scolding remarks appear meaningless repeat if you want to find out who that last white walker was google it hbo revealed it after the episode but apparently took it down later "

"10" "Nancykitt" 2014-05-02 " i was pleased to hear a thrones reference in wednesdays episode of coronation street however i was dismayed that sally was trying to prevent her boyfriend from taking a trip to kings landing because apparently there were more important things to do if he ever needed a reason to dump her its there for all teh world to see "

"14" "Greenseer" 2014-05-01 " yes the book scene happened in the sept and yes it happened next to joffs corpse cersei sort of resisted at first and then begged jaime to go ahead that a mother can shag over the corpse of her firstborn whatever little shit he was  and while she was menstruating  etched this foul scene into my mind beyond all grrms other foul scenes the show turned this around somewhat to evoke more sympathy for cersei she deserved none in the book as far as im concerned "
"15" "Bluedylan" 2014-05-01 " ah right didnt realise the iron islands were to the west of westeros id assumed they were between the two continents that explains it cheers "

"17" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-01 " i really disagree about this for one thing other sets of novels have personal viewpoints but also an epic charterer so i am sure it can be done the dune series the earthsea series his dark materials all have the story told from multiple character viewpoints i also always found the epic nature of the story was readily apparent in the novels even though we also get the personal and intimate there has been clear movement throughout towards the larger conflict which seems to be spiritual andor metaphysical in nature i would argue in all of these types of stories it is the connection between the personal and intimate that makes the epic sweep more evident and pronounced individuals caught up in larger events draw a connection between the personal and the events being described but also creates a contrast that reinforces the grandeur of the larger themes we see individuals being born along in the river of events outside of their control i think the show has actually had a much more difficult time communicating that epic sweep often the dragons the behavior of magic and the seasonsthe white walkers even brans visions seem like tackedon elements religion has been downplayed as a fundamental force or a source of conflict especially apart from the fire god i suspect part of it too is that we dont hear the stories the mythology to the same degree  as in the real world it is the literature and myth that communicate the more basic realities of the world we see walter frey and tywin make light of the guest right and have some idea what that might mean but we dont get to hear the story of the cook who turns into a rat which would link that clearly to larger themes "
"18" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-01 " it wasnt brought up because it wasnt officially accepted as a fact that is what it means that it is underground  people know it happens but it isnt really spoken about there are many examples of people speaking disparagingly about it it was pretty clear to me it was considered degenerate jaime mentions it in relation to oberyn at one point overall the sexual morality of westeros seems to pretty much follow what we saw in medieval europe including their views on marriage and sex its particularly noticeable whenever they talk about religion or very religious characters  baeleor the blessed stannis at times later in the books when the church plays a greater role given the historical sources for the culture i think it is pretty reasonable to think the attitudes and secrecy around homosexuality are meant to reflect a similar situation its quite different than what seems to be accepted in either dorne or the free cities or even among the dothraki where it is simply no cause for comment "
"19" "purpleheart" 2014-05-01 " jeez  so youre in the intelligent viewer and in the programme makers said this was their intention so it must be right category and im in the i should be apologising for having my own opinion category because im not as intelligent as you and dare to say that the programme makers may have misjudged and bodged something and i do understand dialogue and also recognise that a tv scene is about more than dialogue they could have included a couple more lines of dialogue as in the book if they wanted it to be clearly consensual they chose not to and chose to include a line from jaime saying i dont care when cersei was saying no and i think ill leave it there thanks im getting fed up of being told that you must be right and i must be wrong because youre so clever and intelligent having a different reading of a scene is one things being told that yours must be right because youre more intelligent is just plain rude "
"20" "ID056000" 2014-05-01 " the problem isnt the depiction of rape its the fact that the show depicted rape and the creators of the show claimed that the scene wasnt rape which is an incredibly offensive and unhelpful thing to do when real world victims of rape already have enough time getting taken seriously conversely there is no issue of murders and other acts of nonsexual violence as being claimed as nonexistent "
"21" "ID056000" 2014-05-01 " while i didnt think it was rape because of the nature of their relationship so basically what youre saying is that if a woman is in a messed up relationship with a man hes allowed to force her into nonconsensual sex and it isnt rape she said no not here and stop the sex was clearly nonconsensual and regardless of the nature of the relationship between the people involved nonconsensual sex  rape it really is that simple "
"22" "ciwstudent" 2014-05-01 " the white walkers remind me too much iron maidens mascot eddie for me to take them seriously "
"23" "Alfster" 2014-05-01 " but they messed up here  not because they dont know whats going to happen but because they misread how many viewers would read that scene i would suggest that is the fault of many viewers because i got what cerseis dialogue was saying now intelligent viewers should have gone ok i misread the scene knowing what the scene did put over as many others did read correctly i now change my position and apologise for misreading it but nojust keep blaming the programme makers for assuming their audience were clever enough to understand dialogue "
"24" "pavanne" 2014-05-01 " the blog post has the beauty of selfknowledge in the first paragraph the book series isnt perfect indeed the fourth book flags badly and clearly didnt do it for you however its one of the few things i will read and reread and still spot subleties in and the characterisation is sublime "

"26" "ModestHill" 2014-05-01 " the interior view is an enormous mistake in my opinion it means the novels can never have epic scope because they are tied to a limited personal perspective as the martin universe gets bigger and bigger our perspective upon it gets proportionally smaller and smaller this was always inevitable and a decent editor should have pointed it out to martin at the start last episodes fantastic nurembergstyle shot of daenerys on the ziggurat targaryen banner behind her is exactly the sort of viewfromnowhere storytelling sweep denied to the novels martin would need one of his characters to see it and describe it and they couldnt unless they were a dragon with an interior monologue anyway i agree with what lots have said here  as the books decline in quality the screenwriters will have to adapt and innovate more so we bookreaders probably will have some surprises to look forward to after all "
"27" "Moreisless" 2014-05-01 " has sarah offered an opinion on danielle hendersons article on too much racism and misogyny on got seems like a trolling exercise to me "
"28" "ModestHill" 2014-05-01 " id forgotten that he started out a screenwriter and still dabbles even so  that makes the excesses of the novels all the more unforgivable its possible that martin ended up writing for tv because its strict format was a way of containing his wayward sprawling tendencies same with alan moore  hes great as a graphic novelist because being forced to write a frame at a time resists his tendency to ramble id not want to read a textonly novel by him in case anyones interested i wrote a rather long piece on martins failings as a novelist here on my blog "
"29" "pavanne" 2014-05-01 " one thing to keep in mind is that in westeros homosexuality seems to be something of a taboo i dont see much evidence of that either on tv or in the books  nobody brought up homosexuality as a reason why renly shouldnt be king unless he couldnt produce an heir it seems to me that as a feudal society westeros only considers sex to be anyone elses business when it could lead to procreation with somebody important and raise questions of succession so nobilityonpeasant is unimportant just generates a few bastards peasantonpeasant is unimportant manonman and womanonwoman even more so its not very modern logic but it is at least internally consistent "

"32" "aliquidcow" 2014-05-01 " i find it very odd for a country that allegedly has free speech that you cant even mention the books on here even when there are no spoilers some people just love to moan it seems and no that is not a spoiler because that whole scene is not in the book  oh sorry am i not allowed to say that its impossible to know what you can and cant say any more i think youre struggling to understand what free speech means its not really impossible to know what you can and cant say dont talk about the books on this particular blog was the request were here to talk about the show only its quite simple "

"36" "Turinsday" 2014-05-01 " specifically dol guldur "
"37" "Jeopardy" 2014-05-01 " im not surprised you dont understand my comment as you clearly didnt read it the show used to balance light and dark much better so its clearly capable of it now it is making dubious choices by putting in far more rape and violence than were in the books  which are telling a good story so its perfectly possible to do that without being relentlessly grim and showing gratuitous rapes and acts of violence all the time nobody is asking for disney from it  youre just being daft as for titanic  its a good case in point actually one of the highest grossing movies of all times that depicted a human love story in the midst a great tragedy more human interest stories amid westeros going to hell in a handcart would make got considerably more interesting to watch than the endless festival of nasty which is what the show currently seems to be "
"38" "RoomSixteen" 2014-05-01 " however if he knows there are only a few hundred defenders theres a lot less preparation required and a lot less men will die yes i suppose so but sending out someone to deal with the mutineers seem like a steep price to pay for very little since mance rayder is going to attack the wall anyway ten men out of a hundred is a decimation of the defending force "
"39" "ACertainBang" 2014-05-01 " excellently put this is the clearest interpretation of that very divisive scene that i have read and your point is backed up by the way he addresses her formally the next time they meet and by going into gift overdrive with brienne "
"40" "BigBear63" 2014-05-01 " spoiler alert having watched e04 im disappointed about the massive illogical changes from the source material why well the books are written as if they form part of a real history and as far as i know histories are based on facts facts are logical and have consequences to change a fact but not change a consequence is both illogical and pointless to assume the changes are to somehow make the show more popular seems ludicrous when its the most popular show on the planet so why do it bran at crasters keep jons wolf captured brans wolf captured jon returning to crasters keep on the basis that the traitors must be silenced lest mance learns some secret about the walls vulnerability mance who was a black cloak for sone time not knowing unspecified secrets about the wall that the traitors who were black cloaks for 5 minutes probably do the wall which has been impregnable for thousands of years is now vulnerable because there are some sort of secrets about it the white walkers ie the others are now revealed as a bunch of adoptive parents which clearly craster was just one of a very long line of adoption agents going back tens of thousands of years absolutely pointless bollocks with no dramatic or artistic merit whatsoever will the producers suddenly have a dallas moment and reset the storyline back to the source material or will they decide to end the show in season 5 with everyone living happily ever after oh and why the fuck is sandor still alive valar morghulis sorry for spoilers "
"41" "purpleheart" 2014-05-01 " and in general i think theyre doing a great job  editing martins sprawling plot sharpening up character arcs etc and many of the changes have worked well but they messed up here  not because they dont know whats going to happen but because they misread how many viewers would read that scene "

"44" "elleesse" 2014-04-30 " ive been bothered from the start with the naked women as set dressing the giggling prostitutes up for it all the time happy clappy but never contracting the clap in their jobs i mentioned this before but please balance out with some diseased prostitutes desperate ones forced into doing it for money rather than perfect grinning women loving their job up for it all the time no matter what or whom they have to have sex with if thats not some stupid male fantasy put up on screen i dont know what is and if youre going to show so much gratuitous female flesh then balance that out with male flesh too i get the strong feeling the directors allow their inner teenage boy to spring free and take over once too often without thinking ever that much of their audience is female and that its simply boring for that demographic apart from anything else i also find it really distracting and miss half the dialogue when people are doing other things sex included in the background agree that the rape scene at crastors in the last episode was the worst i found it very disturbing and sickening to watch i know there was the flaying of theon and beheadings etc but the same casual raping of men isnt shown in gotnot that i want to see that but im pretty sure that would have been happening too as pepa01 said in her original post but it seems the scenes in crastors were partly an excuse to show some bare breasts again which is rather a horrifying thought considering the context think it could have been shown in a different way and had the same impact without the feeling of oh look boobs muddled in with rape i guess they are making us hate the crastors keep gang as much as is humanly possible so we dont feel guilty about being happy to see them i presume killed in various horrific ways in a future episode by john snow and his followers "
"45" "elleesse" 2014-04-30 " i thought the same about the chanting when it was presented before that crasters daughters werent so happy with handing their babies over as a sacrifice now it seemed as if they accepted it as ritualised and normal wonder if these zombie babies will kill their own mothers if they later meet them or turn them into wights or will they even recognise them if they can be whitewalkerised with one touch of a grey claw fingernail can they be magically rehumanised "
"46" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-30 " fair point although i would say theres no disparity in my world i felt pity for joffreys death and pity for his mother watching her son die and this blog discussed that i dont think murder is justified regardless if how unpleasant the character similarly i think due to poor directing confused writing jaime  cerseis scene last week was a rape i also dont think crucifying 163 people is justice and i think it will have repercussions "
"47" "JennM" 2014-04-30 " i thought it interesting that sansa was so quick to catch on  also im wondering what with little fingers huge ambitions  what her life will be worth once its known her two brothers are still alivealso marjory  here i was thinking she was in cahoots with her grandmother and it turns out she is not scheming but sweet  and naive  so im a bit worried about her wthout her granny around she may get into trouble i didnt think that jamie forcing himself on his sister was any more shocking than thie former incest  all she had to do was scream and the guards would have chopped him to pieces  white cloak or no white cloak  and cercie knew this so many people have gone all squeamish about this  saying rapists cannont be redeemed and more such rubbish what about murder more than half the characters in the show actually killed someone and i dont hear too much about how monsterous poisoning a 16 year old boy makes one little old lady from high garden cercie will get over it  joffrey is dead "
"48" "rickyredmanc" 2014-04-30 " i remember mr martin saying the books and the tv show should be viewed as two separate entities i know what you mean with a show as vast a scope as this one its difficult to follow everything "
"49" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-30 " i think it was mentioned in passing earlier in the series but yes it was a major issue in the book i seem to recall it was a big part of why she went into meereen at all "
"50" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-30 " thats my feeling i dont generally worry about plot deviations and some are expected books translated to screen will pretty much always have fewer characters or timelines shifted and battles usually have to be approached differently the thing is the tone of the story the themes the major plot outlines and character arcs depending on the type of story some of those will be more important than others i even liked dune and that did a pretty serious hatchet job in many ways but it managed to preserve the tone  that sense of grandeur and real alieness  that was such a big part of the story and would have been the easy part to get wrong  like that awful miniseries version with game of thrones they have actually been remarkably faithful most decisions about translation were well handled and the themes and character arcs and even plotting are largely maintained there are occasionally errors in tone i think particularly where they shoehorn in obviously 21st century pornlike sex the big advantage to the books in my view  and its always the case i would say with books narrated by characters  is the interior view that is after all why we have novels  it is what they offer us compared to theater there are a few places i think where the show fails to make something make sense because they have not adequately externalized something that was internal they dont always have to of course actions can remain ambiguous or open to interpretation but i dont think viewers should be left really confused by what people do "
"51" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-30 " oops that was meant for the comment above though i enjoy the books and show pretty equally "
"52" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-30 " yup i think you are right about the power dynamic i wonder if he was really even looking for the upper hand or if he just wanted a more even relationship "

"55" "Jez Holland" 2014-04-30 " oh and i do agree that dany was wrong for a start she seems to have a skewed vision of what constitutes justice imo an eye for an eye isnt justice it is punishment justice would have been to make the masters slaves and man a nice creche in the city for the remaining freed slave children "
"56" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-30 " yes it did happen in the sept where the dead body was but they did it on the altar "
"57" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-30 " oh i dont expect it to be a simple redemption story  that is the thing about real redemption stories they happen despite the difficulties of the situation and personal limits its really about that turning and looking at the self clearly and then turning in a different direction and figuring out how to make it work and maybe healing the wounds of the past  internal and the ones caused to others i am sure that jaimes privileged position has been a big part of his situation he never really had to struggle about the basics cutting off his hand seems to have finished off the last possibility of maintaining his selfimage as a warrior though i agree with you entirely about the hound i think he probably had a very different temperament as a child i dont know if he thought about staying seriously or not  based on the book id say yes but maybe decided not to because he wants to get arya to the vale sooner rather tan later "

"60" "pipdog" 2014-04-30 " i have to disagree with you i have read the books and no way does that detract from my enjoyment of the tv series all you have to do is keep an open mind and not think that the storyline is going to slavishly follow the books to be quite honest that would be almost impossible because from book four onwards i began to think that grrm was quite literally losing the plot almost as if he was so bound up in the intricacies of his invented world that hed forgotten he was supposed to be supplying the reader with a narrative "

"62" "dsk84" 2014-04-30 " a defending force of 1000 is fairly decent if you consider how sturdy the wall is numbers will be seriously depleted and certain preparation is required mance isnt the type who wouldnt care if most of his followers die trying to capture it sure he isnt afraid of losing men but wouldnt lead them to the slaughter if he can avoid it however if he knows there are only a few hundred defenders theres a lot less preparation required and a lot less men will die he may well feel that the number of men hell lose now is below the amount he was willing to lose "

"66" "Alfster" 2014-04-30 " the jaime rape scene is a good example of one where i gather it wasnt supposed to be seen that way by the audience well thats the fault of the audience i would say the dialogue from cersei certainly was essentially no not here in from of joffreys body rather than no i dont want to have sex with you at alllets pop back to my place the programme makers by season 4 have presumably assumed they have an audience who is intune with the levels of violence and the subtleties in the story otehrwise they probably wouldnt have lasted til season 4 "
"67" "Alfster" 2014-04-30 " well of course there would never be any critical analysis at all if we all just thought that they must always know best or only say the things we liked there is a difference between analysing and saying the prgramme makers made a mistale and were totally wrong in what they did with jaimethey do actually know what is going to happen "
"68" "zephirine" 2014-04-30 " the jamie lannister story arc is a bit of a mess though its almost like last weeks crime never happened in the minds of the writers in the context of this weeks return to his redemption storyline last week seems even more of a misstep i read it as last week he seized power sexually  even if we were meant to think that cersei was willing or partly willing  and by doing so he ended their relationship now she hates him because she cant control him any more of course i could be wrong but it seemed to me their incestuous affair is now finished for ever i didnt find the rape scene pleasant obviously but it felt believable to me as jaime consciously destroying what has been the most important thing in his life perhaps being around brienne has shown him what cersei is you are a hateful woman had he ever said anything like that to her before "

"79" "Clariana" 2014-04-30 " i dont understand your comments really it should be very clear by now that westeros is a world going to hell in a handcart it is still very much in throes of a civil war and there may be worse to come if you dont like grim watch disney there are going to be very few good news stories that would be like depicting a passionate love affair on the titanic wait a minute "

"83" "malevoisine" 2014-04-30 " its been a while since i read them but the impression i have of the books is that they are amazing up until about where we are with the tv series now so the second half of book 3 and then they gradually get more and more difficult to put up with i have no patience for at least 3 of the main characters storylines after that admittedly part of the problem might be that i read the first 3 in one go then affc came out about a year after that and adwd god knows how long after that so by the time i was reading books 4 and 5 i had frankly forgotten who everyone was "

"94" "elleesse" 2014-04-30 " i was relieved that he showed loyalty to tyrion i thought for a moment there last week that now that he had dealings with jaime an out of jail able to provide him with gold lannister that he might turn on his former boss an in jail and unable to provide him with gold boss bronn being a sellsword and all but phew thankfully not "
"95" "elleesse" 2014-04-30 " hahaa thats kind of hilarious that im complaining that something looks too digital when in reality its a costume i like bluegoats theory that maybe crastor caused the upsurge in the white walkers again by tossing his unwanted sons outside in the first place "

"108" "harangutan2006" 2014-04-30 " i think youre probably right but whether that was a good introduction to tanners character or a cackhanded one depends largely on what they do with him next "

"115" "harangutan2006" 2014-04-30 " and the point is thats the only thing that has made it obvious that his old self is still there and thats why im saying it was really mismanaged i think it would be a bit naive to think that anyone could change so quickly from being the sort of person who will coldly throttle his own cousin for his own interests to being a redeemed nice guy the path to jaimes redemption if such he is on will  or should anyway  but a long and hard one with a fair bit of backsliding "
"116" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-30 " of course how could i forget cosmos i dvr it it airs at the same tome as got "
"117" "dizzzz" 2014-04-30 " i am concerned about cerseis drinking sansa is still an airhead and jaime had an epiphany for some unfathomable reason maybe it was having his way with his sister and was that fairly major change necessary sorry had to type it no matter perhaps it will spur him on to saving his brother who quite frankly needs it and to quit lusting after his sister delicious villain that she is you know how good girls like bad boys welljaime is definitely conflicted thats what humanity does to a villain probably feeling bad that he pushed that poor child voyeur from the windowif his memory goes back that farsomeone has to spring tyrion things are so much more fun when hes running around loosethe original daario was much nicer eye candy and danys is ruling like a queen should showing compassion but not weaknessjon snow should have no trouble at casters keep as the mutineers are all to drunk and spent to put up much of a fightfrom a purely lustful perspective danys and the red witch hmmmmmlastly ive read all the books the show follows the story line well enough did i mention the rape scene its all about entertainment "
"118" "harangutan2006" 2014-04-30 " jaime in particular is a totally classic example  the turning point was the bath scene well thats certainly possible but i rather hope it isnt so straightforward real people tend not to have road to damascus conversions actual redemption tends to be a messy uneven business with lots of backsliding and relapsing you make a good point about jaimes self image i think he still sort of hankers to be the heroic knight that he probably dreamt of in his childhood but that certain choices and events have sort of spoiled for him his evident regret about his almostempty page in the kings guard book speaks volumes there in brienne he sees an image of what might have been and part of him thinks it still might be but another part of him believes that he will carry the kingslayer tag to his grave whatever else he achieves which in turn might lead to the cynicism  an easy and tempting path given the influence of his father and sister i also think lingli is right about the sense of entitlement that sometimes shines through its an interesting conflict within the character and one that i wouldnt want to see resolved in too pat a fashion the hound in the tv series anyway i see as someone who has had to work hard to be as cynical as hes had to become it isnt his default setting but hes logically convinced that the world is a hard tough hobbesian nightmare of a place and that only fools believe otherwise i dont think he enjoyed robbing the villager at all and he certainly didnt enjoy arya seeing him do so but in his mind thats just how things are did he even for a moment seriously consider his offer of a life of honest toil ior were we just meant to think so any glimpses of genuine kindness  towards sansa and arya  are stamped down as soon as they flare up because that way lies weakness and vulnerability and early death while jaime is battling against his dark impulses sandor is sort of battling against his finer ones of course these are just my hunches about it  i could be way wide of what grrm or the screenwriters or actors think is going on "
"119" "dsk84" 2014-04-30 " it is interesting that he himself has doubts about the strength of the said army not sure if this would be considered spoilerish but i heard it on the blue rays so i assume its fine but youd get commentaries for each region and little finger narrated the one for the vale he was pretty dismissive of how insular the area was as a whole and mocked the fact that no one was able to subdue the hill people till tyrion did "
"120" "dizzzz" 2014-04-30 " well not that it does theon much good or make him feel any better but it was a good sized sausage "
"121" "ModestHill" 2014-04-30 " yes thats fair  its a matter of taste i suppose it would be better to say bear in mind that if you read the books you wont be able to enjoy the series in the way you did before thats not to say you wont enjoy it you just wont enjoy it in the same way  ie itll remove a lot of the suspense because watching a series over ten weeks is inevitably more suspenseful than reading a book in two or three nights and its all too easy to do wolf down martins books as with fantasy generally "
"122" "Rini" 2014-04-30 " im very disturbed by the scenes at crasters keep the raping taunting hodor and the seemingly eager offering of the naked baby in the snow i desperately want to know whats in store for the characters weve come to know and of course no one is compelling me to watch but tbh since the ramsaytheon scenes in s3 the violence has been too much to stomach "

"128" "Dukered" 2014-04-29 " ill say it again if youre thinking about reading the books  dont weekly instalments of taut tv screenwriting that you savour rather than binge on is a vastly better way of enjoying the story it depends what people enjoy there is so much more to enjoy in the books than you could ever fit on screen but of course on screen you can more easily create a sense of drama and shock value i enjoyed reading the books of the first 3 seasons which i had already seen on tv and equally i am enjoying the tv show still after having read all the books you can easily appreciate them in different ways and neither one ruins the other not for me anyway "
"129" "gojiratapir" 2014-04-29 " do the fucking font color 000000jobfont "
"130" "Dukered" 2014-04-29 " fair points alfster but i dont subscribe to the view that it must be so simply because thats how it came across on screen the jaime rape scene is a good example of one where i gather it wasnt supposed to be seen that way by the audience i honestly cant speak for the screenwriters intentions but in any case that scene was only an example i gave  my whole point wasnt based on it i wrote last week of scenes that i thought involved clumsy writing as well but i cant be bothered to go into that again "
"131" "ModestHill" 2014-04-29 " but in the books martin could only dream of writing scenes as gripping and nasty as those in the second half of that episode were nearing the point where the books nosedive in quality but the pace of this season so far and the deviations from the book last night suggest the screenwriters know how to trim martins flab ill say it again if youre thinking about reading the books  dont weekly instalments of taut tv screenwriting that you savour rather than binge on is a vastly better way of enjoying the story "

"133" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-29 " yes it seems to bother a lot of people and i wouldnt expect them to show that sort of thing  it couldnt be done and would be unfair for all the actors but i guess for whatever reason i dont find it hard to wrap my head around in some ways i find some of our customs  ike discouraging people to marry until they are in their late 20s or so much more odd our culture is really the odd one out in delaying partnerships and childbearing so long and considering people youth until they are 30 "
"134" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-29 " i dont particularly like the excessive use of naked women as setdressing i think that aspect is a bit of a problem to some extent it is a matter of degree  i suspect that there is somewhat less interest by women in seeing a lot of randomly naked men i dont really like it when it seems they are relying on it too much to be edgy though in this context i actually dont mind the scene at crasters as much as some of the ones in the brothel it has a point  things were pretty awful there the stuff in the brothel as often as not is eye candy and sometimes oversweet "
"135" "MarkRobotArm" 2014-04-29 " loved this episode apart from the white walkers they are just too cgid for me apparently theyre not cgi theyre blokes in suits with a little touching up in postproduction just heard one of the producers  chris newman i think  discussing the scene "

"142" "purpleheart" 2014-04-29 " well its not obvious is it if the director said it was consensual and so did the show runners and thats not it is in the book and not what the majority of us saw and the point is thats the only thing that has made it obvious that his old self is still there and thats why im saying it was really mismanaged complexity and shades of grey and a redemptive arc have been messed up mightily "

"147" "Lingli" 2014-04-29 " but that itself is troubling the show does have something of a history of using naked women as set dressing or perhaps more so in earlier seasons having main female characters naked in scenes where their male counterparts are clothed not everyone has an issue with it  my personal feeling is that theres nothing wrong with nudity in a show like this but it should be equal opportunity nakedness however i think the scene at crasters really bothered me because this wasnt just naked women as set dressing this was rape and sexual violence as set dressing and i know it reflects the society thats being depicted the imagined society and if i dont want to watch i dont need to and his is it worse than all of the other horrors got shows but to me it seemed unnecessary  the same effect couldve been achieved without showing it so graphically  and somehow prurient and just  no "

"157" "Lingli" 2014-04-29 " and i think this is one of the difficulties with the show  its set in a world that has clear parallels with the medieval one when yes parents of noble houses did arrange marriages between children and where those marriages often took place when the kids were in their early teens as i said elsewhere life expectancy was also supershort so theres that too but were watching it through the filter of our modern morals and sensibilities and that makes it tricky "

"163" "Mirthin" 2014-04-29 " it was a bit crap looking i thought would have been better to keep the scene dark let our imaginations do the work the white walker at the beginning of the very first episode s01e01 was genuinely creepy the show has never really managed to replicate the tension of that first 10 minute prologue since the lands north of the wall never again felt so magical or dangerous "

"174" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-29 " yes i bet he was ticked about that particular incident and it may be that he wanted rid of him even before then because he saw him as someone who might be inclined to spoil his plans "

"222" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-29 " that is interesting  i thought that danys story had suddenly become much darker in this episode as far as the idea that the story is all about depressing political stuff and about how human nature is basically bad as much as good  not that you have said that but many people seem to feel it  i actually dont think that at all i find that the stories are actually fairly moralistic and have an overall positive assesment of human potential  they are overall quite hopeful "

"262" "backfromtokyo" 2014-04-29 " im not a big fan of recasting but i think the recast they did of tommen this season was necessary and has worked cant say the same for new daario  and i didnt even like the old one they could recast myrcella too if they need to since we havent seen her for such a long time i dont think it will matter too much either way  audiences are already accustomed to supertall sansa and voicebroken bran theyll go with it "
"263" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-29 " jaime and the hound are both i would say in the middle of a story about redemption and theon as well jaime in particular is a totally classic example  the turning point was the bath scene the reason people are so attracted to them is that they of all the characters not including theon here are idealists who are faced with a pretty clear perception of the problems integrating that with reality although they choose a cynical approach to life in response they in a real way maintain that idealistic vision much more so than some of the more obviously good characters the interesting thing is to see if they will come to integrate their idealism with their lives in a more effective way that first however requires the shattering of their cynicism  looking at it for what it is and coming out the other side jaime did it in his confession to brienne in the baths like a baptism  well see if the hound gets there or just becomes totally depraved theon wasnt an idealist in the same way but he was trying very hard to be a good son and was prevented from doing so by a bad father  a similar situation a keenly felt contrast between the ideal and actual he has now seen what he was but its unclear whether there is anything left to pull back together interestingly they all suffered from inadequate family models or abuse bronn was never an idealist  hes just smart and charismatic "

"266" "Dukered" 2014-04-29 " wow really enjoyed this weeks episode  not that i normally dont but for once everything seemed to have a purpose and generally worked  i totally agree this week every plot line seemed to have a clear direction last weeks episode felt like a filler where nothing of substance happened "

"271" "Dukered" 2014-04-29 " i think the dragons and white walkers are fine but the direwolves are all wrong they should be much biggerthey are basically just dogs on the tv show with no presence at all they are supposed to be huge and intimidating beasts horses men and other dogs are supposed to tremble with fear in their presence wich doesnt come across at all on screen "

"277" "pavanne" 2014-04-29 " im still wondering why if you want to poison someone at a feast where you are a guest you need to sneak the poison in disguised as jewels on somebody else its not like olenna couldnt have had a little gem sewn into her own sleeve which would have reduced the risk of a olenna being unable to retrieve the stone subtly or b sansa nervously sucking the necklace and expiring unprettily the only possible reason seems to be to make sansa seem complicit either in her own eyes or if caught to the lannisters but its still a massive risk big deviation from the books learning margaery wasnt in on it "

"283" "Alfster" 2014-04-29 " because as you said we already have more rate of female sexual assault blame the media for that because that is all that seems important there is lots of violence in this show and it is bias and in the case of sexual assault trivialized and it is harmful to do so only when some people cant tell the difference between a fictional story and real lifethis is a fictional story where brutallty is rife if you think it is biased and hence do not agree with itstop watching it would seem the large majority of people are able to put it into the context of a fictional and very interesting show "
"284" "longtimelurker93" 2014-04-29 " the most distressed ive felt since watching got red wedding aside because of the scenes with the baby im still confused as to what the white walker dressed in black leather did to him ill admit i let out a moan when the episode started with daenerys but her scenes were better than i expected to be fair did anyone else wonder what locke was doing there maybe we were meant to think that glad jaime is back to his relatively good ways and had time for his brother ps poor hodor "
"285" "aliquidcow" 2014-04-29 " do you know what else is realistic child rape and man rape both happen a lot in war do you know what else is realistic homosexual relationships and again man rape in places where there are only man like the church the jail the army and the knight watch child rape is referenced in the dialogue for example the last section of season 4 episode 1 and more so in the books but its hugely problematic to depict on film for what i think are obvious reasons homosexual relationships what you mean like loras tyrell and renly baratheon back in season 2 or oberyn currently its fairly reasonable that theyre less prominent as people in that kind of society would generally have not been open about homosexuality "
"286" "Lingli" 2014-04-29 " thats a really good point because i think the thing that bronn the hound and jaime all have in common is that they put their own interests first for bronn its probably partly survival and partly profession  hes a sellsword after all and he wouldnt be much good at it if he wasnt able to resist the pull of the causes hes paid to fight the hound is pretty much all about survival and no wonder jaime  well theres an element of that in him too but hes also from a different social strata and has a sense of entitlement that in many ways makes his utter disregard for people in his way worse "
"287" "malevoisine" 2014-04-29 " i have a suspicion that coldhands will appear towards the end of the series but that his appearance has been delayed because it will be much more difficult to conceal his true identity in the tv series than in the book "
"288" "Pepa01" 2014-04-29 " actually not child rape is far more frequent than adult women rape in a peaceful society like western europe 80 of the rapes are committed when the victim is younger than 18 an the child rape becomes massive during wars also man rape is more frequent than you think and the figures are known to be far lower than the real rates because implications of the social tabu so you have no idea of what are you talking aboutthere is lots of violence in this show and it is bias and in the case of sexual assault trivialized and it is harmful to do so because as you said we already have more rate of female sexual assault "
"289" "HonestIago" 2014-04-29 " i meant i wanted to kill myself because it got depressing with all the rape babyabandoning and hodorwounding after an unusually hopeful series of scenes in kl and meereen it was an abrupt tonal shift as you say it was compelling i even quite like book bran and the glimpse into the white walkers was awesome it just made me feel bad "
"290" "harangutan2006" 2014-04-29 " i guess some of the issue last week was that the rape was carried out by what some people were coming to see as a sympathetic character whereas this weeks were by unambiguously horrible bad guys bad guys doing bad things probably isnt so challenging as sortofsometimes good guys doing them theres also the fact that the sept scene wasnt depicted as rape in the book and i guess some people were wondering about the need to change it "

"295" "Lingli" 2014-04-29 " i suppose it depends what they do with them now theyve got them there  but i agree for the moment it does look a bit  convenient shall we say given that jon is also on his way there the problem is that the alternative is basically bran and co trudging on through the snow which is not all that interesting especially considering most of his plot last season also consisted of a lot of trudging i was going to add a final sentence but then i thought it might be considered a spoiler so im restraining myself "
"296" "purpleheart" 2014-04-29 " thanks sarah for another good blog thanks also for the reminder to those that want to speak in code and initials to go and do that elsewhere ive read all the books so havent been able to join in some of the speculation eg re joffreys death but was therefore intrigued by this weeks deviations in the main i agree that the show has done much of the editing that would have made the books stronger  for example cerseis character is far more interesting in the tv series than in the books sometimes the show merely highlights what were problems in the books  the drawn out nature of danys narrative for example and how it makes her seem somewhat passive to be repeating the same story whilst martin is getting other narratives in the right place for the last stages i agree with the posts made about how the story in the north is less gripping than it should be particularly in comparison to the goings on in kings landing i also agree that reducing the story of the white walkers and sam in the way they did was an error i think that contributed to me finding the ending last night intriguing rather than spine chilling im with sarah is still thinking the rape scene last week was completely mismanaged by the director as was the discussions re intent by him and the show runners since the complexity of jaimes character is one of the most intriguing turnarounds in the book and that scene was bodged completely nobody is pretending to forget what jaimes done in the past but the example of brienne has made him start to think about wanting to do the right thing standing up to tywin about continuing his current role is key in that respect he wants to be honourable he wants to keep his oaths and that story was undermined by the handling of this scene with cersei last week great acting in the various pairings  jamie and tyrion in particular peter dinklage is always excellent but the way they managed to convert a long standing intimacy is a short scene was very impressive "
"297" "harangutan2006" 2014-04-29 " thanks i think someone said it above but its interesting how badly we want some of the characters to turn out ok jaime and the hound are key examples the first hint of kindness and were all me included so quick to forget about the murdered and crippled children the strangled cousins etc maybe its because were so unaccustomed to seeing nuanced bad guys in cinema and though its changing tv a character who starts doing nice things must be changing into a nice guy if he goes back to doing badguy things were all at sea or maybe its because they are in very different ways quite charismatic actors or maybe its because we want the hopes invested in them by genuinely good people  brienne and arya  not to be dashed both jaime and sandor reminded us last week that they are still quite capable of being utter shits it was uncomfortable viewing but maybe it was necessary im now wondering if bron is next up for the same treatment "

"301" "Alfster" 2014-04-29 " i mentioned the rape of crasters wives and not just in the violence count that scene was very disturbing but shouldnt we be having separate leader columns and articles on child rape is still child rape i know you did not majorly highlight last weeks i am merely being slightly devils advocate about the hyperbole that it created everywhere i find it some what tiresome when one type of violence in a show is picked out as being specifially bad compared with other eg the slaughter of a whole family and its army at the red wedding anyway i really dont want to get the rape conversation going on again too muchbut im amazed that people can pick out certain scenes in this show as being less or more disturbing than other scenes like daenerys crucifying 163 people just to make a point is that more or less disturbing than raping a dozen or so girls "
"302" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-29 " i also found it difficult to watch although part of me wondered if being a white walker might not be better than being at crasters keep btw to original poster  it wouldnt matter if cersei was the most evil person on westeros she still wouldnt deserve to be raped similarly i dont like theon doesnt mean i think his balls should be cut off i find it a bizarre argument that something is ok if the person it happens to is horrible which coming back to this episode is why i think dany is utterly wrong to crucify the masters "
"303" "Alfster" 2014-04-29 " changing topic what it is with this show and woman rape it is really necessary to show it so much and please dont tell me that is realistic because do you know what else is realistic child rape and man rape well its a a power thing and b it has happened in two backtoback episodes the cersei rape has now been shown to have major repurcussions in the story and the rapes at the keep child rape most likely will as well and remember last year theon greyjoy was about to be man rapeda few days before he had his penis chopped off there are lots of disagreeble things that happen in the showto focus on one thing does seem to miss the point that it is a violent world that is depicted and raping females has always been a power thing men tend to be killed quickly to get rid of threatsor tortured and maimed for the power too it is not bias it is as you say realisticfemale rape happens a lot more than man and child rape both of which have happened in the show did you make comment on theon murdering and burning the farmers childrenor is murder of children ok in a story like this and not of the same severity as female rape a story should not just include homosexual rape "
"304" "madraykin" 2014-04-29 " they had to age up dany so she was 16 when she married drogo so shes presumably at least 18 now possibly 19 its not clear how thats affected everyone elses ages though sansa did say she was 13 at some point last season though iirc "

"309" "Alfster" 2014-04-29 " i see after last weeks media storm about the rape theres been nothing about the mass repeated gang raping of young girls going on at crasters keep which should be far more shocking than last weeksor is it that it was just literally in background and hence people couldnt cope with taking in what was going on elsewhere in the scenesor that noone cares about faceless nameless innocent extras being raped only someone who one knows the name of oh superb episode by the way  lots of brilliant one on one conversations  jaime and tyrions talk was incredibly storng and telling of their relationship the crasters keep scenes ratchetting up the forboding for the eventually presumed battle and with a sweary speech to win the sweary speech of the year award and the mass raping might even setup the girls killing the men at some point "

"345" "justonabreak" 2014-04-29 " great opportunity for jon to warg into ghost for the first time too "
"346" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-29 " yep indeed many deviations all absolutely necessary as i doubt there will be infinite seasons things could really ramp up and to where i dont know by season end "
"347" "JBGrenouille" 2014-04-29 " do you have any enthusiasm to still read the books then now the series is on tv and into season 4 "
"348" "justonabreak" 2014-04-29 " in the books sam never told jon that he met bran as hes sworn to secrecy as far as jon is concerned bran and rickon were killed at winterfell by theon "
"349" "mightymoyes" 2014-04-29 " the mutineers at crasters know the black watch are down to their bare bones in numbers but jon told mance they are over 1000 strong at the wall thats the key info jon doesnt want mance to learn "
"350" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-29 " ive read the books and to be honest theyre so vast ive forgotten most of it its a bad sign when youre surprised by the red wedding twice heck it took me most of the episode to recognise locke "
"351" "BishopLenBrennan" 2014-04-29 " well the timeline is a bit skewed so this point in the show and the book arent really directly comparable but id say that no jon doesnt know that bran is alive at a comparable stage in the books sam keeps that quiet in the books thats what confused me most about the episode last night than jon knew bran was out there somewhere "
"352" "Chillingworth" 2014-04-29 " tremendous well played "
"353" "aliquidcow" 2014-04-29 " maybe im totally missing something but i was a little confused as to why crasters women were so set on offering up their babies as sacrifices now i was under the impression that they were being forced to do it before  hence samwell helping rescue gillys baby with craster gone why have they changed their tune "
"354" "bjammin187" 2014-04-29 " have to disagree have to listen to the whole thing great bit of music that gets me right in the mood "

"356" "ViolentDelights" 2014-04-29 " do we know for sure that dany cant have more children i wasnt certain about whether the whole demon baby had made her infertile or not "
"357" "ViolentDelights" 2014-04-29 " oh yes i dont read them til ive seen the episode either ive read the first two books but dont want to read ahead as i enjoy being surprised when its on tv i completely agree with you on the last point "
"358" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-29 " i think the scene with tommen was done well margery is obviously taking her grandmothers advice in a subtle way but it was tempered well enough and more intending to control tommen now and forever more rather than inappropriate behaviour dany does indeed seem to be doing a shake and vac on every city she meets its all getting a bit grrr alright maybe she should listen to ser baristan "
"359" "bjammin187" 2014-04-29 " i honestly dont think there is any romantic love between brienne and jaime it is just a very intense bond they forged on the road together they saved each others livesand they see in each other a means to find a way to be a better person "

"361" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-29 " unfortunately no that would have been a huge improvement "
"362" "Moreisless" 2014-04-29 " a few of points on last nights episode which was really good apart from the crasters keep scenes a bit ott1 even if dany gets to westeros and wins the throne she cannot produce a heir so she really is the last dragon and her entire story line is really similar to robert even if she wins in the end what comes next will be chaos2 the look on tommens face as the scene with margaery progressed was priceless 3 the fact that littlefinger has told sansa what and who killed joffrey is very significant he doesnt seem like someone who would reveal his plans to anyone other than a coconspirator4 maybe grey worms gelding was botched the way he looks at missendei is not very asexual5 i really hope that jon rescues brann but this being got we might not the emotional payoff we expect6 tyrion explicitly told jaime that he did not kill joffrey "
"363" "Katheartsboo" 2014-04-29 " littlefinger would let the kingdom burn if he could reign over the ashes "
"364" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-29 " i think the north seemed to be getting exciting again i agree bran is exciting as an allbran breakfast however even though its all going down up north its been kind of neglected generally because all the interesting characters are in kings landing weve seen the dragons now we appear to be seeing their enemy for tv i think the cgi has been pretty good and better than a lot of movies "
"365" "aliquidcow" 2014-04-29 " it was noted in last weeks blog or the week before i cant remember that wilko johnson who plays ilyn payne has been diagnosed with terminal cancer which probably explains the alteration from the book "
"366" "pipdog" 2014-04-29 " the tv show is starting to go its own way with some aplomb the action is sticking to the point the plotlines are less muddied and we might even come to a splendid conclusion  all of those things increasingly problematical as you progress through the books "
"367" "londonhongkong" 2014-04-29 " haha indeed but a wink and nod is enough "
"368" "redmal" 2014-04-29 " in regard to rickon and osha it gets like that in the books people disappear for ages never to to heard of againthe giants are still with mance rayder who seems to have gone missing too as well as asha who was on her way to liberate her brother when last seen also no mention of whats happening to edmure tully "
"369" "Katheartsboo" 2014-04-29 " bran asks sam to not reveal that hes alive to jon in the books im hoping that theyre going to just miss each other jon and his merry band will attack bran et al will run off in the confusion but theyll never actually see each other feels a bit off to have them meet up "
"370" "Elquesodiablo" 2014-04-29 " i know this is going to be skirting the book issues thing but as a book reader im intrigued about whether a couple of elements in this episode have solidified andor spoiled things for the book crowd "
"371" "VonSparron" 2014-04-29 " the chief bastard of the band formerly of the nights watch graced us with a decent splattering of the cbomb so i didnt miss the hound too much "
"372" "aliquidcow" 2014-04-29 " perhaps john cleese could have turned up as a roman centurion and corrected the grammar "
"373" "pipdog" 2014-04-29 " i loved the look on tommens face scared out of his wits yet clearly fascinated clever touch yet again with sir pounce on screen while margaery was acting like a giant cat playing with a very small mouse "
"374" "Lingli" 2014-04-29 " oh i agree  i think jons notsomerry band will arrive in the nick of time but like arya at the twins theyll somehow miss bran and he and hodor and the reeds will continue north although it would probably be worse if bran does see jon and manages to persuade jon to let him go oh dear  "
"375" "JBGrenouille" 2014-04-29 " i share your pain i only read these comments section once i have seen the episode myself anyone that has read the books the smug bunch and feels the need to write spoilers i think karma will get them and end up like theon greyjoy "
"376" "Drgonzo123" 2014-04-29 " i mean blackfish went for slash never to be seen againgendry and brotherhood without banners also could do with a hello "
"377" "PatriciaPJ" 2014-04-29 " i think littlefinger will be the making of sansa making as in honing into a perfect weapon of revenge and duplicity  i also think meeting up with her mad aunty might teach her a thing or two brienne will find her im sure although i am doubtful that sansa will welcome her i thought that dany did the right thing under the circumstances although suspect that there will be consequences when is jaime going to be married off "
"378" "VonSparron" 2014-04-29 " i disagree with that i think the white walkers have been great im just wondering what the others in black are white walkers or something else "
"379" "ViolentDelights" 2014-04-29 " sorry i was just frustrated usually the comments on this are fairly well moderated and it did seem that people were finally starting to obey the tv pace rule so it was annoying to come on and see spoiler after spoiler last night "
"380" "VonSparron" 2014-04-29 " i think the white walkers have been realised really well "
"381" "Lingli" 2014-04-29 " i didnt think it was a particularly strong episode compared to this shows usual standards the scenes in kings landing were good overall the scenes in meereen were fine  its not a storyline im especially interested in but they seem to be trotting through it  although i could have done without the crucifixions i liked the juxtaposition between the desert and the wall  but i dont understand the whole returning to crasters keep storyline once bran was captured and i do understand including that because as so many people have said otherwise its just more trudging through the snow for most of a season im guessing its a way to have him rescued in one form or another but the strategic reason for jon to go back to crasters makes no sense to me he says mance is coming the brothers at crasters will have vital tactical information and we have to get to them before the king beyond the wall does except mance was a member of the black watch he knows all about the wall and the watchs tactics and even if he didnt  well whats the tactical mystery its a 700foot high wall made of ice theres a gate through it at castle black plus the ones at eastwatchbythesea and  i forget the name of the western one and hes already sent ygritte and the wildlings  plus the thenns  to open that from the south what can the men at crasters know thats going to be of any use i know its a small point overall but it irritates me because unless jon has some sort of ulterior motive yet to be revealed hes smarter than that "
"382" "Drgonzo123" 2014-04-29 " also wheres the tullys and ironborn sometimes feel qe get introduced to characters start to like them or at least get to know them and then they disappear for ages in the meantime we are introduced to new characters we have to get used to before they disappear i suppose its what happens when you have such a rich source to tap "
"383" "JBGrenouille" 2014-04-29 " oh dear you seem to have taken my comment to heart i was merely saying that everything cant be moderated and looked after as its a comments section i feel your frustration in regards to spoilers too no offense was meant my ladysir "
"384" "VonSparron" 2014-04-29 " ooooh well that was a bit different wasnt it im glad weve veered a bit off book here because now i can wildly speculate with everyone else about whats going to happen because i have no idea anymore they had better not hurt hodor though that bit was horrible in a show where most characters are shades of grey the former nights watch are obvious baddies they have gone totally feral in a lord of the fliesapocalypse now sort of way im surprised there hasnt been more discussion about the bit with the white walker it looked to me like the white walker and the others  who took the baby werent in the same place maybe that stone circle is some kind of gateway between realms maybe i am going a bit too high fantasy but thats what i saw what was everyone elses interpretation tommen is so sweet ser pounce margaery was borderline creepy but im sure tommen wont mind her sneaking into his bed chamber lucky bugger danny showing that she may be mother and breaker of chains but she is still very much a targaryan impressive turnaround on the banner too farewell queen of thorns you have been great value well miss ya "
"385" "LordMeowingtons" 2014-04-29 " hodor "
"386" "Drgonzo123" 2014-04-29 " with dany running around essos you might of thought that the martells might want to make friends after all they both lost a sister inlaw to the lannisters would make sense brotherinlaw red viper for a use of a dragon now and again seems fair "
"387" "ViolentDelights" 2014-04-29 " thanks for that im not stupid i avoid other sites because i know there will be spoilers but sarah specifically says in her blog that this is at tv pace so the least people could do is be courteous and not spoil welcome to the internet aye where manners mean nothing "
"388" "Jez Holland" 2014-04-29 " i tend to hear this more game of thrones ultimate rap battle "
"389" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-29 " look everyone i am bored of having to say this every week but this is not a blog for discussing book issues etc the internet is full of places where the books and their difference from the tv show can be discussed this blog is for the tv show that means no spoilers no clever abbreviations no but if you only knew hints lets play nicely please theres tons to discuss about the show without having to spoil thanks "
"390" "Lingli" 2014-04-29 " without going into the whole in the books thing myrcella is as you say in dorne being watched over by oberyns brother prince doran because this is the way things work in westeros its entirely possible that she is in fact betrothed to someone of suitable rank in order to foster a closer alliance between the lannisters and the martells we may see i can see why the characters are aged up on the show of course but i wonder sometimes how much sense it makes in terms of our understanding of this world i mean with obvious exceptions like maester aemon 102 i think life expectancy even without a civil war is going to be less than 40 for most people so marrying in your early teens is sort of understandable really  itd be the equivalent of being about 30 now and in terms of royal engagements just look at mary queen of scots  didnt she marry the dauphin when he was about 9 not that that ended well i know that there are probably questions of what a child actor can do and whats appropriate but in some cases such as tommen that doesnt seem as important it also leads to weird dichotomies like the fact that margaery has buried two husbands without consummating either marriage but when she leaned towards tommen and whispered this is our little secret i immediately thought eeew "
"391" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2014-04-29 " well my feeling is that you can only analyse and criticise what is on the screen authorial intent is no excuse i would say i realise that the book version is much more ambiguous but surely there can be no doubt that what we saw on screen was rape i agree to an extent however the producers director etc who will have previewed several cuts would obviously have felt that they got it right in terms of the ambiguity of the source text hence they released the episode perhaps their final judgement on that was based on being too close to the show and the source material hence subsequent reaction to the scene has suggested they made a misjudgement lets not forget however it was a a very fine line they were walking even attempting ambiguity was to open themselves up to criticism that what occurred was rape however that they ultimately made a misjudgement despite that conclusion being entirely subjective does not to my mind make that scene artistically invalid "
"392" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-29 " sorry im not actually able to moderate and wasnt following the blog last night ill let them know "

"406" "FormicaAtomica" 2014-04-29 " perhaps it is coldhands that saves bran and company from the nightswatch but he hasnt met sam yet so i really really dont think bran and jon should meet does jon even know brans alive in the books cant change that surely "
"407" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-29 " i expect they will bran seems destined to be some sort of martyr figure given his story so far he has a greater purpose than most of the people in the show but if he were to run into jon there is no way jon would let him go further north knowing whats in wait for him there brans arc is a longer slower one than any in the book but its undeniably the saddest to see play out his task is one that may kill him and will almost certainly give him no glory or personal gain but still he soldiers on dragging his broken body towards the end of the world because thats his fate "
"408" "londonhongkong" 2014-04-29 " hi i think we saw the current ice king definitely i just get the feeling one of our key characters is going to end up there and yes dany is the last targaryeani think "

"421" "londonhongkong" 2014-04-29 " spoilers ahoy given the end scene of yesterdays episode and some info from the series so far i think i know what the overarching story is  the got world has a wandering sun probably due to some other bodys gravitational pull this is why you have varying length summers and winters and sometimes generational long summers and winters  the white walkers are a species which by being formed from human babies allows humans to survive the very long winters when otherwise humanity might be wiped out  so these two groups have a symbiotic but often extremely hostile relationship  hence the title of the series the song of fire  ice  i suspect at the end we will see the return of the long winter and two remaining rulers one for men one for the white walkers my moneys on dany for the first and jon snow for the second i think brans sight is to discover the truth about the relationship between humans and the white walkers and followers of the red god are a destructive force that would destroy this balance and end up with humans being wiped out in the long winter this reminds somewhat of brian aldisss helliconia series with the hostile but necessary relationship between humans and phagors and the centuries long summers and winters "

"430" "guardiansek" 2014-04-29 " i think this is one of my favorite episodes of the series so far and the best of the year lots of great moments for nikolai costerwaldau sp as jaime lannister taking turns being informed or disillusioned by his siblings adopting bronns laconic advice and friendship and especially sending brienne off on her quest to rescue sansa the fall of mereen went a little quickly but i agree that under the circumstances dany did the right thing by stringing up the slave masters its hard to imagine her doing anything else and maintaining control of her army so where is she off to next or is she being set up for a schoolofhardknocks lesson that robert baratheon never learned that winning is not the same thing as governing crasters keep was way over the top at first but it got redeemed some by brann  companys entrance at the end ill miss diana rigg as oleana tyrell i hope she will be back someday she and littlefinger are obviously partnersincrime "

"538" "Bluedylan" 2014-04-28 " i welcome that ambiguity absolutely but rape isnt ambiguous rough sex does not equal rape "

"540" "pipdog" 2014-04-28 " i think all the criticism of the rape scene misses the point that so much of got deals in ambiguity and peoples motives not always being easy to discern whos to say cersei isnt now using the situation to assert her power over jaime shes hardly a shrinking violet after all a bit of rough sex wouldnt distress her too much for too long methinks not when theres a tactical advantage to be gained from it "
"541" "HashRouge" 2014-04-28 " i dont understand why some people say it wasnt rape because of the nature of their relationship ive seen this quite a bit since the previous episode aired and im frankly gobsmacked in what world is it not rape if the woman repeatedly says no she clearly did not consent being in a twisted creepy incestuous relationship doesnt mean that she doesnt have a right to say no im actually concerned by the fact that people including the director could view that scene as anything other than rape "

"543" "candylilacs" 2014-04-28 " tommen was always a sweet boy and that may mean just much more easy than joffrey  which is why in the books  it was always mentioned how everyone liked him and hated joffrey i think also because tommen loved cuddling and love from his mother and anyone because his brother was satan personified and also tortured him and his sister "
"544" "MRONeill" 2014-04-28 " this is largely why i didnt comment last week  there is no good answer here yet another reason why i dont like what the director did  i dont see the point in any ambiguity absolutely no means no that is not up for debate as a woman i understand this completely however from the perspective of someone watching a fantasy series in which rape torture murdernot to mention dragons giants and skin changersrun rampant watching incestuous twins alternatively gropehitkisspush each other in front of the body of their dead sadistic son  with the added perspective of knowing how this scene happened in the books  i do not think it was rape the only other time i think weve seen cersei and jaime actually have sex was in the tower at winterfell before jaime pushed bran  cersei protested then as well theirs is a relationship that goes beyond dysfunctional  he lovesd her for reasons we cant really understand because shes pretty solidly vile  but his sole motivation in remaining alive and returning to kings landing was to return to cersei she loved him because he was the male reflection of what she views as her own perfection again its one of the many reasons why i think the director did a terrible job with that scene he couldve used even just one or two lines from the book  had it play out exactly the same way  and it wouldve been clear that this was just another fvckd up tryst between two fvckd up people "
"545" "candylilacs" 2014-04-28 " no id say tommen is more 12 more child than boy and in the books she did the same thing  always reading with him telling him stories and playing with him with kittens and puppies as for margaery playing 1920 i like natalie dormer but even i cant do better than 26 for her yes i know shes 32 in real life "
"546" "Bluedylan" 2014-04-28 " well my feeling is that you can only analyse and criticise what is on the screen authorial intent is no excuse i would say i realise that the book version is much more ambiguous but surely there can be no doubt that what we saw on screen was rape i do accept that these episodes were in the can some time ago and so the writersshowrunners didnt have the opportunity to respond to audience reaction i suppose what i am attacking is the spectacular lack of judgement from the people involved and for me the comments of the director and benioff and weiss during the week made the situation even worse how did nobody on that set or in the editing room or at hbo not point out that the final edit clearly depicts rape rather than the ambiguous situation that they claim that they were going for the reason i am making this comment now is that we could only know for certain that it was a terrible misjudgement when we viewed the subsequent episode to see whether it was addressed any further which it wasnt i love the show i think the showrunners have done a wonderful job adapting the material and even departing from grrms text in lots of interesting ways but this was an awful decision not only does it depict rape almost as an afterthought it also massively impacts the way many viewers will perceive jaime whether rightly or wrongly i cant help but feel that it was a kind of hbo sensationalised version of rape to show what they can get away with which seems massively irresponsible to me "

"556" "RedCat21" 2014-04-28 " can i just say this episode contained massive spoilers for us book readers the boot is on the other foot and i dont think i like it the producers shouldve warned us in advance we have been spoiled and trolled by dd i would like to formally complain to the relevant authorities and please sarah ban anyone who posts spoilers from the tv show enough is enough us book readers have suffered long enough "
"557" "Clariana" 2014-04-28 " i enjoyed it too questions were answered "
"558" "volkerelle" 2014-04-28 " then again game of thrones is just not cricket "
"559" "Liberecan" 2014-04-28 " interestingly jaime does seem to be getting better at fighting in the books its lannister headman ser ilyn payne training him back up jaime suggests hes improving and ser ilyn just laughs but i was wondering whether he isnt really improving and ser ilyn is just shit hot "
"560" "Katheartsboo" 2014-04-28 " honestly we can all pack up and go home now ser pounce has made it onto tv "
"561" "RasLob" 2014-04-28 " but being in captivity under the threat of death is pretty darn dramatic it was just so goddamn contrived that bran and his merry band should end up at crasters keep "
"562" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2014-04-28 " so we just move on from the whole rape thing then as if it didnt happen what a terrible error by the showrunners and director im really struggling to comprehend this criticism it seems clear both from comments made last week by the director of last weeks ep and by the content of this weeks episode that the sept scene was trying to remain faithful to canon  ie not rape i agree that the scene was badly put together and gave off entirely the wrong impression however to criticise this episode for moving on seems daft given that both episodes were likely cut at least several weeks ago and thus were completed long before they knew there would be any criticism "
"563" "OldhamA" 2014-04-28 " ive only just worked out who locke is meant to be "
"564" "RedCat21" 2014-04-28 " i thought margaery played it brilliantly with tommen it was just the right mixture of motherly and shy puppy love girlfriend she is good at what she does it was slightly creepy but its supposed to be everyone is ruthless in their own way "
"565" "elleesse" 2014-04-28 " i for one am sad to see the jaime brienne pairing broken up jaimes scene with cersei last week notwithstanding it appeared from briennes teary eyes and her lingering last look at him and his rather forlorn figure following a little down the road after her and pod that they both think theyll never see the other again and that it is goodbye forever "
"566" "capuccina90" 2014-04-28 " im not sure if anyone noticed thismentioned it in the comments already but i loved how brienne and jaimes moment of farewell was completely analogous to their parting back in season 3 when jaime was leaving harrenhal  yet with their roles reversed back then brienne in that ridiculous dress was dignified and said goodbye ser jaime while he teared up and left with barely a nod here he kept calm when he said goodbye brienne while she teared up and nodded in return both were clearly emotional though in both of those scenes  some amazing acting from nikolaj and gwendoline as always it was just brilliant to watch  while i preferred the previous episode to this one some scenes just left me gobsmacked  like the general deplorable behaviour of the nights watch mutineers and the scary baby ritual in the end olenna and her witty snappy comebacks will be greatly missed margaery  tommen  awkward the age difference between the actors is a whopping 15 years and you can definitely tell shes slightly older littlefinger is just too creepy  i would not want to be stuck in the hold of a ship with him i think sansa will benefit from their time together though she seems like shell finally take off the rosetinted glasses and start playing the game danys conquest was satisfying but itll be interesting to see how the showrunners handle her story from here on in as it is she looks like shes getting comfortable in slavers bay and has no intentions of going anywhere anytime soon looking forward to some arya  the hound action next week hopefully "
"567" "DiamondDag" 2014-04-28 " i erm hmmm ser pounce i think thats the only point of reference i have left they might as well tell me pod is hodors brother at this point "
"568" "elleesse" 2014-04-28 " no  although loved bod hate the title sequence and opening music of got always wander off to make tea wait for the kettle to boil stir in the tea bag slowly pour milk in put the milk away come back in and its still on longest dreariest running opening titles ever in my head anyway "
"569" "elleesse" 2014-04-28 " i i too wondered if trouble for dany in the future  that and her lack of mercy to the slaveowners while she is the head of a vast army of slaves herself "
"570" "Pygar" 2014-04-28 " you make up for it with the hodor earlier  have some recommends "
"571" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-28 " gentlemans bet that bran wargs into hodor and kicks some serious backside next week its not in the books i just think its too good an opportunity to miss "
"572" "christophelamniepie" 2014-04-28 " sorry if this has already been posted butjust rewatched the scene between olenna amp sansa at the purple wedding and is clear as day now its been pointed out by lord wandering of accentnbsp that olenna pulls a bit off the necklacecould have saved myself 2 weeks of speculation if id been paying attention or read the books "

"575" "Josh202" 2014-04-28 " the week i lost my smugness as a book reader genuinely intrigued "
"576" "elleesse" 2014-04-28 " thanks for the clarification so weird i remember now after a deep dredging of my memory that of course theon blabbed to roose bolton that the stark boys were alive in a previous episode but had completely forgotten that anyone was sent after them but sending someone to get them makes perfect sense sending locke in particular just ramps up the fear factor i guess finding john snuuuu en route is the icing on the cake for locke sarah reckons death for them at lockes hand really surely more valuable alive but im obviously not keeping up with the ins and outs of the politics in westeros ah poor pod i wouldnt want to see him having to use his certain talents and ending up in one of littlefingers brothels for instance he and brienne are slightly similar in that they are both loyal and honest and slightly innocent so the buddy journey as someone else mentioned might not be as engaging as the more odd couples but im curious to see how it goes nonetheless "
"577" "FourTwoThreeOne" 2014-04-28 " the triangle of jaimecerseibrienne is for me one of the most interesting aspects of the series as theyve made it jaime as ms hughes rightly points out wants so badly to be the sort of honest upright honorable knight he sees in brienne but cersei just as badly wants to be the unencumbered bold dangerous fighter she sees jaime to be brienne despite being a bit odd and totally out of place in this world is the only one of the 3 who maintains her dignity and is strong enough in herself to forge ahead such an interesting dynamic among the 3 with the kind of depth that most shows every show on tv at the moment cant even approach "
"578" "Aelfwine" 2014-04-28 " dany seizing meereen felt oddly anticlimactic though it was nice seeing more of grey worm and missandei and that last shot of dany on her pyramid with her targaryen banner draped over that harpy very intrigued by the bran  jon  locke story it was lovely seeing pod and brienne setting out littlefinger was creepy ditto margaery its done what theyve done with her  making her so much more politicallysavvy during s2  s3 then keeping out of her loop re joffrey and most importantly leave hodor alone dammit it was really upsetting to see actually "
"579" "SAchick" 2014-04-28 " you didnt think it was rape she said no more than once she resisted she said stop and yet he continued thats rape end of the nature of their relationship is irrelevantno means no it doesnt matter who it is ever "
"580" "Catch22" 2014-04-28 " he overheard jon telling sam that bran was the other side of the wall and possibly at crasters hence why when opportunity arose to go north of the wall to crasters he took it "

"591" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-28 " but being in captivity under the threat of death is pretty darn dramatic "
"592" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-28 " its been taken down now but hbo gave a massive spoiler to the series and even the book fans by identifying the white walker with the magic touch by name on their website briefly bad hbolast week we had dubious consent do we now have margery grooming tommen he seems quite delighted by it so i suppose it doesnt matteri too shall miss diana rigg she has been delightfully catty and suitably outrageous in word throughoutas for danyreckon ser barristan is beginning to wonder just how much like her ohso noble brother rheagar she really is after that little display i still say shes heading down the same route her other brother and father did if she ever says wake the dragon or burn them all run for the hills "
"593" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-28 " funny though i saw it more as a littleice age version of stonehenge "
"594" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-28 " all in all very enjoyable i was left scratching my head at the final scene and i dont know about anyone else but i wonder if were starting to see the beginnings of some plot lines and seeing some scenes that relate to things that havent even been referenced in the books yet although that scene didnt appear in the book we are told that crasters sons become the white walkers so it seems to me like a standard show dont tell change from print to screen "
"595" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-28 " and no i dont watch the series  no hbo here and didnt read the books but i read the summaries as a way of keeping tabs on what passes for entertainment among the great western multitudes these days just as with pikketys book  i read the accolades and marvel at the sanctimony capitalism in the 21st century and game of thrones  two sides of the same coin much worn you should probably either read the books or watch the show before passing judgment on why the rest of us find them entertaining "
"596" "Bluedylan" 2014-04-28 " so we just move on from the whole rape thing then as if it didnt happen what a terrible error by the showrunners and director thankfully nikolaj costerwaldau is such a charismatic presence that we can get back on board with jaimes broadly redemptive arc fascinating to see that theres a whitewalker hierarchy and theres method to their abject terror rather than just a generic evil force of nature as such also nice to see book readers second guessing for a change  the dany and bran stuff feels fairly uninspiring at this point for me just more of the same i want more of the red viper tyrion tywin and that crew i even prefer stannis to sacking slave cities over and over again and moping through snowy woods over and over also isnt dany a bit too zealous for anyone else she never listens to anyone ever and is completely consumed by her own certainty which is normally a rather dangerous trait in life "
"597" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-28 " and the other promo for clive owen as a victorian surgeon apparently thats a miniseries my guess is ten episodes that will air on cinemax and will be titled the knick its set in the early 1900s in the nowclosed knickerbocker hospital in manhattan "

"602" "HonestIago" 2014-04-28 " for once i thought an episode of game of thrones was going to leave me feeling happy then we went north i enjoyed the little scene between grey worm and missandei lovely bit of fleshing out and showing rather than telling what danys army is fighting for the dragon flag over the great pyramid of meereen gave me the good kind of chills too i liked virtually all of the kings landing stuff the kingslayer brothers and their loyalty to each other providing a rare bit of normality in that family olenna giving her final lesson to margaery and margaery acting on it still not sure the tyrells are to be trusted but when you compare them to the lannisters their scheming seems far more benign i loved how olenna didnt flinch when telling how she murdered joffrey the jamiebriennepod scenes were just wonderful i just wish they hadnt gone down the route of brienne loving jamie it was a fitting break to one of the most consistently interesting pairings though then we went north and i lost the will to live "
"603" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-28 " in this last episode you see jon snow mad at sam who couldnt stop bran going north remember sam met bran and cie on the other side of the wall "

"607" "HonestIago" 2014-04-28 " im still annoyed last week didnt involve liver and onions i wouldnt count coldhands out yet though they may have just rejigged the timeline like they did with the reeds i know in s2 i was worried they werent going to show "

"611" "HonestIago" 2014-04-28 " as you say hes got varys and olenna who know who he truly is i doubt varys is idle in his absence and olenna took the information and used it id bet tyrion has a good idea who littlefinger truly is but that might not matter after the trial "
"612" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2014-04-28 " youre a real ray of sunshine nowt so boring as someone who just has to kick against anything popular "
"613" "Sammed" 2014-04-28 " thats why a lot of bookreaders are concerned about the rapid aging of tommen he is supposed to be prepubescent whereas margaery still has her maidenhead she ends up marrying a prepubescent boy pedophile which i guess is too creepy for tv audiences so a little creative licensing isnt that bad in this regard "
"614" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2014-04-28 " sam tarly has told jon that he saw bran at the nightfort it was referenced in this episode in the scene in the scroll room  library "

"617" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2014-04-28 " ive seen some other reviews mildly critical of this episode but i thought it was a very welcome change of pace for the series the farewell scene between jaime and brienne was wonderful the look of understanding when brienne announces the name of her new sword was great at least jaime can console himself with the fact that someone gets why he became the kingslayer i also found grey worm and missandeis scene quite affecting nice to get some interplay between the staff in danys coterie i wonder however whether grey worms stuff about kill the masters may spell trouble in the future for dany all in all very enjoyable i was left scratching my head at the final scene and i dont know about anyone else but i wonder if were starting to see the beginnings of some plot lines and seeing some scenes that relate to things that havent even been referenced in the books yet "

"621" "HonestIago" 2014-04-28 " i cant stand zombie shit and magic crap so theyhe could have left the whitewalkers out altogether afaic to be fair the series is called a song of ice and fire if you dont want the ice zombies and dragons you might as well just read a history of the plantagenetswars of the roses i liked the contrast a targaryenruled city under a banner of fire and blood at the start and the white walkers lair a citadel of ice at the end that was nicely done "

"625" "merlin2" 2014-04-28 " the most interesting thing about the game of thrones are the humans enthralled by it the rest sounds like a typical knightsinarmor soap opera with opportunities for wallowing in violence and mayhem perhaps the popularity of the show like that of various vampire zombie and breaking bad drug cult shows indicates a collective anticipation of humanitys fate and perhaps a process of psychological apreparation for the dehumanization sure to follow not too long for nw game of thrones seems to be modern entertainment equivalent of the gladiator shows mounted by rome for the pleasure of watching citizenry perhaps when it comes down to it humans have evolved only in so far as moving the blood and gore to the screen from real life they still enjoy it just a bit more vicariously and no i dont watch the series  no hbo here and didnt read the books but i read the summaries as a way of keeping tabs on what passes for entertainment among the great western multitudes these days just as with pikketys book  i read the accolades and marvel at the sanctimony capitalism in the 21st century and game of thrones  two sides of the same coin much worn "

"637" "cybersuperhero" 2014-04-28 " indeed in fact perhaps the best of the series so far i was surprised as well about the deviation from the books but i think given how much of the book theyve already used up they needed to branch out a bit more and moreover im intrigued to see how this situation resolves itself also a great performance from diana rigg whose character has easily the sharpest tongue in westeros "
"638" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-28 " oh i thought he was there because they think thats where bran and co will head and hes to try and stop them reaching jon and make sure they stay dead this time and possibly get rid of jon as well "

"649" "Phillyguy" 2014-04-28 " well in arranged marriages i guess a lot of it is fake she specifically says they should get to know each other  not that shes been mooning for him since he hit puberty she will almost certainly bend him around her finger if only because she would bend most men around her finger "

"672" "MRONeill" 2014-04-28 " i loved this episode for many reasons but largely because of how much it deviated from the books yes this made it surprising for books readers but more importantly moved the plot lines along very nicely and opened up a whole realm of future possibilities in particular two of the most often complained about plot lines  dany and bran  moved forward well dany showed a bit of the targaryen madness in thinking justice was killing 163 masters and not recognizing the wisdom of mercy the grey worm scenes were great although if hes crushing on missandi im not sure how far that can proceed the only thing i think that isnt debatable from last week is that the director did a horrendous job of portraying the cerseijamie scene has he apparently intended while i didnt think it was rape because of the nature of their relationship it disturbed me not only for its content but as others said of the confusion it placed over jaimes character this weeks many scenes with jaime only clarified what we all shouldve known  all characters are flawed and no one is wholly good or evil bronn giving jaime a lesson in morality are you going to visit your brother the touching and honest scene between jaime and tyrion jaime sharing his page of the kings guard book with brienne akin to a teenage boy sharing his most shameful journal entry with his girlfriend and certainly bequeathing oathkeeper and the task to find and save sansa on her for the purpose of saving sansa or adding something to his kings guard entry that counterbalances kingslayer to entirely defying cersei not only will he not kill his brother hell do what he can to save sansa  jaime is perhaps more complex than other characters but certainly not any better or worse than anyone else smaller points  as others have said the grin on pods face was priceless  hes grown into quite the handsome fellow the fear and disgust on sweet tommens face when looking at jofferys bow through the boars head was a nice reminder of how glad we all should be that hes dead i liked the apparent albeit relative innocence that margery didnt even suspect olenna in the murder of joffery  and even if potentially creepy ill take her seduction of tommen over his mothers influence any day looking forward to the return of the notsostable lady lysa surely a lysa and littlefinger marriage is one of the grosser relationships we can imagine and as sarah pointed out the baby didnt seem entirely disturbed by the white walkersit was an intriguing and new viewpoint of these creaturesgodsconsidering what they couldve done to the baby perhaps turning it into one of their own if that is what happened isnt the worst thing possible "

"697" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-28 " this episode was tight as a drum with a lot of ground covered to set up what should be some interesting arcs over the next couple of weeks jamie is becoming one of the most intriguing if not likeable characters on the show his rapport with tyrion is excellent while his relationship with cersei is now completely fallen apart that will be all lord commander pod and brienne seem like an honourable if somewhat vanilla pairing the best duos in the show tend to be a combination of sinner and saint like jamiebrienne or aryahound speaking of sweetsour combinations they dont come much further apart than sansa and littlefinger so it will be interesting to see that dynamic develop particularly as sansa seems to be finally willing to take some risks interesting to see whether she becomes his protege or his prize he may corrupt her or redeem himself in some way out of loyalty to her mother littlefinger confirmed what we already knewsuspected namely that he was the one who set up joffreys death and that hes playing the lannisters at a larger game theywe dont see he has confirmed his intention to marry sansas aunt lysa so how sansa fits into his plans is as yet unclear in an episode that heavily featured events at or north of the wall it seemed somewhat muddled in season 3 bran swore sam to secrecy to prevent him from telling jon he was nearby and now hes going looking for him and his wolf are the brothers destined for a reunion seems oddly fortuitous for bran to fall into tanners lap and give him a valuable hostage just as his bigger brother is about to come calling it also seems somewhat odd for the mutineers to have kept jons wolf alive for apparently no good reason at all jon has problems of his own though slynt and thorne want him out of the picture and the scarfaced new recruit that hes befriended is as cold a killer as the one hes riding out to face down thorne has taken a huge gamble though if jon returns victorious he will be a hero and it will be impossible to stop him from emerging as a natural leader tanner claims not to have lost a fight since he was 9 years old i suspect that record is about to change and i also reckon locke will be the one to do it there will also be not 1 but 2 direwolves on the premises when it goes down so all bets will be off at that point "

"718" "dsk84" 2014-04-28 " wow really enjoyed this weeks episode  not that i normally dont but for once everything seemed to have a purpose and generally worked the scene between grey worm and missandai was touching though i was left with the feeling that his englishwesterosiwhatever he was meant to be speaking in was worse in that scene than it had ever been or maybe i hadnt heard enough of him speak completely agree with barristans advise to dany though there is a time and place to take certain actions and hers certainly seemed misguided to say the least the littlefinger scene followed by lady olenna has brilliantly done both nicely played off by a younger character slowly piecing together the others plot i do want to know if the targeryan olenna was talking about was the mad king or not certainly dodged a bullet if that was the case not sure what caused a bigger smile  the appearance of ser pounce or pods eagerness to serve brienne  i was grinning like an idiot during both scenes on the other hand the whole scene at crasters keep and the baby sacrifice on a whole was by far the most uncomfortable i have felt watching got all very well done but the actual rape followed by the baby being taken to the woods was pretty wrenching jon snow really doesnt know what sort of situation hes gotten himself into with thorneslynt then the unpleasant bunch at crasters and locke and whoever else he has with him in his party this goes well beyond a rock and a hard place finally i will say i was pleasantly surprised by how they are taking brans story like most people i find it the weakest part in the books so to see them taking in an unexpected way that is arguably more interesting will make for good viewing i will no longer dread his scenes "

"735" "ChaeImpi" 2014-04-28 " i agree sarah it was a well paced episode i just worry that the more fantastical if it is not a real word im making it one elements of the books dont translate well on the small screen whether its due to budget constraints dragons and direwolves dont have as much presence on screen as they should or the fact that the cgi versions of the whitewalkers arent nearly as mysterious and frightning as the whispers and tales of them are it all lessens the excitement and drama and foreboding these magical elements bring to the story as a whole for this same reason the series have never really been able to do danys story justice how does everyone else feel "
