"44" "Cosmonaut" 2013-06-14 " scandibaby  do you really think there were no psychopaths in the past of course not but its nonsensical to imprint current behaviour classifications on historical events or fiction heavily based on historical events as is got a case in point  killing prisoners after a battle this is clearly beyond the pale now but historically it was not considered to be the crime that it now is given that in many instances it was an issue arising from lack of resources one of the kindest acts with regards to prisoners relatively speaking in history is what the byzantines did after battles in the balkans  they would fully blind every 99 prisoners and the hundredth would be blinded in one eye so he could lead the others home its easy  and intellectually lazy  to class this as the orders of a psychopath but really it isnt anything of the sort "

"97" "5432Hun" 2013-06-13 " dsm3  its difficult to discuss without spoilers to be honest but speaking generally and with reference only to events seen so far what stops it being just a liberal fantasy is consequences like in s1 when danys attempts to civilise drogo and save the women from being raped backfire so spectacularly drogo dies his khalaser fragments and the women are raped and murdered anyway this last consequence was underplayed on tv so rather than being read as merely a liberal fantasy you could equally read it as a cautionary allegory on the consequences of white european intervention when you get down to it its a complicated picture i dont want to let grrmthe writers completely off the hook whether subconscious or otherwise there are obvious white mans burden overtones in danys story line and like many i was uncomfortable with the imagery of the final scene of s3 but grrm is pretty good at subverting fantasygenre conventions by for example cutting the head off his protagonist in the first book so i thinks its more than just whitegirlsavestheethnics "

"296" "ACertainBang" 2013-06-12 " this series is spectacular unique and well worth the 3 season wait but there are some elements which are problematic sometimes these things resolve themselves in retrospect or with a bit of helpful context from a bookreader and sometimes the writers fix things for the new season so here goes watching some characters moving endlessly around the countryside ending up somewhere after ten episodes that isnt far from where they started without accomplishing much isnt satisfying these meandering journeys can be made to work see jaime and arya so the writers need to pay attention to those which are not bran in particular and add some interest along the way that was a beautiful cinematic shot of little miss messiah at the end there but the last two episodes worth of dany stuff havent helped reinforce that she deserves this adulation in fact her impatience how long does sacking a city take and the lame offscreen barely logical surrender of yunkai have really undermined any feeling that she earned this reverence previous very traumatic childhood notwithstanding even though the white walkers are meant to be something the ignorant and arrogant power players dont take seriously the audience needs to feel the threat not showing the battle at the fist was a mistake and sidelining them since has been too they dont feel scary and unstoppable right now and they need to come across that way to crank up the dramatic tension same goes for the wilding army that said they are nailing every scene in kings landing small council meetings are always a delight i especially like the way tywin showed respect to tyrion in their postmeeting conversation im guessing because tyrion stood up to joffrey whilst still not failing to put him in his place with the almost drowning reminiscence dragonstone scenes are also undeniably perfect these arent fatal flaws and there are budget constraints but i think it would be even more brilliant if they could iron out some of this next year regardless im really looking forward tojoffreys wedding wedding are guaranteed squirmfests in westerosbrans arctic voodoodanys dragons growth spurtteam stannisarya tackling her todo listlannister infightingcerseis bedding ceremony "

"330" "Greenseer" 2013-06-11 " late to the party this time  i was away from the computer last night and ive had a couple of rewatches others have dealt with the major set pieces so i wont repeat them what stood out for me in this final episode was that after all the comments on here for the last 10 weeks about women being objectified and powerless etc we had a definite theme of our girls the title was mhysa but even the women who were not mothers stood out last night yaras decision to defy her father and sail to the dreadfort to rescue her brother aryas first real attack of studied vengeance danys wrestling with responsibility over power cerseis determination not to accept her coming marriage and poor sansa  making the best of her marriage and sharing banter with tyrion only to have it all snatched away again one step forward and ten back hang on in there sansa i still have great hopes for you lets not forget ygritte  a moving performance from rose leslie struggling with her conflicted love for jon whilst shae refused varys offer of a way out just so she could cling to her own love for both tyrion and sansa and even gilly our third mother of the episode showed her gratitude for sams help in getting her away from craster and saving her sons life by naming the baby after him some cynical viewers may have seen that as cheesy or sentimental  im of that age where these little moments mean a lot to me in the violent and powercrazed world of westeros the final episodes of all the seasons so far have never been climactic as such but they have tied up the character arcs for the year and put the players into the positions they will need to be for the next stage of their journeys it is a difficult thing for dd to do given that the character canvas has grown enormously since season 1 but i think they managed it even if some scenes did seem a wee bit rushed and dragonstone as always was magnificent if anyone still remains unconvinced about dillane then they dont deserve him his intense scenes with liam cunningham this season have been among the best imho there was an early scene with mel and davos perhaps episode 2 or 3 where he had only one or two lines of dialogue and still managed to command the scene i havent any complaints really  unless it was the cgi for that hillside ruin where bran and co were headed dare we bookies name it the night fort  dont think thats a spoiler is it april yet a lack of sarahs blog and the posters entertaining and thoughtful comments here every week will be a big hole in my online life "

"586" "angelamarica" 2013-06-11 " cheshirekaz  with the colonialracist implications i would say that the dothraki were dark skinned nomadic warriors and slavers deeply feared on essos and placated by the free cities was drogo any more brutal than gregor clegane or many of the knights depicted in the tv series the more random nature of danys origins and the geographical variety of essos does not come over as well as in the books indeed danys family were conquerors of westeros from the east valyria 300 years before these events dany may have some westerosi blood but it seems to me the larger part of her genetic makeup is valyrian a region to the west of the slave cities another hint is that in the books white blond hair and purple eyes are a dead give away that she is the blood of the dragon kings who married mainly their sisters and cousins to keep the line pure id say she has similar connotations to the elves in lord of the rings ie not quite your run of the mill homosapiens apart from the golden haired lannisters the white blonde hair of the bleach bottle does not appear to crop up much plus there are her dragon raising abilities i do feel in the series visually it does look like the great white queen subduing the darker skinned people due to the oversimplified story arc the books however are at pains to point out some of the superior civilisation buildings and materials that they have in the east compared to the fairly primitive medievalism of westeros dont forget she is aiming to conquer westeros again as well  i fear she may well be disappointed with the grim grey and cold weather and lack of culture and wish she was back on her holidays once she gets the throne will she want it  will she rule both essos and westeros and in some way unify them despite the westerosis alleged aversion to slavery it seems to me that in this deeply feudal system small folk and soldiers are little better than slaves they seem to be given food and keep for service not actual wages even the whores are enslaved unless they manage to steal or snare a rich patron the high born are stutified by convention and abuse of power and wealth this may be a hint that westeros is deeply feudal and racist and discriminatory and sexist and dany is planning to change all that i think there is a strong hint of the new z generation coming up for power and turning everything around in other words the whole world is in a complete mess but there is some light at the end of the tunnel "

"939" "miapatrick" 2013-06-10 " dellou  i see what you are saying ive had similar thoughts myself but where dany is she is the outsider with white skin it is a hotter country westeros is prone to long cold winters and even in summer isnt as hot as there the people in that particular country have darker skin because in hotter countries people develop darker skin her paleness emphasises her dragon status she doesnt burn though in which case i would have liked to have seen some redness and blistering on her brothers skin its worth remembering that not all the dark skinned people are slaves many are slave owners and i think this is why there is the emphasis on her not buying slaves but liberating them from darkskinned owners when europeans and americans bought slaves from west africa they were participating in an indigenous system but at that point one evil thing slave owning was joined to another evil thing racism and the result was horrific when you have one distinct ethnic group owning slaves who belong to another distinct ethnic group you move from the idea you are inferior because you are a slave to the idea you are a slave because you are inferior the former being there in ancient roman society for example the latter in european colonial and american history dany sidesteps this by freeing them automatically which is probably due to her own history married off on her brothers order who basically sold her no literally sold her to her husband "

"979" "miapatrick" 2013-06-10 " edroyle  the jamie part is fascinating because while we see this we also see the boy he pushed from the tower to hide his relationship with his sister on his own quest so for all jamie is increasingly appearing as fundamentally under it all decent which was indicated even before he tried to kill the stark boy by his seemingly affectionate relationship with tyrion he has tried to kill a child had an incestuous relationship with his twin sister acceptable to some highborn families but not from comments made the lannisters and been instrumental in putting his natural born son on the throne as basically usurper interestingly what really pricks at his conscience isnt any of this but killing a sadistic psychopath which interestingly leads into the story about the cook cursed by the goods not for killing or for tricking someone into familial cannibalism but for killing a guest vows matter more than morals or tie into morality more than being good as for arya part of me cheered he had it coming doing that to the body of her brother and her own direwolfs sibling which would have been a kind of sibling to her as well he had it coming part of me realises it should be mourned the tainting of her childhood but that was done when people started killing her family part of me wonders at some point could sansa end up on her list given that she was foolishly responsible for the death of their father and a lot that came after and given the conversation between sansa an tyrion about such lists "

"984" "Woof73" 2013-06-10 " right i have made a hole in my schedule no bedtime story for me tonight and so lets try this again it all started with that conversation with davos in the dungeon i kept thinking back to it without really knowing why at first i thought that it was because i missed him but that wasnt it he was as insolent and obstinate as usual but then during my monthly haircut thanks to lady sarah for noticing it hit me and the rest was actually quite easy it played out just as it did in the cell i presented davos with the facts  that it was a question of whether the life of one boy is worth that of ten thousand men  and he answered as he had before of course i sympathised but i had a part to play so i told him what i planned to do the rest was simply a question of letting davos be davos oh come now dont act all surprised do you really think i didnt know hed free the boy at the first opportunity did you think that even the kings hand can just smuggle prisoners out of the royal dungeons at dusk without anyone noticing i know it looks like theres just a few of us knocking around the castle but thats down to budget issues more than anything and since i snapped out of my reverie ive been paying attention you saw me catch davos in that lie about how he learned to read didnt you stands to reason that i knew about the threat from the north before he did the problem for kings is that they sometimes survive their mistakes misjudging the imp at blackwater that was one of mine and my men deserted me in droves pinning my flag to melisandres dark magic is another and one far harder and more dangerous to extricate myself from but thats why i keep davos around the walder frey to my tywin lannister although clearly for very different reasons he does those things that a king cannot i cannot be seen to be indecisive i cannot be seen to favour the life of one lowborn bastard against the lives of my own bannermen i may want to blunder in all honourable and shiny like robb stark but look where that got him no i had to be more circumspect so i played the two against and for each other with me the implacable immovable king in the middle still need more convincing it took me what half a minute to completely change the direction of my campaign did i seem as worried as the red woman at the news did i demand more proof further divination or suspect a trap no i made a joke i  stannis baratheon  made a joke do i have to hold up a sign before you understand the two of them left each thinking they still held sway over me good ill need the pair of them working together if were to survive this better still ive done the right thing  and no one will ever know played for and got and that is why im the one true king i am invigorated ive decided to take a more active role next season show that uptight tywin lannister a thing or two about power and heroics brace yourselves my loyal subjects  shifts about to get real from despatches  telling your armed girlfriend what shes thinking ahd how she feels you really do know nothing jon snow shae really is being a bit crap at the moment its one thing to be in an awkward social situation but im not really buying her turn from worldlywise hooker to petulant ahole what is this pretty woman say what you like about the hound hes going to make an excellent dad some idle talk in the jousting square about davos being the most honourable man in the kingdom must be a different davos the only one i know is a former pirate who just disobeyed a direct order from his king tyrion is up there though when hes sober and it was kind of sweet to see varys acknowledge that some men just want to watch the world burn others settle down spawn a sociopathic bastard get established and then start the fire that roose bolton is creepy as hell and seemingly without motivation right thats it from me for another 40 weeks or so unless the guardian feels like paying me to do this for a living hahaha two jokes in one night i am in a good mood thanks again to everyone ill see you all next year stannis baratheon "

"1058" "rickylee369" 2013-06-10 " after the disturbing developments of last weeks red wedding i was quite literally dancing as the string laden theme announced the final instalment of this seasons got i was not disappointed well a little i was expecting retribution on a grand scale what i got instead was the punch drunk chanting of here comes the king of the north and a beheaded corpse mockingly crowned with direwolf snout so not a shift start and yes i meant shift cheers sanza news of freys godbaiting you get turned into a rat that devours your young if you kill a guest under your roof apparently treachery reached kings landing by raven in record time denying sanza and tyrion any real chance of their seeming affection for each other becoming something more substantial shame still we dont watch game of thrones for easy going romantic comedy do we one of the reasons we do watch was evident in the meeting of the small council joffreys childlike giddiness at the news of robb starks demise turning on a pinhead to brutal savagery at his insistence that he will serve his head to sanza at his own wedding petulance disobedience and ignoble humiliation follow in the space of three minutes his leftfield performance only bettered by the subtlety of dinklage and the cruel authority of dance fantastic work all three fellas the knowledge that daddy considered drowning you at birth must not have been such a shock in such feudal times but to hear the words thrown at you in accusation would obviously hurt tyrions empathy for sanzas loss of her family is surely more heartfelt with the knowledge that her family were honourable and loving whereas his own is cold calculating and seemingly better off had he never been born from this comes i think the most likeable character in the show so far i would also like to point out that many of the stark men are now dead so it wasnt really a case of killing twelve at dinner rather than 10000 in battle though i look forward to finding out who will get blackfishs allegiance now it is not to hard to imagine that hes going to want revenge against roose the new warden of the north i quiver in anticipation new eunuch theons reeks rescue from his nowknown tormentor seems imminent now that the iron born are on the way in fact much has been nicely set up for the start of the next season natural alliances are forming and people are moving forward nicely in their quests whether it is sam meeting bran and ending up with john snow in his arms literally struck by cupids arrows or gendrys move into a lonely abyss of a sea aryas first kill or jaime and his twin finally reunited there is much to look forward to much has been written already about dany and the quasireligious worship an aryan woman is getting from the natives it has been taken as a nod to white imperialism and that point may be valid for my part i would suggest that she is giving people their freedom not forcing them to fight but simply showing she has powerful allies and should they wish they can all go get themselves some power or they can go their own way and be free to find their own path i dont see anything wrong with that but i am not that bright i dont watch the show to confront ethics and political correctness i get enough of that in real life thanks so all in all another great season there is much still to see including many as yet unseen characters as those people who annoyingly refer to the bloody books in their posts will tell you i will enjoy that symphony after ive watched the rock concert as for having to wait another year for the next episode theres really no needi am not tired "

"1132" "Cosmonaut" 2013-06-10 " dryhtscipe  all valid points on a wider note theres a conflict between how providers want to provide and how consumers want to consume a great case in point is someone like netflix or lovefilm  they simply dont want to offer a payasyougo service as theres more money in having people use their service for a bit get bored with it and then forget to cancel it maybe the future is an end to restaurants with menus leaving only buffet restaurants as far as the eye can see "
"1133" "Werthead" 2013-06-10 " sharon gordon  book 3 has been split over two seasons the first twothirds of the book are in season 3 and the last third will be in season 4 along with some bits from the start of books 4 and 5 which take place simultaneously in timeline terms the final scene from book 3 is way off it should land somewhere around halfway through season 4 assuming theyre maintaining the book timeline there is actually an alternative scene they could have used from the book which does something similar and is chronologically in the right place but its a mystical dream sequence from a character not previously established on tv as having prophetic dreams so might have been difficult to have achieved they could have done the same scene and dropped the dream angle though "
"1134" "Fulton" 2013-06-10 " ashamanic  yeah i thought the jon and ygritte scene was rather obviously stitched on to give that storyline a wrap shes managed to catch up with his horse tracking crosscountry sneak up on him and she hasnt brought any other wildlings with her doesnt scan "

"1140" "Thaizinred" 2013-06-10 " diamonddag  i still dont get the point of the name change there are other pairs of characters with really similar names that werent considered too confusing for exapmle you have a aegon and aemon bran and bron joer and jorah robert robb and robert hoster and howland people can tell them apart since they dont often or at all share screenpage time and are played by different people why were two women who probably wont ever share screen time and look nothing alike too confusing "

"1143" "Ashamanic" 2013-06-10 " overall a pretty poor episode i thought much of just didnt feel true and seeing ygritte abandon all the other wildlings to track down jon who apparently wasnt paying attention behind him to see if he was being followed was just ludicrous "
"1144" "jennifera30" 2013-06-10 " oh wait did the letter to balon say that the ironborn who turned against theon at winterfell had also been flayed im not somewhere that i can rewatch and i need to know that finchy got what was coming to him "

"1149" "OldhamA" 2013-06-10 " diamonddag  i think the white liberator thing is there if you want to see it personally i dont but some people are incredibly sensitive and look for faultinsult around every corner and under every rock "

"1159" "OldhamA" 2013-06-10 " sarahhughes  the most amazing dany moment was when she stepped out of the bath but maybe thats just me "
"1160" "SharpMango" 2013-06-10 " jimmymac  the white walkers hardly seem scary though they walk really slowly scream for no reason and no offence to sam are really really bad at capturing unfit soldiers i mean come on at the end of s02 a white walker who looked exactly like what youd imagine a 200 year old man trying to get on a horse would look like he roared at sam and then let him run offwhats so scary about them theyre just a bunch of old frozen people up north "
"1161" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2013-06-10 " guardiansek  1 1015 pounds not sure three dragonglass knives and two arrowheads weight that much i have to say i enjoyed that interlude personally 2 danys storyline really seemed to pick up this series beyond her moaqning about my dragons but this last episode was disappointing i was like others commenting on this blog a bit queasy about the white blond liberator thing its odd as it hadnt really crossed my mind reading the books but seeing it on screen brought it home a bit 3 tywins characterisation and performance by charles dance is proabbly the best thing in the show for me 4 not sure what to say here for fear of being modded however it was nice to resurrect the braavosi coin to signal developments for next series he disarming of the hound shows her nascent skill in all things pointyendy 5 i view davos as a counterpoint to ned stark in many ways poor ned believed in the honour of everyone along with his own davos believes only in the honour of stannis not anyone else 6 it was a good scene although the small council scene topped it for me it points to a bit of an acceleration visavis the books though so it will be interesting how things develop "
"1162" "OldhamA" 2013-06-10 " dhulmes  the dany storyline seems like its taking place in a different world not just the obvious difference in the climate but shes a liberating hero everyone else in gots is a murderous back stabbing callous bastard "
"1163" "EnglishDisco" 2013-06-10 " benjyuk  i understand why people might think it an anticlimax  but i found it quite poetic in an episode titled mhysa we spent more time with the prominent fathers of westeros and their tough love tywins resentment of tyrion balons detachment to theon  roose boltons tough lessons and misplaced pride with ramsey this only higlighted the absence of mothers in my eyes it makes you winder how some of these children would have grown up if their mother was alive the only mothers we get close to throughout the series are cersei and catalyn  both of whom make questionable decisions as far as their children are concerned this is nicely juxtaposed with dany after having lost a child  becomes the mother of dragons and now inspires a cult following through the former slave cities "
"1164" "SharpMango" 2013-06-10 " dickvandyke  maybe because of my heritage but i wasnt a big fan of the brown people basically worshipping the blonde haired woman who freed them with some rather atavistic chanting dany is my favourite storyline but i just didnt like the undertones got normally never gives off these orientalist vibes except that minor discussion in s1e1 when people tried to figure out if the dothraki portrayal was racist in retrospect it wasnt in the pilot episode though perhaps the pov was portraying them as a very different people to the westerosi "
"1165" "BeheadtheRoyals" 2013-06-10 " agree and following the line of your comments to the events to possibly come for dany on the telly next season is a spoiler alert i wonder if the producers are going to keep splitting the books in halves or thirds we would be facing more than seven seasons "
"1166" "jimmy_mac" 2013-06-10 " i havent read the books and dont want to get into possible spoiler discussion but is dragonglass made by dragons breathing fire on stone or sand or something if so dragons may presumably play a role in defeating the white walkers "

"1173" "DanTheMan4815" 2013-06-10 " guardiansek  yeah i know of all of those characters the point i was rather haphazardly trying to make is that davos is one of the only seemingly good characters on the show who i would describe as a main character and i find it interesting that he is one of the only main characters who is lowborn by good character i mean he hasnt yet shown any kind of selfish motivation or actions yet im not sure what i mean by main really ha i would love to see more of gendry hopefully with arya i always quite liked the idea of those two being thrust together as a not so subtle allusion to ned and roberts friendship "

"1177" "guardiansek" 2013-06-10 " very good episode maybe the best of the season though episodes 4  5 were also really good last weeks episode was rather numbing and i will miss robb and catelyn my usual thoughts1 didnt like sam meeting bran  co one i suspect that sam will tell jon that he has seen bran also sam carried 1015 pounds of obsidian weapons back from the fist of the first men small but annoying incongruities there 2 congratulations on the adulation danaerius now dont get sidetracked on on some abolitionist crusade that has nothing to do with the iron throne and will earn you many powerful enemies in essos slave culture got now has a wellestablished tendency to kill off characters who lose sight on what it takes to gain and hold power id hate to see you added to a list that looks like ned died for honor robb died for love and dany died for freedom 3 does westeros have a father of the year award i hope so because its the one thing that tywin i almost threw you into the sea when you were born but i thought twice and raised you as my despised child lannister is not going to win great scene though 4 good scene with arya though rather heavyhanded telegraphing of a kill bill storyline to come maybe thats kill bolton instead 5 ser davos is a fun character but you have to wonder if his morality is going to doom him and ultimately stannis again in westeros being hesitant to do what needs to be done to gain power gets you killed also the sudden ok lets go north and spare ser davos didnt really wash with me we needed more meat behind melisandres conversion to that cause and her speaking up for davos 6 probably my favorite scene is yara going on her rescue mission to save her brother i remember her tender scene from last season where she warned theon to abandon winterfell for his own good but he refused "

"1218" "Cosmonaut" 2013-06-10 " sarah thank you for the blog this season  its been entertaining amusing and thoughtprovoking thanks for putting up with those of us whove not read the books and have been asking questions that must have made it very tempting for you to dripfeed future events  and thanks to you and the team for prompt removal of spoilers whether written by the wellintentioned or the trolls theres only two questions remaining a how long do we have to wait until the fourth seriesb will you be blogging again with your technoheath robinsonesque setup of computers and slingbox "
"1219" "EnglishDisco" 2013-06-10 " what an excellent season true enough to the books but brilliant in its own right my only criticism is they spent too much time with theon in a show with as many viewpoint characters as this every minute is important  and i think a few too many minutes were wasted watching theon being tortured they could have done that in one episode  but i have a a feeling they wanted more screen time for alfie allen "
"1220" "Halgonian" 2013-06-10 " sarahhughes  yes thank you sarah turning to your blog has been the first thing i do on monday morning before even my first cup of tea "
"1221" "jimmy_mac" 2013-06-10 " i agree with you sarah sir davos is quickly becoming my favorite character as well he preaches truth to power without a thought to the potential negative consequences to himself i also agree that the plot  as evidenced in part by davoss exhortations regarding the threat from beyond the wall  is beginning to turn from a struggle between various houses for control to a fight for survival between men and monsters and perhaps between the forces of a magical religion against the power of otherworldly evil  the lord of light and dragons vs the white walkers and wights "
"1222" "hazh" 2013-06-10 " sarahhughes  as i see it is that there are major problems with book 4 and 5 theyd make boring seasons i think so instead of having half of book 3 next season it would have been better to merge part of book 3 with most of 4 therefore they should have at least one major event this episode and leave the rest to the next season somehow i was more annoyed with jaime returning to kings landing so soon its out of sequence and somehow felt very jarring "
"1223" "DeleteThisPost" 2013-06-10 " dsk84 10 june 2013 156pm i was also thinking that taking off in that boat is a pretty risky thing to do even if you know how to row and know how to swim considering the waters in that area but of course possibly dying by drowning is preferable than certainly dying by exsanguination "
"1224" "dsk84" 2013-06-10 " diamonddag  in which case his father almost certainly ended the war by killing the king "
"1225" "dickvandyke" 2013-06-10 " diamonddag  i think they changed it because in the book theres a lot of stuff that happens with sam before he reaches the wall that you dont read about trying not to give anything away it would have meant a very long scene with sam explaining everything to bran and probably wouldnt have worked as well on tv "
"1226" "DiamondDag" 2013-06-10 " ntofr1  now that we can talk about it more openly i have to say im not overly fond of iwan rheons performance all jokes and mocking tones not a lot of menace i know hes doing awful things without a hint of remorse but its all a bit mischievous and playful dare i say i was hoping for something a bit more twisted and psychotic mood swings a nice counter to his dads coldness also your point about arya is why she is such a great character she manages to hold your sympathy even through the dark stuff ill give her a pass on stabbing random freys after what she saw them do to robb but yeah she isnt an innocent any more "
"1227" "SarahHughes" 2013-06-10 " backfromtokyo  oh i like that as an explanation good call "
"1228" "ntofr1" 2013-06-10 " oh and poor sansa i loved the first scene where she joked with tyrion about punishing those who laughed at them they looked like they could almost bear a life together even a plutonic one "
"1229" "Anotherplanet" 2013-06-10 " was it bill bailey who made a country boy comment to jaime as he walked through the gates at kings landing or just someone with a strange look and a similar accent "
"1230" "ntofr1" 2013-06-10 " allengza  aw jofs getting sleepy "
"1231" "ntofr1" 2013-06-10 " sarahhughes  and boy did boltons evil flourish if we all think the lannisters are westeros most dysfunctional family i wonder what dinner round the dreadfort is like when everyone is home im really looking forward to seeing roose and ramsay together at some point "
"1232" "BenjyUK" 2013-06-10 " allengza  tywins put that of him here was so good and so final that i had to wonder whether joffrey realised that this was the one person who had any real power or control over him "
"1233" "DiamondDag" 2013-06-10 " allengza  my father killed prince rhaegar sorry lad but your father is your own uncle "
"1234" "Cosmonaut" 2013-06-10 " so it turns out sam actually had more than one dragonglass dagger thank fk for that and he met the dream team too i always like it when different story threads come together return to form for the daenerys bit at the end of the episodeseries ie boring boring boring joffrey nicely put in his place ho ho ho best bit of the episode hodoring loudly into an echo chamber hodor "
"1235" "ntofr1" 2013-06-10 " diamonddag  the hound for king "
"1236" "SarahHughes" 2013-06-10 " ntofr1  the scene with jaime and cersei was brilliant and all without anything being said both actors were perfect agreed re ramsay finally but actually it did make sense as boltons evil needed time to flourish stannis looked younger because he is no longer brooding despairingly but has been reinvigorated maybe im sure hell be along later and tell us himself "
"1237" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-10 " ntofr1  yeah theyll start filming very soon it takes 6 months to film then theyll need to get the editing done and get it in the can for first week of april "
"1238" "backfromtokyo" 2013-06-10 " killed a few puppies today "
"1239" "DiamondDag" 2013-06-10 " dickvandyke  yeah im not sure how it was better doing it that way with a rather illogical hole in the wall "
"1240" "ntofr1" 2013-06-10 " rpharribo  hooodoooor "
"1241" "ntofr1" 2013-06-10 " hazh  gotta wait a year alas "
"1242" "ntofr1" 2013-06-10 " apparently casting for season 4 has begun "
"1243" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-10 " ntofr1  well probably find out next season obviously other brothers who were there are back as they know commander mormont is dead "
"1244" "SarahHughes" 2013-06-10 " hazh  theyve always said they were splitting book three in half in fact its not strictly speaking in half as the timelines moved a bit so any way those events will be moved over to next season which i think is probably a good thing or else it would seem a little overstuffed "
"1245" "backfromtokyo" 2013-06-10 " i thought bran telling the story tied in quite well with the mystical direction his character is heading as though he felt something terrible had happened and thats why he remembered that particular story at that particular time "
"1246" "ntofr1" 2013-06-10 " jennifera30  is it march yet ill be auctioning the space in my stasis chamber later on "
"1247" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-10 " dickvandyke  stannis  melisandre definitely yes putting bran in a cliffhanger scene was actually what i was referring to as being too soon after red wedding wouldnt have considered a cliffhanger for sansa or arya at this point either "
"1248" "dickvandyke" 2013-06-10 " diamonddag  agreed about the creepy door at the nightfort it seemed a bit ridiculous that there was such an easy passage through the wall i guess logistically the way its done in the books might not work on tv "
"1249" "ntofr1" 2013-06-10 " anonnyscouse  i felt compelled to try and ignore the timing here i would have liked some acknowledgment of what happened at crastors keep though what happened to the brothers who went mental "
"1250" "hazh" 2013-06-10 " i thought this is a disappointing episode last week i was wondering how they are going to fit everything in one episode there are at least 3 major events that should follow from last week and it looks like they simply didnt bother with any "
"1251" "SarahHughes" 2013-06-10 " dickvandyke  stannis and melisandres decision would have got my vote certainly "
"1252" "DiamondDag" 2013-06-10 " rpharribo  yes "
"1253" "ntofr1" 2013-06-10 " dickvandyke  im with you on that it was not the ending i expected or wanted a bit ott "
"1254" "dickvandyke" 2013-06-10 " anonnyscouse  i think they were right not to move any major events forward but i think this episode would have worked better if theyd shown danys scene earlier and maybe ended on stannis and melisandre deciding to head north or if they wanted a visual set piece they could have ended on bran and hodor beyond the wall probably encountering something creepy although they did end with something similar last series "
"1255" "RPHarribo" 2013-06-10 " best hodor ever "
"1256" "DiamondDag" 2013-06-10 " wow they kept the brutality going with that opening poor arya but i like the way that set up her first real kill after witnessing what the freys did to robb and grey wind totally cold and a nice nod to jaqen the hound is just the hound love him again brans story is helped that he crosses paths with someone else this time sam its a small thing but i was a bit disappointed we didnt get the creepy door at the nightfort think it wouldve added extra weirdness lots of old faces turning up again too pyp maester aemon maester pycelle balon ashayara which looks more and more like a pointless name change given the difference in screen time between her and osha but i really hope with yara going after theon badass scene we get more of her next season the ending was a bit meh wasnt it im a bit of a dany apologist but it all went a bit lion king at the end there plus theyre skating onto thin ice with the whole white liberator thing i would make a vague argument that being valyrian means dany isnt technically meant to be european like most of westeros but that gets lost in the show its just the image of a powerful white person freeing lots of poor foreigners they have a long ways to go with how they represent ethnicity on this show and if they whitewash dorne therell be hell to pay highlight of the episode has to be all the stuff on dragonstone love the dynamic between stannis davos and melisandre great performances from all three although i had to laugh that no sooner had stannis let davos out the dungeons he was calling for his head make your mind up dillane do you want his advice or not little thing that i liked getting the story of the rat cook then an immediate cut to walder frey stuffing his face nicely done and a thank you to sarah for the blog and having the time and patience to deal with spoilers and the constant nagging about when this bloody thing gets published youre one of the best reviews of the show honest about its problems when you need to be and always willing to highlight the fun parts of the show which can get lost in all the death and misery its great that this blog seems to have exploded the last few weeks youll be asking for a raise for series 4 i expect "
"1257" "jennifera30" 2013-06-10 " oh and arya killing the blabbermouthed frey man was a stand out sequence as well not just her capacity for brutal violence but her quick thinking and acting abilities reminded me a bit of the scene in the last series when brienne finally got her warrior on with the big mouthed braggarts in the woods wandering soldiers beware of passing women with weapons the hounds warning that she needed to tell him next time she was going to do something like that was fab as well they make a lovely pair "
"1258" "BenjyUK" 2013-06-10 " good episode really enjoyed the lannister scenes in particular but i was really really waiting for something else to happen after the mhysa scene just seemed a little anticlimatic "
"1259" "ntofr1" 2013-06-10 " wow what an amazing series this has been i thought this was a very well balanced episode after the chaos and horror of the rw how arya manages to keep my sympathy whilst stabbing someone in the neck ill never know sure the frey soldier probably deserved his comeuppance if he was telling the truth about his role in stitching grey winds head to robbs body but a killer is a killer whoever they once were and arya is certainly not the girl she once was ramsey ramsey  ramsey finally we can all say ramsay there was something odd about the moment jaime and cercei were united i cant quite put my finger on it even so that was probably the highlight of the episode for me its perhaps the first time i had empathy for cercei and jaimes face was amazing so much love and fear in his eyes he was surely wondering if cercei could still love him in the handless tattered and changed state im going into cryogenic stasis now for a year thank you sarah for 10 well 11 weeks of a superb blog and thanks to all the commenters who make it a stimulating and fun place to spend time when i really should be doing other things did anyone else think stannis looked younger this week "
"1260" "dsk84" 2013-06-10 " anonnyscouse  yeah had it have been revealed earlier non book readers would have in all likelihood identified it as chekovs gun whereas having bran talk about it after the wedding underscores how shocking an event the red wedding was and made more poignant by the fact that brad would have been totally oblivious to it "

"1262" "DanTheMan4815" 2013-06-10 " anonnyscouse  yeah fair point i dont know why but i always seem to forget that varys isnt highborn especially as he has my favorite line on the subject of class differences in westeros why is it always the innocents who suffer most when you high lords play your game of thrones the guys awesome ha "
"1263" "jennifera30" 2013-06-10 " sharon gordon  they said right from the start that book 3 would be split into two series it is often split into two books because it is just so long and packed with events we are nowhere near the end of the third book as far as i can tell "
"1264" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-10 " dsk84  it wasnt that they took less time than jon id expect that but usually theres a sense of time in the show which wasnt there this episode one scene theyre with bran then 23 short scenes elsewhere theyre with aemon "
"1265" "AllenGza" 2013-06-10 " i am the king bless him "
"1266" "SarahHughes" 2013-06-10 " sharon gordon  because theyve split book three in half  loads of stuff still to come next season its too big a book to do in ten eps my guess and its just a guess is that next year will take in second half of book three and some of book four because of time line issues "
"1267" "SarahHughes" 2013-06-10 " backfromtokyo  i suspect were going to deviate from the books a bit and spend some time looking at lannister family dynamics which could be interesting "
"1268" "Sharon Gordon" 2013-06-10 " anyone know why season 3 didnt end with the end of book 3 did they chicken out because people were so upset with last weeks ending does this mean that hell need more seasons than there are books or that they will short change next season "
"1269" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-10 " orpheusliar  like the hiding of ramseys identity the season has been setup to not signpost the red wedding to nonbookreaders that story followed by the red wedding would have raised the suspicions a bit as would the knowledge that rooses bastard was holding theon prisoner but wasnt following the orders of robb having done so "
"1270" "SarahHughes" 2013-06-10 " sarahhughes  anticlimatic ending obviously sorry "
"1271" "jennifera30" 2013-06-10 " oh and twincest is my new favourite word hope i never have to use it in a real life situation but im glad it exists "
"1272" "dsk84" 2013-06-10 " anonnyscouse  the way id possibly rationalise samgilly vs jon is that something that happens in the same episode might not necessarily happen at the same time consider this map httpimageswikiacomgameofthronesimagesccathewallmappngjon and the wildlings had to travel from a much further distance north of the wall than sam then went much further south then jon had to come back north again even discounting for the fact that it would take samgillythe baby longer to travel they would have been travelling 12 or even 13 the distance as jon "
"1273" "SarahHughes" 2013-06-10 " orpheusliar  i wondered about that they could have had it last week but i think that would be have been heavy handed so it would have had to have been earlier and then i think it would have felt a bit random it worked for me because it suggested that retribution will be heading the freys way where as had it aired before you might have shrugged your shoulders not knowing what was coming "
"1274" "backfromtokyo" 2013-06-10 " sarahhughes  i wouldnt have minded if theyd played that scene straighter but it was scored as though it was a big climax i dont think saving theon is high on anyones list of things they care about forgot to say i liked very much the brief almost wordless reunion between jaime and cersei theyve brought him back very quickly though he was absent in the books for a certain purple event thats coming soon "
"1275" "SarahHughes" 2013-06-10 " orpheusliar diddleydum thanks both of you ive loved writing them and the discussion has been pretty brilliant as well "
"1276" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-10 " dickvandyke  they probably had a few endings in mind one which would be a sinister cliffhanger which so soon after red wedding they decided against the other logistically was too difficult to set up given who is needed and where they are at this point so they went with that i agree it was annoying and didnt really suit what has been a great season "
"1277" "OrpheusLiar" 2013-06-10 " sarahhughes  shouldnt this story have been told before the red wedding you know to essentially set up the fact that the betrayal of a guests rights were contrary to all the laws and customs of westeros felt a bit tacked on to explain it after the wedding "
"1278" "Katheartsboo" 2013-06-10 " and so my watch begins twitch "
"1279" "SarahHughes" 2013-06-10 " dickvandyke  i agree which is partially why i barely dwelt on it generally ive enjoyed danys storyline this season but this was an anticlimactic season im not sure what they could have done however  wrapped it up earlier "
"1280" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-10 " dsk84  start of next season the storyline isnt quite up to that point yet "
"1281" "dickvandyke" 2013-06-10 " i thought this was a brilliant episode with the exception of danys ending am i the only person who found it not only excrutiatingly cheesy but also quite underwhelming considering weve already seen dany free the slaves at astapor it just didnt seem like the right way to end this series despite that everything else was perfect im relishing the idea of stannis heading to the wall and hopefully the bolton family will be playing a big role next series "
"1282" "OrpheusLiar" 2013-06-10 " backfromtokyo  it was always going to be difficult to end a season that is essentially half way through one of the books its obviously not going to have same sense of a full completed narrative as seasons 1 and 2 the challenge for the show now will be filling the massive void in the narrative left by robbs death new characters will be introduced and old characters will return or get greater screen time but the first couple of episodes next season will have to strike a fine balance between progressing the existing stories and moving the new plot lines into place with enough pace to make them seem significant im not looking forward to a whole season of dario and dany staring wistfully at each other "
"1283" "jennifera30" 2013-06-10 " sarahhughes  yes she is one to watch isnt she i remember her telling theon not to die so far from the sea in the last series which i also found very moving more yara next series please "
"1284" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-10 " dantheman4815  varys is also lowborn as are some of the nights watch characters like grenn "
"1285" "dsk84" 2013-06-10 " sarahhughes  i do really feel for gendry having spent a weekend a couple of months ago rowing about 25km albeit on incredibly placid waters and having a partner on he same boat and stopping half way i still ended up with a very sore backbackside from what i understand the waters around dragonstone were known to be quite treacherous  i believe thats how robertstannis parents died so it was quite a risk allowing him to escape in that manner "
"1286" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-10 " jennifera30  its always been the way of got to explain the positions and set up new arcs for the next season in ep 10 it makes the recap before ep 1 of next season easier to edit ties up loose ends for characters we may not see for a while too "
"1287" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-10 " felt it was a great follow up to the red wedding there were a lot of great oneliners thrown in to lighten the mood from tywin tyrion sandor sam davos even stannis got a joke in my only gripe was that it seemed a bit wrong with the timing of events the ravens must have been remarkably fast sam  gilly must have sprinted along the top of the wall assuming jon wasnt stupid enough to head straight for castle black last week although that may be up for question he got there very fast with a very clever horse as well "
"1288" "SarahHughes" 2013-06-10 " backfromtokyo  oh i liked yaras scene possibly because im an older sister so got emotional danys i agree with you i was a bit meh largely because it was another isnt dany amazing moment "

"1293" "DanTheMan4815" 2013-06-10 " hello long time reader of the blog season 1 episode 3 i believe first time poster full disclosure ive read the books and i personally dont have a preference on the book vs tv show debate i enjoyed this episode despite it suffering from coming after last weeks amazing episode i can still hear catelyns scream when i close my eyes it was also a bit less of a dramatic ending compared to season 1 and 2 finales the lannisters continue to prove they are probably the most dysfunctional family to ever appear on screen i like everyone else no doubt loves tywin but i cannot wait for him to get some comeuppance for all his scheming i think davos is a fantastic character and as mentioned on previous blogs the only seemingly good guy left in westeros its also interesting to me that he is with the exception of the wildlings the only main character to be lowborn hes also got the same accent as me which is nice finally i dont know how other people would feel about this but there should definitely be a few blogs during the many months we have to wait for the next series perhaps casting updates on the new characters etcwith minimal spoilers of course "

"1307" "Dryhtscipe" 2013-06-10 " quite enjoyed the episode theres some whining out there particularly it appears from fellow bookreaders but i thought it was just perfect largely lowkey but still moving the arcs forward the lowkey nature of much of the episode means the red wedding retains most of the emphasis at the tail end of the season while i have no doubt that the sight of dragons wheeling over a giant crowd is a kind of foreshadowing all its own albeit a blatantly obvious one the only downside for me is the jonygritte scene jon came off as hammy as hell and i was quite happy for him to take a few arrows for what was an awful performance "
"1308" "HowRad" 2013-06-10 " can i just say that i think it bloody despicable that a british national newspaper cant wait one single day before opening this blogyou can spoiler alert all you like doesnt take away the taste of arrogant dismissal of a readership thats put you on the map all these years "

"1312" "shornofthedead" 2013-06-10 " really enjoyed this episode this series followed a quite familiar path that the best hbo shows tend to of a steady build up followed by a massive bloodletting in the penultimate episode and then the final episode gives us glimpses of what we might expect to see next year arggggh next year   i just hope they make another 50 seasons to the same high and improving standard grrm better pull his finger out "
"1313" "Mogwai74" 2013-06-10 " thanks so much sarah for guiding us through this season and thanks to all the contributors here for being so very wise and entertaining there have been some fantastic examinations of various characters reasons and motives its going to be a very long wait till season 4 "
"1314" "Francis Idehen" 2013-06-10 " wonderful season finale for what has been a truly wonderful season well done to the whole team particularly to the younger actors who have been exceptional at times and well done to you too sarah for keeping us all entertained each week with this magnificent blog "
"1315" "dsk84" 2013-06-10 " blog seems to be up earlier today than previous weeks works for me though cause it was a public holiday here so managed to watch the episode earlier than i normally would have i did go visit my grandmother so wasnt as soon as i would have liked but thats fine i did put in on download before i left and after a few hours i said sorry i have to go home now  theres only so long you can wait for game of thrones it was an interesting episode though it did appear to suffer from all the story lines that had to be tied up i totally understand why that was the case but i couldnt help think if they managed to make it a movie length episode some of the story lines would have worked better the episode started off very strong a lot of us book readers were wondering if theyd show greywinds head on robbs body and it sure was creepy my brother who hadnt read the books but had read spoilers seemed more upset by greywinds death than any of the humans so that scene would have been a lot worse for dog lovers tyrion and sansas scene was quite sweet in a somewhat twisted way and it was quite amusing to see tyrion have a list though in a totally different way to aryas it must be said i did love that small council part though after seeing a somewhat softer side of joffrey in the middle of the season it was good seeing back in full douche mode and it was even better seeing tyrion and tywin put him in his place that line about sending the most powerful man in the seven kingdoms to bed without having supper was hilarious and tywin was a total boss again id totally go to bed without supper if he told me to walder and roose was another very strong scene it is interesting though seeing how much roose integrated ramsey into his family despite being a bastard quite a different comparison to someone like gendry who lived in flea bottom all his life in the shadow of his fathers castle or even jon snow who despite being raised by ned stark just didnt seem to have what ramsey has with his roose it was also good to see a lot of screen time given to ser davos it is pretty much accepted now that he is one character who is genuinely good though even there he is a former piratesmuggler so he doesnt have the cleanest of pasts i do wonder how much luck has to play in westeros as his actions were in line with what someone like ned would have done but things just seemed to line up for davos though at the end of that he seemed to wonder how lucky he actually was when he was told hed be leading the red gods army jon snow and jamies scenes didnt really resonate too strongly for me despite being among my favourite characters probably because they were a bit rushed but i dont mind that as there were more important areas that needed the screen time danys ending was ok but it was filled with hope and that was needed after last week not as good an ending as the previous two seasons though "
"1316" "dhulmes" 2013-06-10 " all in all a very good finale for the best season so far i was little disappointed with the final scene but thats probably due to my personal dislike of the dany storyline than for any other reason both in books and on screen loved the throwbacks to previous seasons with the greyjoys and maester aemon returning also thought the boltonfrey scene was great i feared with the loss of the starks we may not see these two great actors for a while once again though my favourite scenes were on dragonstone dillane cunningham and van houten were all wonderful like they have been all season given their final scene their story arc next season is likely to be the best yet so with nine months until my next fix all that remains to be said is and so my watch begins "
"1317" "pindoctor" 2013-06-10 " i do hope shae doesnt live to regret her hottempered rejection of varys jewels i thought varys had those chopped off when he was a boy excellent series and this remains the best got blog by miles thanks sarah "
"1318" "Simgeo" 2013-06-10 " crumbs they do that scene i should have known after drogo ripped a mans tongue out of his throat but even so "
"1319" "Sean_C2" 2013-06-10 " i like how they managed to make the massacre of sansas family all about tyrion who got two scenes about it while sansa got two seconds and no dialogue "
"1320" "Rosimir" 2013-06-10 " nooooo i cant wait at all and id like season 4 to have more than ten episodes ten seems a meagre sum in comparison with other american shows "

"1322" "dirtysexylibertine" 2013-06-10 " edroyle  arya and the hound make the best buddy duo i have seen in the show arya stark being a brutal killer is in my opinion what westoros needs after all that has been done to the stark family "
"1323" "maclean3" 2013-06-10 " i think last weeks episodes and the amount of spoilers i have been victim to has made it impossible for me to wait it out this time definitely spent most of the week waiting for this episode and expect for the ridiculously short amount of jaime returning screentime and the traditional dany is super season ending was pretty much excellent if the goal of this season was to make you conflicted on whether you want stannis or the lannisters to destroy everyone then it succeeded im 6040 team stannis "
"1324" "edroyle" 2013-06-10 " fantastic episode for me the highlight was aryas killing scene with the hound after all shes been through its not surprise that shes edging closer and closer to being a killer it makes a really nice inverse to jaimes story in that when we are first introduced to the two of them arya is a hero jaime a villain yet as the series has gone on weve seen jaime reveal himself as a hero and the beginnings of arya becoming a bruteedged killer also the wolfhead on robbs body was brilliantly shocking "
"1325" "DiddleyDum" 2013-06-10 " a good wrap up for a great season alas for the length of wait until season 4 can i get in early and say a sincere thanks to sarah for putting up this blog too "
"1326" "dirtysexylibertine" 2013-06-10 " so the long wait begins i shall wait diligently until the fourth season of what is the greatest show on television i do not fear for i know winter is coming "
