"2" "bluefinch" 2014-05-26 " in fact i think someones given a lot of thought to the accents  insofar as westeros is based on england the accents reflect that quite well and even things like the stark boys speaking differently from the girls makes sense as in the comments above it seems to me that the accents have been well thought out by someone and they seem to me to be well done by the actors maybe half are doing their own accent  usually the older ones who are already well known like charles dance or david bradley or diana rigg the actors who play jon snow and ygritte are respectively an english and a scottish aristocrat catelyn joffrey davos varys littlefinger are all irish the hound and rob stark are scots jamie is danish tyrion american of course  they all do good and appropriate english accents "
"3" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-05-26 " three days now and they still have the wrong picture posted in the tv section i guess that the people who work for the guardian dont actually read it "
"4" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-05-26 " i dont think that the producers of game of thrones were worried too much about the regional differences of the various actors english accents your average american can pick out a scot and we can tell the difference between rp and a cockney accent but otherwise regional british accents are mostly lost on us one thing ive found interesting is that when english actors put on an american accent the only time i see a complaint is here from brits i guess that for whatever reason most americans just dont find bad american accents as being problematic all of that said we could always rationalize the characters mishmash of accents by noting that even in the real world not everyone from an area ends up with the common local accent people move around and their accent changes and sometimes people regularly use an affected accent "
"5" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-05-26 " the show may not have counted on peter dinklage becoming such a massive star that reminds me of a cameo that dinklage had on entourage ari youre one of the biggest actors in this town peter peter what is that a play on words or something dickhead i tolerate agents i dont like them "
"6" "bluefinch" 2014-05-25 " im quite interested in how they choose the accents  the americans but also scots and irish actors for instance doing various regional english accents so liam cunningham from dublin is doing a northumberland accent but his character is from kings landing so presumably should talk like gendry  did they choose it because dragonstone is roughly in the northeast of westeros or for the same reason they put call centres in the north east because it seems down to earth but trustworthy would an american or global audience pick up on that has anything been written on how they chose and coached the accents for the tv series "
"7" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-05-25 " i agree that tyrion is pretty key to the show and thats partly due to how great peter dinklage is as an actor but the show generally follows the books ive not read them if tyrion is not as key to the books and is killed off i cant see the show taking such a major divergence and keeping him alive the show may not have counted on peter dinklage becoming such a massive star "
"8" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-05-25 " personally i dont mind the plot moving along slowly for the most part as long as there is great dialogue and thought provoking themes in the scenes there normally is so even though the plot with stannis and arya has been slow the dialogue between stannis and davos or arya and the hound has been intriguing and better than any other show i know of in my opinion anyway however this is not the case with brans scenes because they are basically just a bunch of young high born kids with little life experience and hodor there is no chance of a discussion on life after death within this dynamic i also feel with bran that we know almost nothing about what will happen when he gets to this tree other than its really important and so im really not interested in the story arc "

"16" "Macra Bill" 2014-05-23 " it depends what in your opinion the purpose of language is for me the purpose of language is to communicate not to rigidly adhere to arbitrary rules the man would probably be quite puzzled he would probably say to you that of course he knows what the word means but he is using it metaphorically saying he was so angry his face turned red doesnt quite have the same effect even if thats what happened the man wants to explain that said anger was immense and so compares it to someones head literally exploding if i say nick clegg is dead to me of course you know im not trying to convey that cleggy is actually a corpse now but that im comparing him to someone who is actually dead saying im going to ignore nick clegg doesnt quite hit the mark i doubt anyone would say nick cleggs alive so your use of dead is incorrect here get my meaning i understand what youre saying i just dont see why we should get upset over literally rather than other words "

"21" "jimmy_mac" 2014-05-23 " respectfully my difficulty is not with the phrase centered around as opposed to centered on it is understandable that those phrases can both be considered correct and appropriate my beef pardon the colloquial expression is with those who clearly use words incorrectly i suspect that many have not learned the meaning of the word literally yet use it frequently as if they know what it means in so doing they compose sentences for dramatic effect that make no sense eg you should have seen him he was so angry his head literally exploded now in that example i know that the speaker was not trying to convey that the angry mans head actually blew up into a thousand pieces but thats the meaning conveyed to me by use of the improper word because i know what the word literal means and the speaker apparently does not the question then becomes is it rude for me to point out the speakers error to him i suppose thats a debatable question that many answer in the affirmative because nobody wants to look smug or to belittle others by pointing out the others incorrect use of a word they dont the error then gets perpetuated and ultimately the dictionary definition of the word changes to include the erroneous meaning that in my opinion is a shame its permitting the ignorance of language to supplant the knowledge of language for the sake of not hurting the feelings of the ignorant "
"22" "jimmy_mac" 2014-05-23 " it wouldnt surprise me too much if oberyn the viper falls to gregor the mountain because the mountain is as bronn pointed out freakish big and strong and faster than one would expect for a man his size however if oberyn is vanquished i hope tyrion can still avoid execution by banishment to the nights watch without tyrion this show will suffer tyrion is for me one of the few good guys left "
"23" "pdboxer" 2014-05-23 " seeing as we have seen the viper act and talk many times whereas the mountain is such a throwaway irrelevance that we are now on to the 3rd actor portraying him i think it looks like the viper wins then again they did kill ned stark catelyn stark and jodfrey so what do i know "

"42" "EnglishMike" 2014-05-23 " i still love the series but as a nonbook reader i am guessing this has a lot to do with how martins books were written the tv makers may have to push things forward they cant not to without abandoning the books completely they do skip stuff we didnt get to see sansa and littlefinger stopping off at his rather underwhelming home on the way to the eyrie for example but like it or not there continues to be a number of character arcs that arent close to any kind of ultimate conclusion you have to remember that unlike most tv shows where they can decide how much action and fastmoving plot they want to have in each episode game of thrones is by and large forced to follow in the books footstep overall the show runners have done an excellent job and even if there are no worldchanging events for a few episodes the time still flies when im watching theres always plenty going on "

"48" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-22 " think character driven story its not just what happens but why and how some of the stories like the hound and arya dont move the plot along much but we learn a lot about them as people and see them change their story also i think is meant to give us a perspective on the lot of the common people and how they experience war the hound and arya are victims of it war themselves really they meet other people destroyed by war and see a land destroyed by it but still i think a lot has happened plotwise too new king we see the role of lf maybe get some ideas about dorne poor tyrion has lost almost everything jamie and cercei are having a major change in their alliance dany has a working army a cause and is becoming a particular kind of leader and learning the consequences of that the wall is in serious peril with no leadership there are some very odd things happening with spirituality and religion "

"101" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-22 " sois there any agreement on whether tywin knew tyrion was innocent and if he did why has he not pursued the perpetrator or does he know the perpetrators to be the tyrells or does he think it may be the martells and oberyn in particular and even the thot plickens why he has those two families beside him at the trial as judges "
"102" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-22 " ser alan  ser bluegoat if it please your lordships i humbly apologise for my misinterpretation from the tv and beg your forgiveness your greater wisdom and understanding is gathered obviously from the scripts my own perhaps oversimplistic interpretation was that the crowns coffers were in a right pickle and as lf had been master of the coin he must be complicit in some way by association as above i didnt see it as blatant incompetence he is no numpty and has made a good fist of very competently climbing out of poverty and seems to run an astute financial ship where his brothels are concerned but rather a part of his chaos creationist scheme to undermine robert or whoever sat atop the iron throne thus creating a position of considerable weakness for the crown and a situation from which he would no doubt be able to profit at some point in the future and in which case you could describe his scheming or call it witnessing first hand what the state of the balance sheet really was and choosing not to protest or do anything about it as brilliant yes "

"105" "malevoisine" 2014-05-22 " forgot to mention that establishing identity is important  bran and rickon have been gone for so long that if either of them really did try to claim winterfell they could be accused of being pretenders we all know how much grrm likes his wars of the roses references and we all know what happened to the poor sods who turned up in henry viis reign pretending to be the princes in the tower "

"107" "malevoisine" 2014-05-22 " wasnt the ranging in series 2 partly done in order to find benjen i remember his horse came back without him and when jon was taking his vows they found those dead crows that had gone with him that turned out to be not quite as dead as previously thought as for rickon becoming the lord of winterfell dont forget that most people dont know that bran and rickon are still alive  theons stunt with the burnt farmers boys was awfully convincing ramsay snow roose bolton jon and sam think those are the only people who know other than the people with them of course and probably varys because varys knows everything so robb is very dead jon is a bastard bran and rickon are presumed dead  there go the stark boys in fact out of all the stark children only sansa is in a position to claim winterfell and shes at the mercy of whatever petyr baelish decides to manipulate her into next if tyrion is convicted or something else happens to him shell be free to marry again and whoever she does marry will have a pretty good claim to winterfell or if their rules are anything like ours the marriage can be annulled on the grounds on nonconsummation dont rule out arya yet either although at this point she seems much likelier to take the iron throne by killing everyone else than regaining winterfell through marriage "

"118" "elleesse" 2014-05-22 " and sansas  while outside at the eeyrie they were a strange painted on black colour that looked really odd and fake "
"119" "elleesse" 2014-05-22 " do we really need melisandre and stanniss wife in a scene when we want to see stannis and davos and like you know all the other more important characters in the show yeah butobviously what was discussed that the red god has a use for the daughter that selsye hates her daughter and would be happy to get rid of her from the sounds of it means that nice little girl is in danger which is plot driving stuff if you ask me it also showed the jealousy and strange relationship between the two women perhaps that jealousy will build later on and be dangerous for melissandre and her position who knows for all those reasons and more i disagree that it is pointless  "
"120" "elleesse" 2014-05-22 " maybe littlefingers less psychopathmaking everything you do is wonderful even the evil stuff style of parenting  which i imagine will involve discipline respect punishment for wrongdoing and manipulation into doing other things might result in a changed personality perhaps you may even feel sad for him should he ever tip over the edge of that moon door "
"121" "elleesse" 2014-05-22 " remember he complained about that taking her was the worst decision ever now that there is a price on his head and that he wished he hadnt bothered maybe he would ordinarily just kill her and be done with it rather than carry on with men jumping out here and there trying to get their rewardmy point is perhaps on some subtle level arya realises that actually hes been rather good to her considering "
"122" "elleesse" 2014-05-22 " ooh clever you yes that could very well happen desire is littlefingers main weakness that and being rather shortsansa was towering over him in one scene "

"129" "MrMsyvc" 2014-05-21 " sandor and arya are definitely an interesting pair i was hoping sandor would exact revenge against his brother but its looking like someone may beat him to it i havent read the books but im guessing sandor may someday give his life to save arya bloody altruism it will get you every time "
"130" "LordMeowingtons" 2014-05-21 " another quality episode really enjoying this season even if alot of the middle episodes have that kind of slow build up to a big ending kind of feeling to them not that that is a bad thing ive enjoyed the lotthe oberyn and tyrion scene was so good so well acted by both of them really like the oberyn character after abit of an iffy start when he first arrived what about what i wantjustice for my sister cannot wait for the fight against the mountain the tankwas good to see the vulnerable side of the hound too he is a cold hearted bugger but i cant stop feeling a little bit sorry for himhot pie brought some comedy to the episode which was amusing to watch loved the expression of brienne when hot pie pulled up a stool oh for fuckwhat are you doing please shut up kind of faceand then there was littlefinger oh littlefinger i do like how the story is all panning out and that he has caused so much carnage in westeros but i do sometimes wonder how he has managed to get so far of course he is good at what he does but even so i hope sansa does him in one of the future series roll on the next episode "
"131" "baldynapper" 2014-05-21 " to be fair to jorah if my choice was between getting my head cut off or turning up at the wall and explaining to jeor mormont that id made a right pigs ear of ruling his lands id probably scarper as well "

"134" "Greenseer" 2014-05-21 " interesting observation i have been quietly impressed with sophie turners progression as an actress since the first season she is only 18 and very inexperienced but we have seen her grow into the role but i would agree that she works best with good actors around her  playing opposite headey dinklage etc has helped her no end i do slightly worry now if she is in for a run of scenes with hbos very own walking weirwood aidan gillen poor sophie  hang in there girl "
"135" "Silgen" 2014-05-21 " he choose a mockingbird for his sigil and what is a mockingbird famous for mimicking the songs of other birds perhaps aiden gillens performance as littlefinger is more subtle than hes given credit for "

"140" "pseudosp1n" 2014-05-21 " but its not a spoiler so dont worry it is revealing whether or not characters are living or dead at a later point in the story is a spoiler you didnt even need to post the spoiler bit in order to make your point you could have just quoted from the books "
"141" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-21 " im not willing to stand behind my sources i should say  its just internet gossip but it would explain his seeming tendency to do what looks like the most immediately advantageous thing for himself people like that are a pain to work with "

"143" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-21 " maybe explaining the food production issues of westeros wouldnt make for great tv "
"144" "AlanTyndall" 2014-05-21 " i dont remember it either rather than money it was food supplies the martels were supposed to bring to the lannister fold the riot in which bronns new wife was raped was mainly to do with the lack of food the fat high septon was also killed by hungry masses during that riot and i think a few tradesmen were murdered for hoarding food i guess the tv show has gone its own way on this issue "
"145" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-21 " its worth noting that tywin was talking about lannister money not the crowns coffers lf had nothing to do with that the money was spent by tywin on bribes and raising his army the red wedding didnt come cheap i expect it almost seemed from his description that they were basing all their wealth on just gold from their mines why they didnt invest some of it over the years i dont know  it seems totally bizarre to me i think that is actually a change from the books where i dont remember anything about the lannisters being broke in the story so far or am i misremembering "
"146" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-21 " as alan said lf brought the crowns incomes up to never before seen heights through investments largely whiich is probably why the iron bank was willing to make such large loans but he didnt control spending decisions robert had no sense of balance in anything it seems "
"147" "Drgonzo123" 2014-05-21 " i think anyone who spares with the mountain would end up dead or injured he would only have one way of fighting and that would be to the death he was after loras tyrell until robert told him to stop "
"148" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-21 " yes thats true i think i tend to the view that they somehow bring the cold with them because whenever they show up they seem to be preceded by a sort of weird unnatural and very local cold but that is really just a guess "
"149" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-21 " yup its certainly possible it could be a fair fight perhaps they will fall in love and spawn a race of huge children actually i have a pretty good idea but i am also not happy about waiting two weeks "

"157" "Dewulf" 2014-05-21 " im guessing that was for 2 reasons 1 to even up the ration of malefemale nekkidness on the show 2 to just focus on dany being in control oh and 3 emilia clarke had been naked enough already lol she has a film career to think about now and fair enough too "
"158" "Dewulf" 2014-05-21 " yep i agree its not the best fight to base comparisons on too many unusual factors fire being the biggest of them guess i was just trying to say whilst the hound is undoubtedly one of the baddest men top 5 as far as the show goes i suppose in the kingdom hes not unbeatable meanwhile brienne in the show has shown shes good against a number of top contenders namely loras and jaime all the same theyll probably end up missing each other branstyle or something maybe the hound in his weakened state cant handle a bunch of lannisters and bri come to the rescuelol idk just imagining anything at this stage gah 2 weeks "
"159" "aj2014" 2014-05-21 " its ok i just googled it i didnt know that scarlett johansson scifi movie had so much sex and nudity in it including boners "
"160" "Dewulf" 2014-05-21 " lets clarify  im sure he had training on how to swing a sword etc when he was growing up and that got reinforced in duels and on the battlefield but now hes huge and he can win without using high level technique people with that kind power can often become lazy and stop pushing themselves plus no one with any sort of decent technique eg maybe meryn would want to get his a handed to him even in a sparring session cos he doesnt hold back sohe takes what practise he can get and probably doesnt mind too much since he thinks his natural size and power is always going to win it for him anyway like tywin says he aint bright "
"161" "AlanTyndall" 2014-05-21 " i never got the impression he mismanaged anything it was robert who demanded more and more money lfs talent was finding it and it went far beyond securing loans he literally took control of commerce in kings landing and beyond by putting competent smallfolk loyal to him in place of incompetent highborns loyal to themselves he took loans reinvested paid them off but roberts spending was out of control lf had no reason to stop him even if he could hes the genial man who does as his king commands the debts were well known to the small council its worth noting that tywin was talking about lannister money not the crowns coffers lf had nothing to do with that the money was spent by tywin on bribes and raising his army the red wedding didnt come cheap i expect "

"165" "Drgonzo123" 2014-05-21 " how can you cover up the murder of lysa arryn or is littlefinger just going to use the blackfish excuseshes gone a piss "
"166" "Dewulf" 2014-05-21 " yeah look we know she wasnt at the red wedding and i wasnt trying to say she actually personally killed them all but it seems she understands that whilst she didnt kill cat directly herself her actions led to cat being at risk at war and eventually being killed she says my father my husband my sister they all stood between us and now theyre all dead given she directly killed her husband and indirectly put her sister in serious danger eventually leading to her death the question is then why does she think its relevant to mention her father in the same group as the first two and maybe thats where the speculation endsjust thought it was interesting keeping in mind of course that lf would want the father dead right could have been poison from one of his operatives  shed still see it as lf doing what he had to for their love "

"170" "Janel Jones" 2014-05-21 " but once he reflects after his outburst hes got to know tywin has set this all up thats what is out of character is the weakness of all lannister men the one woman they irrationally love but yes tywins paternal talk to tommen did seem to reference the family with the navy versus the one with fields to gorw food "
"171" "Dewulf" 2014-05-21 " unless you know you have an edge loras beat the mountain in a joust because he was good and he had a trick up his sleeve the viper may have the same or he may just be that good would bruce lee or at least the movie characters he played take on and beat someone bigger than him yes yes he would probably in both cases too knowing youre that good allows you to do things that would be stupid for others "

"200" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-05-21 " firstly i dont think tyrion is as smart as tywin his temper has compromised him i dont think that would happen to tywin secondly when tywin was coaching tommen and asked him about alliances how to know which ally was best lng term i got the distinct impression he was talking about the martells and tyrells who have been long time enemies he seems to be indicating that he must choose between them because he can only have one as an ally "
"201" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-21 " that is the only explanation i can come up with as well ive wondered how well lf knew tyrion before the books start i cant quite decide if tyrion was mainly living in kings landing or casterly rock before the trip up north i rather think it was casterly rock in the book they dont replace tyrion as master of coin until after the trial "
"202" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-21 " the fact that the crown was seriously in debts wasnt lfs doing and it wasnt due to his mismanagement in fact his management was considered pretty brilliant he wasnt the one spending the money the fact that it was a revelation to tyrion upon taking over the office was a bit odd since ned stark discovered it his first day as hand "
"203" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-05-21 " i think its more the case that people dont believe things that they have never seen happen thorne knows the history of the wall and believes what has been will always be similarly last week tywin believed that just because there hadnt bee a full sized dragon in 200 years there never would be again practical people are often limited by te scope of their own imagination "

"209" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-05-21 " i suspect its because tyrion is smart enough to see through his act cersei isnt littlefinger is in a much better position once tyrion is out of the way who is the master of coin now i assume its not tyrion could littlefinger come back to kl would he want to now that hes safe high up in the eyrie "

"273" "DiamondDag" 2014-05-20 " well my point isnt that those people you name are angels more that most of them have shown some form of compassion for others or something to suggest they arent entirely obsessed with themselves or their family like cersei is theyve had difficult lives but it hasnt entirely corrupted them arya is a bit of a weird one because i think the show has been too eager to turn her into a killer as fan service without showing that shes still an angry and scared child trying to survive hell even the hound has shown more empathy for others than cersei has and hes got bile to spare then theres one person that had a father who was probably even worse than tywin and they turned into one of kindest most gentle characters in the story sam tarly so i dont mean to sound like im saying cersei is the only person to do horrible things she certainly isnt i just dont feel anything in her life justifies why shes such a horrible wretch i can almost feel something when shes trying to protect her children but even then if she didnt treat everyone around her like dirt maybe shed have a few more allies fighting her corner "

"280" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-20 " im not sure we could compare the fight with beric the hound was hungover and beric had a flaming sword also  i dont think being resurrected depletes him physically so much as spiritually and morally he becomes less human "
"281" "SwashbucklingStuff" 2014-05-20 " plus the whole reason for that emotional piece of dialogue between the two in the dungeons in the last episode was partly to depict oberyns sympathy for tyrion the idea that oberyn hates all lannisters without exception is mainly put forward by the lannisters themselves to hide the fact that some of them deserve his hatred this idea is then played upon by oberyn also ties in nicely with jorahs comment that in war there are good and evil people on both sides "

"316" "MDH64" 2014-05-20 " centred on not around does anyone so much as look at this stuff before its posted online "

"318" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-05-20 " i do hope so it seemed to me pod was at one path and brienne the other plus my westeros orientation is all over the place i had an idea of looney lysa being north west for some reason "
"319" "dsk84" 2014-05-20 " the mrs felt bad for lysa though i told her i was glad to see her fly dont know if i should have revealed that though "
"320" "Aelfwine" 2014-05-20 " in the books we go from theon directly to reek in the series you see him degrade week by week i think the series did a good job showing us how utterly dehumanised theon has become in spite of the fact that we dont have access to reeks inner monologue  his obsession with his name his constant fear etc now part of it is due to that questionable torture storyline in season 3 but allen still deserves some credit for his performance esp in season 4 "

"322" "Aelfwine" 2014-05-20 " and episode 10 is going to have a few key moments in also one at least oho you dont say theres an epilogue im definitely looking forward to speaking of which but trying to stay crypticnonspoilery enough a certain scene that in the books happens right before it and is somewhat connected to it has been moved forward a lot and im not sure how i feel about that "
"323" "Aelfwine" 2014-05-20 " english isnt my first language so im not too bothered either the ridiculous husky voice though ah well i did like him in the last scene "

"325" "MsEnvelop" 2014-05-20 " i enjoyed the show and sarahs recap is great as usual i am very worried about shireen i think this girl has more wisdom than all westeros and esteros combined she would make a great queen oh may all the seven gods old and new protect her from her freaky mother and the red woman i am not sure who terrifies me more i am growing very curious about sansas arc and here is my speculation i think she heard lysas confessions about her killing her husband and how she started the war at this point sansa is one step ahead of lf because he does not know that she knows so far sansa has been portrayed as a naive and even stupid girl although we all admired her ability to survive she is changing though she did not kill lysa and nor was she able to do it but she will cover up for lf and she will do it so well that we ill see even lf will be impressed and begin to desire her even more because of this "

"332" "RedCat21" 2014-05-20 " daario wasnt a great character in the books either very onedimensional and uninspiring neither daariosin the tv series has really worked its a bit of a shame i still think carcetti playing littlefinger is the worst casting decision on got hes such a central character but carcetti has neither the depth nor the menace to portray him accurately "
"333" "Macra Bill" 2014-05-20 " your going to have to name these characters because from those i can think of who have had less than stellar childhoods their behaviour hasnt been without some disgusting acts arya seems fine to go around slicing people up the hound too tyrion is hardly an angel theres gendry and davos who would have grown up hard but not being noble granted them a degree of freedom "

"340" "Clariana" 2014-05-20 "  or perhaps he really did believe sansa may have done it "
"341" "Clariana" 2014-05-20 " i really do like though how alliser is continually throwing in jons face that he is just a steward as if when the chips were down that would make any difference "
"342" "Clariana" 2014-05-20 " i think ned thought he would have quite enough on his plate by becoming unexpectedly the lord of winterfell ned was not an overreacher robert on the other hand simply did not think things through and became an unhappy and awful king "
"343" "TessaInWonderland" 2014-05-20 " at least sansa wont have to marry that little twit now though "
"344" "Janel Jones" 2014-05-20 " this is what grips us the many possible manipulations that tywin must be contemplating im disappointed that tyrion isnt outthinking him "
"345" "malevoisine" 2014-05-20 " tyrions accent came up in the comments discussion last week with respect to whether or not he still deserves an emmy ill quote what i said i think he deserves it because this is probably the first time ive managed to not care at all about an american actor messing up a british accent he inhabits the role so perfectly for me that he could start speaking like omid djalili and i dont think i would even notice "
"346" "Clariana" 2014-05-20 " samuel beckett specialist barry mcgovern who cameoed as a dying man so got now has special guest stars who come on to die somehow that seems appropriate "
"347" "zTom" 2014-05-20 " am i the only one who thought the previous daario stuck out of the great cast like a sore thumb he looked like a mix between fabio and casper van dien with even less acting skills and more vacuous if thats possible that new guy as a cheeky vibe at least and was properly badass when he dispatched the meereen champion "
"348" "Janel Jones" 2014-05-20 " its always a balance between something nasty  ramsay snow or crasters keep or lysa and sansa  something wellintentioned and the silly and sexy eg dany i thought the balance pretty spot on in mockingbird especially in the runup to the big sword fight next ep "

"353" "Owlyross" 2014-05-20 " id say the opposite in the books we go from theon directly to reek in the series you see him degrade week by week from proud ironborn to humiliation to capture to torture to losing his humanity i think hes done amazingly well "
"354" "Janel Jones" 2014-05-20 " found that sansa  robyn  petyr dynamic quite disconcerting can petyr really not help himself when he sees a beautiful young sansacatelyn "
"355" "oldtimer1955" 2014-05-20 " yes  and not bloody epicentered either which means something completely different to how it gets used "
"356" "TessaInWonderland" 2014-05-20 " absolutely loved this episode loved the scenes with tyrion especially that moment with oberyn loved the slap go sansa and loved the end although littlefinger kissing sansa made me yelp  "

"360" "Tooncgull" 2014-05-20 " ive read the books but not seen any of the tv  its quite interesting to pop in here and see where you guys are in the story "
"361" "steve3742" 2014-05-20 " tyrells dammit no apostrophe "
"362" "steve3742" 2014-05-20 " i think the assasination was coorganised by baelish and olenna with tywin giving his blessing i cant see that i think the poisoning took tywin by surprise after the fact he probably worked out that it was the tyrells but what to do then accuse them of regicide breaking apart the alliance and probably dooming the lannisters hold on power or pretend not to know and even use it to get rid of the child hes always hated whilst simultaneously forcing the other one back into the fold ned stark would have chose the first one of course but ned stark is dead his heir is dead and the power of the north is broken "
"363" "ilbirbone" 2014-05-20 " i think tywin is naturally the most isolated of all the characters in that everyone else has a confidante or at least someone they feign trust in and we get a glimpse of their inner motivations but not with him he definitely thought joffrey was a loose cannon so he might have been happy to use his demise to his advantage but that still leaves someone whos thinning the lannister blood line out there "
"364" "Aelfwine" 2014-05-20 " well he could be rory mccann was born in 1969 hafthór björnsson in 1988 "
"365" "tronald" 2014-05-20 " i know its not a big deal in the grander scheme of things but its a very important part of a very important characters history and it shaped who she became they made the time to shed some light on the hound and it was very well done i think the same could have been done for cersie theres still time i suppose "
"366" "ocelot75" 2014-05-20 " the smug look on her face strolling out to greet the mountain priceless "
"367" "bleudegex" 2014-05-20 " i dont think tywin knew about it or gave the go ahead hes not a kinslayer i just think once it happens hes clever enough to work out the tyrells were behind it and he knows that having joffrey dead is good for the family so hes not that bothered he definitely doesnt know about baelishs involvement  if he did then hed be seriously worried now that baelish potentially has the armies of the vale behind him "
"368" "Resurgam" 2014-05-20 " total digression now but that show was the best scripted ever beating got i think bullock after the indian fight that indian fought like hell…charlie figured out how it must have been the indian had to kill me for comin on the burialplace and maybe it had been me too who had killed his friend cut his friends head off so his friend wouldnt have eyes to see the sunset all those years hed be lyin there dead so he had to kill me for that too and he couldnt before hed laid hands on me or the killing wouldnt be honorable we fought like fucking hell ill tell you that much and i never once had the upper hand it just happened out the way it happened out he was just trying to live same as me and do honor to his friend and make some fucking sense out of things and we wind up that way and i wind up after beatin him till i couldnt recognize his face for christs sake "

"372" "Owlyross" 2014-05-20 " with rorge and biter dead that does leave brienne and pods story a bitwell up in the air makes me wonder if one of the big scenes a lot of us have been anticipating wont actually make it this season still theyre a fun double acti suppose next theyll manage to bump into gendry somehow i reckon theyll get there but it will be more of a stumble into it kind of thing rather than the rescue by the brotherhood "
"373" "monkey2" 2014-05-20 " if tywin knows the tyrells are behind it then olenna would have already considered this and either discussed it with tywin or let him know she knows in some other way remember that walk they had in the gardens i cant stop thinking of south park when i see people walking in the royal gardens  its really just about us getting xboxes what ever way it was done tywin gave must have given the tyrells the go ahead its like godfather 2 when hyman roth gives his blessing to the risotta brothers to kill frank pentageli so with that in mind i think the assasination was coorganised by baelish and olenna with tywin giving his blessing im still not sure if tywin knew that baelish was involved as baelishs involvement was by his admission a couple of episodes ago part of a newly formed loyalty to the tyrellsat the expense of the lannisters "
"374" "mikebhoy" 2014-05-20 " weakest episode of the series so far overall tyrions scenes were great likewise melisandre and selyse but aidan gillans scenerychewing and pantomime accent were almost unwatchable add to that the utterly predictable ending i expect next episode to be filler before the big fight in ep9 and then the lowkey aftermath episode that tends to finish each series "

"380" "monkey2" 2014-05-20 " yes i agree ned saw himself as honourable i think though the question this raises which is perhaps the metanarrative of game of thrones is that honour is a complete fallacy this is not demonstrated by anyone better than ned additionally the starks and this must be neds lasting legacy is that justice is tied up with entitlement arya demonstrates this better than anyone "
"381" "dsk84" 2014-05-20 " in fact during that scene during the second season a rather large lady was seen as getting raped well stripped at the time anyway and i just assumed that was lollys "
"382" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-20 " no she said they were dead but she didnt kill them "
"383" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-20 " my guess is that he knows but plans to deal with it in some other way or even ignore it and we dont know if he has gone to any effort to confirm his knowledge in other ways the trial is convenient for him i think attacking the tyrells might cause problems right now "

"389" "malevoisine" 2014-05-20 " the title of episode 9 is the watchers on the wall so surely that means we must be on for some serious wall action in that episode you would think anyway am intrigued as to what the title of episode 10 refers to the children doesnt give much away i can think of at least 3 different interpretations "
"390" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-20 " see numerous threads last week for same that said i dont think it was answered satisfactorily the outcome at least until the possibility of jamie championing tyrion arose suited him perfectly some then think that he does think tyrion did it and in which case his lack of detective work is credible ish  surely he would have wanted to confirm it others myself included think he knew tyrion was innocent fine but that stumps me as to why he didnt then pursue the real culprit he must have at last suspected oberyn lately arrived and full of antilannister threats hes just too shrewd not to want to understand the threat even if he chooses not to avenge the death on behalf of the family "
"391" "Aelfwine" 2014-05-20 " nah tormund "
"392" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-20 " i have a feeling guys that tall can complicate things on tv and movies but it could be that hes a bit picky as well and entertainment seems to be fickle and nonsensical a lot of the time ive seen a bit of book group but it doesnt seem to have ever been available here in canada "
"393" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-20 " yes he was being a serious brat and he was a bit younger and sansa didnt slap him she grabbed his doll that he was pretending was a giant destroying the castle and its head ripped off then he had an epilectic seizure i dont think they have included that part of his character in the show and the maester had to take him away it seemed a little more likely to me they are making her on the show i think rather cruel which i didnt see in the books at all even as she became more aware of what was going on around her "
"394" "bleudegex" 2014-05-20 " to be fair i think hes a worlds strongest man competitor from a foreign country not an actor but youre right hopefully theyll keep his lines to a minimum "
"395" "parkin13" 2014-05-20 " so far id say hes smart he just picked a straight up fight with the mountain that is not smart "
"396" "EvsMcGinface" 2014-05-20 " besides aesthetically women are far more attractive naked men look ridiculous naked from the waist down matter of opinion really as a straight woman i personally find naked men more attractive "
"397" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-20 " yes there are all kinds of possibilities but some people seem to think that marrying lysa actually made him lord of the vale and that isnt the case his position is more precarious than that and at least for now he needs robyn alive id say "
"398" "dsk84" 2014-05-20 " even the stranger "
"399" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-20 " yes i see what you mean i dont find her story the most compelling myself but if you think about it i think there are things going on what seems like her easy success is perhaps not as interesting but what will its fruits be i think maybe we are going to begin seeing some of that by the end of this season both politically and perhaps personally we have quite a few indications that she is at risk of becoming a real tyrant that she may find she has trouble actually ruling that her dragons are becoming wild and she has no idea how to control them they are big now but she hasnt ridden them or apparently even tried and what will happen with jorah who was recently mentioned in the small council meeting i think they may have underemphasised some of the practical difficulties with her army that made her stop in meereen  feeding them and such and im not crazy about the actress  i find her rather onedimensional and i wonder how much more someone else might have brought to the role as its been written if we knew more about what she felt would she seem more interesting "
"400" "chriskilby" 2014-05-20 " thats cos tywin was probably in on it "

"402" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-20 " lets hope ayra and the hound dont get jobs at dignitas in geneva a kindness perhaps but their joint bedside manner left something to be desired for those wanting to shuffle this mortal coil and is best filed under blunt but effective "
"403" "chriskilby" 2014-05-20 " so you have "
"404" "ilbirbone" 2014-05-20 " theres something that i cant quite reconcile in what has otherwise been some excellent deviousness knowing theres every possibility that tyrion is innocent at no time has tywin the master conspirator himself considered who else might have murdered joffrey and thus a threat to the lannisters cersei points a finger at the first most obvious and ludicrous of suspects and the plot has just jogged along a linear trial path it doesnt seem to reconcile with his callous and calculating character as well as the interwoven plot lines in every other respect that he of all protagonists appears to have a plan a and not much else has been suggested "
"405" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-20 " well the dragons anyway my point though is that with dany and some of the other charachters as well people are always ask what they are doing wandering around when thhey are going to get there and do something but that really assumes that people know where the story is going and why its a heavily plotted story in some ways but i wouldnt really say that it was mainly plot driven its also very character driven and i guess what you might call ideological "

"436" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-05-20 " yeh i agree there was a moment during the trial when shae was speaking her intention was to shock the audience and tarnish tyrions reputation but i think it had the opposite effect on oberyn he seemed impressed with tyrions tendency for depravity plus the whole reason for that emotional piece of dialogue between the two in the dungeons in the last episode was partly to depict oberyns sympathy for tyrion the idea that oberyn hates all lannisters without exception is mainly put forward by the lannisters themselves to hide the fact that some of them deserve his hatred this idea is then played upon by oberyn i think tywin will be happy for the viper to defend tyrion tywin didnt want tyrion to die just to be sent to the wall if oberyn kills the mountain tywin will hope that his quest for vengeance is over doubtful in fact this is better for tywin because he can now keep his son who he dislikes but wants to see carry on the family line in kings landing and still say to cersei look i gave him a trial and he came through  what more do you want "

"733" "Dukered" 2014-05-20 "  i was oddly moved by the hounds moment then by oberyns story its funny  i do remember the passage from the book but not being especially touched by it thats because the viper told the story in a different context  long before joffreys wedding the trial etc it was at the meet and greet when oberyn first arrived at kings landing i wondered at the time why they replaced that whole conversation with a fairly pointless scene in a brothel "

"736" "Dukered" 2014-05-20 " its a decent show and has fantastic acting and sets personally i find the multiple strains of narrative that progress by 45 minutes per episode challenging and unsatisfying in a nutshell this is what leaves me underwhelmed this season although i thought this was the best episode this series since the first one they take one characters 30 page chapter and made it last about 4 episodes by inching it forward 4 mins at a timeand then they do the same with every other character it does test my patience a bit because you have to wait for weeks for something meaningful to happen to certain characters  ie it takes that long to see each characters chapter completed on screen "

"744" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-05-20 " the balance of the scene is how matter of fact oberyn is about everything he rakes up a horribly painful truth for tyrion and recounts like its as relevant to him as hot pies gravy recipe in a show that often verges on earnest over acting he does a great line in laid back smouldering the scene with bronn was beautifully played too even if it contained another harsh truth for tyrion they have never really been friends because they have never been equal bronn likes tyrion because hes good company but he kills people beacuse hes paid to taking on the mountain is too much risk for too little reward how many times have you risked your life for me and in that one phrase he illustrated the nature of tyrions relationships all his friends and lovers are bought and paid for thats all well and good until somebody offers more as jaime learned when he crossed paths with locke there are some things you cant buy your way out of one of the great things about got is that it clearly shows how the rules are different for the rich and powerful those who are born low tend to stay there and they are fodder to be sacrificed for the whims of the highborn bronn was a low born cut throat who say tyrion as his meal ticket hes done well from the deal with a title a wife and home but like varys he knows his place even if he were to defeat the moutain his troubles would just be starting "

"767" "Dukered" 2014-05-20 " weve got so little information on her that the tragedy of her death doesnt seem as sad as it was by all accounts she was a kind and loving woman and it also adds to the puzzlement as to why the supposedly noble and wise prince rheagar did what he did good points you really feel for elia in the books but i bet most viewers have no idea who she was which is a shame "
"768" "supermazin" 2014-05-20 " this season has been dissapointing they have done a lot of straying awayabridging the books which is good because affc and adwd were terribly paced books but they have done so poorly the attempted rescue of theon seemed rushed as if the director wanted to get it over with asap "

"783" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-20 " its hard to even pin down what is meant by gods the old gods seem to be a sort of animism or maybe pantheism the new gods despite appearances seem to be a monotheistic religion as does the fire god and then there is witchcraft and we dont know how that is supposed to work other than some sort of dealing with demonic forces obviously these things arent all true if any are i think you are right about the fire god being some sort of nasty being rather than a god "

"786" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-20 " yes i think that is so it just doesnt seem like what we generally see in westeros a king might get away with that stuff but not some knight even with a king i think people would not look on it all that well "

"788" "Dukered" 2014-05-20 " i think shes seeing things a bit more clearly now though the squabble with robin seemed to undermine the idea that shes growing a bit wiser admittedly this is not a spoiler but might offer some insight into thisin the book i seem to recall that sansa was already quite emotional in that scene before the tiff with robin while the tv audience gets that she may have been feeling homesick i dont think that scene portrayed quite how depressed sansa was feeling at that time or how bloody long it took her to build that winterfell snow castle when she snapped at robin on the show it seemed petulant but in the book it was a more emotional reaction "
"789" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-20 " yes i think if he needed her he wouldnt have done it she just became more of a complication than a useful tool  she was always going off halfcocked i do think though that kissing sansa might have been a spur of the moment thing which would be interesting if true "

"797" "JanfransZuidema" 2014-05-19 " i havent read the books i believe that people who have dont get to enjoy the television series to the fullest got is a wonderful tv series i dont need to know every single thing about oberyns past to understand his need for justice he explained it three times i have no reason to doubt him "
"798" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-19 " yeah  its obviously the kind of thing that is a matter of opinion but it seems to have been so widely held that he was all that but he was a jerk to his wife and the starks and and weak to let his father go on the way he was without doing anything "
"799" "Clariana" 2014-05-19 " interesting that our viewpoints of the twins cersei and jaime veer off in exactly different directions with cersei going from nebulous good to unmitigated evil and jaime from unmitigated evil to nebulous good "

"802" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-19 " it was ridiculous no matter what he was doing trial by combat between a peasant and a trained knight the criminal would never request it and no judge would decide to do it  it would be totally not the thing ser gregor isnt a lord so doesnt get to judge trials at all much less in kings landing "

"850" "objectinspace" 2014-05-19 " god that was excellent slightly offbeat in the vale but the best episode for some time not as dramatic as tyrions trial perhaps but so much more revealing enthralling and moving all the tyrion scenes were superb if dinklage deserves an emmy it is for this weeks dialogues with jamie bronn and oberyn not for last weeks trial arya and the hound were also superb "
"851" "zephirine" 2014-05-19 " bluegoat my feeling is that in the story world the gods exist but are largely indifferent to what people want or do  people interpret the signs of divine intervention according to their own motivation so melisandre has been telling us what the lord of light wants but how far is all that the product of her own mind witchcraft seems to be real though and melisandres obviously playing with some nasty beings of some sort hence the smoky babything "

"857" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-19 " and it also adds to the puzzlement as to why the supposedly noble and wise prince rheagar did what he did yes it always seems to me like he was a pretty weak person for all everyone talks about how great he was "
"858" "CitizenWolf" 2014-05-19 " maybe thats the thing maybe he is irish in the westeros world i mean not in real life because well he is irish in real life and at some stage maybe hell surprise us all and tell us about his early days in dublin selling cockles and mussels "
"859" "Aelfwine" 2014-05-19 " i really really hated the opening bits with the mountain going after the peasants it seemed pretty unlikely even in the context of westeros maybe if hed been at his own place where he could keep it quiet or in the cities across the sea where there is slavery but not in the open in kings landing someone suggested to me that perhaps the peasants were people whod been condemned to death anyway which i suppose might make it a bit more understandable pretty ridiculous either way though "

"866" "X11Ray" 2014-05-19 " i havent read the books and i dont know what will happen but it seems rather unlikely that the mountain will win oberyns and tyrions life depends on it their part in the story far outweighs that of the mountain and for both there seems to be a huge potential for further character development hes done it before but i doubt that martin would have two main characters killed by a near nobody also the actor playing the mountain is no professional actor they would have cast him differently if he were to play any particular role right anyway cant wait for the fight "

"872" "lichkingsmum" 2014-05-19 " a woman hopes he makes another appearance later on in the story "
"873" "losshakers" 2014-05-19 " perhaps because he lured honest ned stark to his doom at kings landing by way of humping the crazed sister of the woman he proclaims to love and having her kill her husband honest jon arryn perhaps because he handed ros over to joffrey for target practise littlefinger doesnt limit himself to killing fucks but rather hes willing to fuck and fuck over quite literally anyone when he calculates that doing so will advance his own cause "

"900" "DidoTwite" 2014-05-19 " i will be your champion fist pumps all round but dinklage stole the show again for me this week acting his ass off with barely a line i was also really pleased with the way theyve treated tv bronn jerome flynn has been such an awesome presence in the show i was weirdly relieved they ended with that moving handshake between him and tyrion tv bronns reasoning was just so reasonable as opposed to the more ruthless betraying bronn i seem to remember from the novel "

"906" "candylilacs" 2014-05-19 " i dont think so he would also likely be immediately trying to seduce you so then tossing the fooddrink off the table a clear space ellaria might join in though "
"907" "Clariana" 2014-05-19 " you could add littlefinger "
"908" "imperium3" 2014-05-19 " i think ned would indeed have had him executed in westeros especially the north slavery is a heinous crime but for jorah mormont being sent to the wall would be an even worse fate remember his father was lord commander and unlikely to be happy about his son and heir disgracing the family name speaking of which has jorah found out yet that his father is dead i guess that news will take a long time to travel "
"909" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-05-19 " characters and motivations change a bit here and there between books and series but yes she believes it and believes it utterly the only real difference between mel in the series and books is some of the more humanising moments have been left out for example telling cressen theres still time to spill the cup and avoid dying and keeping davos adapted out other son by her side because she thinks hell be safer near her and she believed davos had suffered enough after the death of his eldest son "

"911" "Macra Bill" 2014-05-19 " ive had a thought remember varys and oberyns chat last episode in the throne room where varys mentioned that having desire is a weakness could this relate to littlefinger the difference between the two schemers is that littlefinger has an overwhelming desire for catsansa might this be his undoing in the end and the reason why it will be varys to triumph "

"913" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-05-19 " the question ia surely who has he already bought off to let him get away with it hes not a man who moves until all the pieces are in place it may be that the lords of the vale are already in his pocket "
"914" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-19 " ive wondered too but clearly some of it is real  she seems to be able to predict the future at times she gave birth to the creepy shadow things and here are lord berics revivals by thoros as well i think there is clearly some sort of fire god but i rather wonder what is actually is  a demon of some kind and is it really trying to save people with a messiah figure in the person of stannis or is that all a ploy for some other evil demonic purpose i tend to think the later maybe even that it could be in league somehow with the power behind the walkers so what i wonder is to what degree melisandre is aware of whats really going on or if she is as much a tool as the rest "
"915" "whatorly" 2014-05-19 " nothing isnt better or worse than anything its just nothing i loved that scene brilliant "
"916" "Katheartsboo" 2014-05-19 " i think hes just trying to invent westerosi by himself i do play guess where lord littlefinger of the wandering accent is from this week though "

"920" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-05-19 " of course this being got its laced with malice oberyn doesnt give a shit about tyrion hes endured weeks of tyrion and cersei thinking they can manipulate him now hes starting his own enemies list first up gregor clegane then tywin "

"925" "Clariana" 2014-05-19 " grr is a pacifist he was a conscientious objector during the viet nam war it always struck me that ned executing that deserter and not really listening to what he had to say was hubris and the beginning of the end of his life "
"926" "zephirine" 2014-05-19 " i suppose melisandre does believe all that stuff i thought her little lesson about the potions and illusions was interesting showing how cynical she can be if necessary theres a touch of the littlefinger about her i keep expecting a scene where she reveals that she actually doesnt give a toss about the lord of light but just wants everything "
"927" "imperium3" 2014-05-19 " no petyr put me down youre making a serious mistake not as serious as yours "

"930" "AnnM1997" 2014-05-19 " i thought this episode was a little patchy i totally agree with sarah there has hardly been any wall this last two weeks and it was always part of the story that i found really interested the little clip this week was hardly worth their while i was thankful that there was no theon reek that storyline was becoming unrelenting also disappointed in the execution of the eyrie scenes the sansa and robyn scene especially  and agree with whomever said that lysa flight to death happened too quickly that said i have now gotten used to littlefingers accent and find him the most intriguing character i dont know when he is lying or what his path to an end game is head and shoulders above everyone else is all of tyrions scenes that one with bronn certainly seemed like a goodbye did bronn deliver shae up to the lannisters is that why he got his castle i loved seeing hot pie too "
"931" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-05-19 " disappointing monsters "
"932" "Aelfwine" 2014-05-19 " yes the snowcastle served as a pretext for the altercation with robin but i didnt really get the sense of what it meant to sansa alright the stark  winterfell musical theme meant my heartstrings were automatically tugged anyway but it was a bit disappointing "
"933" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-05-19 " best scene of this series for me as it touched on the real theme of the episodenbsp those who are expendable and those who are notnbsp the mountain was favored by his father at the expense of his brother the hound tywin is willing to sacrifice one son to bring the other back under his wing even oberyn as the second in line in dorne is sent to risk his life against all enemoes while his brother is protected at home although one suspects that unlike the others on the last hes quite happy with the lot hes been dealt in life "

"935" "theDorkKnight" 2014-05-19 " ive never heard that actor sound remotely as interesting as bane sounded he did get his neck punched proper quick by bane early on in tdkr though "
"936" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-19 " men look ridiculous naked from the waist down i dont know that i would go that far but is for sure a lot easier to err and end up making them seem clownish rather than attractive i found daarios backside not to my taste at all which might also be an issue  women seem to vary significantly more than men in their tastes and manbits are a little more out there as well  a shot of an erect penis is sort of the equivalent of a close interior view on a lady whereas a plain frontal shot of a lady seems to still leave quite a bit to the imagination ive done work as a model for figure drawing classes and it is really not uncomfortable but i would be hesitant if i were a man to do a scene with an erect penis which would seem to be necessary if it was a sexy scene "
"937" "Thulcandra" 2014-05-19 " i really rather loved that episode though i am now judging sansa hard for seeming to get into that creepy kiss peter dinklage could carry the proverbial broomstick to a good scene but gosh im happy he doesnt have to the escalating tragedy and desperation of tyrions situation this episode was finally alleviated by oberyn in a gorgeous climax i cannot wait two weeks for the epic fight where words can hurt as bad as swords sorry bit spoilery "

"942" "anon0ts" 2014-05-19 " i actually went and brought a pie after that ohh yeahhh "
"943" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-19 " ive been thinking about peoples complaints about danys story not getting to westeros but i wonder if that is a problem of expectation because from the beginning of the story weve accepted the initial suggestion that is what her story was about but what if it isnt maybe the main purpose of her story is something else or maybe there is more than one purpose i wonder if people dont miss it because they are too focused on what they assume is the end of her story maybe there is something else were meant to be taking from that part of the tale  it is certainly a contrast to the war of the five kings and there has been lots of stuff about the right of kingship from a totally different direction a fair bit of political maneuvering and it is increasingly affecting what people are doing in westeros "
"944" "Aelfwine" 2014-05-19 "  ah brienne pod and  surprise  hot pie really the one heartwarming bit about all the grim stuff and that loaf of bread did look much nicer interesting to see them heading out for the eyrie  i too liked the scene with selyse  nice to have more insight into her character and melisandres shame melisandre had to spend more than half the scene gratuitously naked grrr im not sure im terribly reassured by the thought of the lord of light needing shireen  i was oddly moved by the hounds moment then by oberyns story its funny  i do remember the passage from the book but not being especially touched by it but here tyrions reaction and the way oberyn told it i suppose remembering elia was really moving  and finally the eyrie stuff i agree about littlefinger lying to sansa about why he killed joffrey what do we do to those who hurt the ones we love well i think systematically lying to and manipulating the one you love into a war just might put you into the hurting the ones we love category as for lysa i was a bit miffed that the whole tansy subplot was left out i thought that made her less of a onedimensional insane villain still  maybe it was because i was thinking of that  i found there was something oddly pitiful about her jealousy and insecurities in those very last moments ah well out of the moon door she goes "

"948" "imperium3" 2014-05-19 " i dont understand how a lot of people seem to dislike littlefinger when his main hobbies are awesome dialogue and killing off characters that nobody likes "

"950" "Konstantin Richter" 2014-05-19 " its a decent show and has fantastic acting and sets personally i find the multiple strains of narrative that progress by 45 minutes per episode challenging and unsatisfying "
"951" "SomeRandomPerson" 2014-05-19 " as much as i love his smarmy character im constantly guessing the different accents he seems to be juggling from english irish with a hint of spanish waiter thrown in "

"955" "DiamondDag" 2014-05-19 " haha yeah "
"956" "BonkIfYouHonk" 2014-05-19 " not as good as lord peter giving psychobitch the boot and he went a little bit oirish at the end there so he did "
"957" "DiamondDag" 2014-05-19 " i think the wandering accent being intentional might be a stretch but other than that hes been great to watch this season "
"958" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-19 " i dont so much mind his accent but sometimes he goes all hoarse sounding which i find a bit of a distraction "
"959" "keef1980" 2014-05-19 " on the mountain scene  i mentioned it last week on the blogs but its only been my attempts to work out who he is so i can keep track that let me know which actor was actually playing the mountain so i think it was probably needed as a reminder for the viewers who dont read catch up blogs or get a bit geeky about things i agree though it was a bit silly "
"960" "YoothaJoyce" 2014-05-19 " im going to treat myself to a post viewing read of the comments in a moment but did anyone else think that baelish creeping around in the snowy wonderland of the eyrie was a bit like a creepy mr tumnusprobably just me thenpops off to oil the hinges on the moon door "
"961" "fozziebearish" 2014-05-19 " i didnt mind the mountain scene  hes barely featured since season 1 and it was good to have a reminder and hear him talk i thought i detected a few lord of the rings style camera tricks to make him look taller than he is though it was timely for the hound to discuss his brutal sadism as well "
"962" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-05-19 " do the boobs outnumber the shirtless men besides aesthetically women are far more attractive naked men look ridiculous naked from the waist down "
"963" "RWizzle" 2014-05-19 " nobody cares say something interesting or go away "
"964" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-19 " i really really hated the opening bits with the mountain going after the peasants it seemed pretty unlikely even in the context of westeros maybe if hed been at his own place where he could keep it quiet or in the cities across the sea where there is slavery but not in the open in kings landing and i didnt find it succeeded in making him seem scarier or even as awful morally as some of the stories about him in the book do  it was a let down i also had mixed feelings about the scene with sansa i didnt find myself convinced about the part with robin or the slap he was stupid breaking the castle but it kind of seemed like an accident at first and even when he bowled it over slapping him was a bit much she didnt seem that angry either on the other hand i found the bit with petyr interesting  he was clearly lying about killing joffery for cat though sansa may have bought it i couldnt decide i thought the scene with arya and the hound was very touching  she seems to have finally really forgiven him i liked the touch of having him finally open up the first time we see him without his armour on i think rory mccann gets too little credit in that role as far as the question of heavyhanded foreshadowing  watching it i was thinking it might be foreshadowing for arya in a totally different direction as well poor tyrion  it seems that being a lannister destroyed all the real possibilities for friendship he thought he had he is sort of a stuckinbetween person dany has crappy taste in men and although i support a redress in the malefemale nudity balance i cant say i was happy to have to look at daarios arse he has pretty bad taste in flowers too "
"965" "quintssharktours" 2014-05-19 " woah we had some eerily similar reactions "
"966" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-05-19 " i felt sorry for viserys so i understand but consider what she actually did poisoned jon arryn and so indirectly killed off ned catelyn robb and the northern army possibly edmure and blackfish too as we dont know whats happened to them yet think she pretty much deserved what she got "
"967" "quintssharktours" 2014-05-19 " the scene near the beginning with the mountain made me chuckle reminded me of bolo in enter the dragon got seriously emotional during oberyns scene with tyrion and i shouted can you fly you sucker when lysa went bye bye it will be a long two weeks "
"968" "DiamondDag" 2014-05-19 " the scene where the mountain slaughters random people has to be one of the most laughably stupid things ive seen on this show i guess it served a purpose at least that conversation between oberyn and tyrion though shivers fantastic from both actors "
