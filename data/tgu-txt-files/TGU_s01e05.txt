"3" "Joemanji" 2011-05-23 " hmm waiting for the episode 6 blog now how lame is that  "
"4" "suziebee" 2011-05-21 " i absolutely bloody love this and havent read the booksim tempted but books are always better so dont want to spoil the progcant see myself waiting 5 years or so though there are a lot of characters but like with the wire im using the hbo website to help me remember who they all i actually like the scenes across the narrow sea viserys is obviously a right nutter and the dothraki are great having said that i like all the scenes and characters although was v disturbed by lysa obv the kids are great too which is q unusual winter is coming love it "
"5" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-20 " pillowhead there are 10 epsiodes in this series "
"6" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-20 " can anyone confirm how many episodes there will be in this season "
"7" "bananaballs" 2011-05-20 " remember they guard the wall their upbringing constantly reminds them that there are more dangerous things in the world than dothraki screamers mad kings and scheming lannisters dangers that you can only survive by sticking together by helping each other they dont guard the wall directly that is the nights watch who are independent of the houses as the northernmost kingdom the stark lands would be the first in line if the wall was breached "
"8" "shakera1611" 2011-05-19 " my favourite episode by far although i havent read the books and all the backstories were good to know they were also painfully boring the general feel thus far had been a bit like a waiting game and even the exciting endings at each episode annoyed rather than thrilled me but finally everything seems to be unfolding  and quickly too i was genuinely gutted that i couldnt skip straight to the next episode and not lose the momentum the characters have all been brilliant but the one i find most intriguing seems to be jaime in the last few episodes he talked a lot trying to connect to the audience to show a different side to him but it didnt really work but that one look and punch he threw at the soldier who disrupted his fight with ned showed much more its safe to say im hooked im desperate to read the books to see if any of the wild theories i have could prove to be correct theory of the day being that robert and neds sister are actually jon snows parents but that will have to wait until after exams "
"9" "Werthead" 2011-05-19 " so the mad king was the tangerines father ok and the lannisters father is yet to make his entrance the mad king was the father of viserys and daenerys yes they were evacuated from kings landing during roberts rebellion so avoided being killed jaime cersei and tyrions father tywin hasnt appeared yet no though hes been mentioned a fair bit "
"10" "HN1C" 2011-05-19 " so the mad king was the tangerines father ok and the lannisters father is yet to make his entrance interesting i think neds shock at the orders werent necessarily at the order itself but that it was being given by someone he thought he knew inside out it was a sad i dont know you anymore sort of reaction from ned everything he thought he knew is being torn down "
"11" "Vestrit7" 2011-05-19 " i think this is central the thing that everyone in kings landing has forgotten that the starks never do winter is coming all else is unimportant in comparison that actually just sent a chill down my spine "
"12" "JohnDear" 2011-05-19 " perhaps his older brother brandon would have been more street smart maybe but i get the feeling the starks just arent that duplicitous remember they guard the wall their upbringing constantly reminds them that there are more dangerous things in the world than dothraki screamers mad kings and scheming lannisters dangers that you can only survive by sticking together by helping each other i think this is central the thing that everyone in kings landing has forgotten that the starks never do winter is coming all else is unimportant in comparison "
"13" "SirJimmy" 2011-05-19 " he’s spent his life running a ‘onefamily’ castle put like that i can understand why he could be naive despite being in power he has never had any competition also as cersei mentioned ned was groomed to follow perhaps his older brother brandon would have been more street smart "
"14" "Vestrit7" 2011-05-19 " sir jimmy i don’t think you’re necessarily wrong in stating that you see a discrepancy between ned’s disgust at killing dany and his other actions and words it’s a valid point i think to understand the discrepancy you need to look at ned’s views on life and honour and also his life experiences for a start he clearly believes killing is necessary sometimes but he has also been raised by the old ways which state that if you’re going to have someone killed do it yourself and do it facetoface and don’t hide behind an executioner that was his point to bran at the execution part of this is also about remembering what death is like up close that way you don’t become a tyrant who orders death easily the thought of sending an assassin or a poisoner to the job just comes across to him as utterly cowardly and dishonourable to ned while dany is a targaryean he doesn’t see her as a realistic threat so it’s not necessary to kill her why would you so utterly dishonour yourself to take her out unnecessarily it’s also about his disgust with robert they were best friends as teenagers and young men raised to be brothersinlaw until lyanna’s death and they went to war together to unseat a mad bloodthirsty tyrant in aerys now he sees robert as a drunken fat whoring shadow of his former self who would order the killing of a teenage girl out of paranoia that is the kind of thing aerys would and did do including having ned’s own father and brother killed horrifically remember jaime’s comments about the screaming… also and i promise not to do this again in the books dany is only 14 years old to ned she is a child and i have also wondered whether her proximity in age to sansa and arya also plays a part in his reaction as for his naivity – yes ned is very naive and you can see that he’s quite clearly overwhelmed by it all he’s spent his life running a ‘onefamily’ castle and has no experience in the convoluted politics spying backstabbing and gameplaying of king’s landing it’s utterly foreign and bewildering to him also remember he was raised to follow not lead and only heads the stark family because aerys killed his older brother so he wasn’t trained in diplomacy or politics as for trusting littlefinger cat told him to trust lf and ned would trust her word and takes people on face value that approach has always worked for him up until now and he is to put it unkindly a bit of a country bumpkin in the capital when lf and varys offer their bits of information i get the feeling ned’s just thankful for any assistance he can get "
"15" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-19 " sirjimmy  even more callous when you consider that the week before hed had a brief chat with jory about their time in battle together during which jory mentioned that he almost lost an eye "
"16" "SirJimmy" 2011-05-19 " sunburst gah im having a bad week i remember cat saying hes only a boy when ned was told about the rangers desertion i realise now she was referring to bran however i still maintain that ned was too flabbergasted at the idea of killing daenerys as unfair and harsh as this may sound her position as heir to the deposed king means she isnt an innocent party in this i seem to be the only one thinking this so i wont bring this up again to give some credit to the show i think the lannisters are the best thing in this series so far tyrion is great but im starting to take a liking to jaime the way he dispatched jory staring at ned as he left the knife in was especially callous "
"17" "Silgen" 2011-05-19 " sirjimmy ah i see thats what confused me as ive read the books i knew the watch deserter was in his midtwenties and ned can certainly not be said to execute him casually you see his face fall when hes told a watch deserter has been caught but ned is a man of duty and does what his duty demands no matter what he may feel about it "
"18" "HummDrumm" 2011-05-19 " i think the whole seed is strong thing is that all roberts bastards look like him yet his own son looks nothing like him this evidence is what jon would have put before robert and cercei had he not met an untimely demise "
"19" "JohnDear" 2011-05-19 " could he possibly turn against his father a the f word i wonder when we get to see him i get the feeling hes the most important character we havent met yet "
"20" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-18 " ive snapped and got the book as im going to be away for 2 weeks and will miss some episodes its a hefty tome and no mistake regarding the bastard son debate i may be being thick here but the only significance i can see is it may bugger up the old inheritance line or lead to counter claims to the throne added to the fact im convinced joffrey is not roberts child i assume that is why john arryn was killed still badly shaken by the lysa arryn scene decapitated horses and knives in the head i can cope with which probably says a lot more about me and modern culture than anything else i really sense that the whole eyrie scenario will not end wll though thinking more about tyrion he does love his family but he clearly doesnt have much time for joffrey and is sympathetic to the underdog i wonder how his roll is going to bear out as things unfurl could he possibly turn against his father "
"21" "Sunburst" 2011-05-18 " ive worded that badly i meant the child was executed for the crime of saving his own life there was no trial and ned had no qualms killing him what child the deserter in the first episode was a ranger of the nights watch a guy of 25 years or thereabouts saving his own life actually means desertion in this context thats punishable by death in a medieval realm like the seven kingdoms the guy confessed or at least we didnt see him deny it on screen ned did have qualms you could see it in his face but he had to do it if you pardon one deserter from the nights watch everyone will desert and the wall will be left completely unmanned  and that might not be wise "
"22" "HN1C" 2011-05-18 " in the books he certainly survived and he has an important role to play later on so i imagine hell pop up again can i politely but firmly remind you of the blogs request to avoid book spoilers "
"23" "JohnDear" 2011-05-18 " sirjimmy silgens not questioning neds reasons hes questioning when he killed a child the deserter at the beginning of the first episode was not 10 years old "
"24" "SirJimmy" 2011-05-18 " silgen ive worded that badly i meant the child was executed for the crime of saving his own life there was no trial and ned had no qualms killing him im not saying he should be comfortable about the prospect of having to kill a young lady and her unborn child but he surely must consider it as an option even as a last resort i find it hard to believe a person who has been in power for so long would dismiss it out of hand especially if it could lead to rebellion and more bloodshed with the case of ned being naive i think i have more an issue with how the mystery around arryn and his death is unfolding ned hasnt actually done any detective work here littlefinger and varys turn up at his doorstep and divulge information at various times for no apparent reason obviously both have there own agendas but the whole situation feels so contrived that im having difficulty in believing in neds actions "
"25" "JohnDear" 2011-05-18 " he was afterall as you say advocating dany and viserys assassination and jorah is evidently his little bird within the dothrakitaergaryen camp "
"26" "HN1C" 2011-05-18 " both ned and robert were wards of jon arryn when they were younger almost like a father to them iirc ahhhi think my problem with jon arryn is i havent seen him so i have trouble linking him up with whats going on i think i need a flashback to see jon boy in all his sepia tinted bastard hunting glory i also want to see the mad king hopefully played by gary busey "
"27" "EddieLarkin" 2011-05-18 " so him and varys are trying to engineer a scrap between tangerines and the king ah dam this is complexis varys manipulating him or is he collaborating with himdoes the illyaro want a war im guessing yes is varys going behind his back and grassing him to the king so varys is advocating killing the baby to nip it all in the bud and avoid the war harsh but if he is worried about the dothraki firm coming up then maybe its actually the best optionafter all the sole purpose of danys and tamer hassans nephew getting together was simply to raise an army to invade the kingdom it would appear that varys and illyrio are engineering the return of the targaryens although nothing is really clear with varys he was afterall as you say advocating dany and viserys assassination "
"28" "sorrison" 2011-05-18 " so jon arran was going round on a bastardhunt whatever floats your boat mate and jon arran was neds sisters husbandso i guess thats why hes doing his investigationbut why bother so much about your sister in law if shes such a banshee she clearly doesnt care about finding who killed her husbandoh the intrigue both ned and robert were wards of jon arryn when they were younger almost like a father to them iirc "
"29" "Joemanji" 2011-05-18 " i think its fairly obvious even to non bookreader like myself the implications of jon arrans search and his last words what the mother of the baby girl said really hammered it home i think i dont know what the added significance of the book is other than perhaps it being a trait of previous generations wont spell out my suspicions as i dont know when it gets resolved in the books there have been hints here that certain things dont resolved until book 4 ive ordered the first five paperbacks from amazon hoping i can resist starting them at least until this series ends "
"30" "HN1C" 2011-05-18 " ah yes i kind of remember now i knew he was important and i was disappointed that i didnt know why now i probably need to go and watch the scene yet again to check what he is saying and why etc so him and varys are trying to engineer a scrap between tangerines and the king ah dam this is complexis varys manipulating him or is he collaborating with himdoes the illyaro want a war im guessing yes is varys going behind his back and grassing him to the king so varys is advocating killing the baby to nip it all in the bud and avoid the war harsh but if he is worried about the dothraki firm coming up then maybe its actually the best optionafter all the sole purpose of danys and tamer hassans nephew getting together was simply to raise an army to invade the kingdom "
"31" "EddieLarkin" 2011-05-18 " the bit where noballs was chatting in the dungeon to some random string puller that was actual illyrio from the opening episode he was the dude from across the narrow sea who introduced viserys and dany to the dothraki and jon arran was neds sisters husband neds wifes sisters husband "
"32" "HN1C" 2011-05-18 " brilliant episode nonbook reader gets better with every week starting to wind up to full speed i think the bit where noballs was chatting in the dungeon to some random string puller i had to rewind like 4 times to catch all of the dialogue love it that i have to do that love it that its a struggle to remember who everyone is nothing wrong with a bit of complicated but yeah what is varys playing at whose side is he onor is he truly 100 realmorientated i think i believe him that he is not doing things for himself i was all sweaty standing up not even on the edge of my seat for the whole episode when that guy says to littlefinger still cant afford a freind eh i was sneering yeah littlefinger no one likes youprick when ned was arguing with robert i was like ned what u going hes gonna kill you come to your senses for gods sake man when ned got speared in the hamstring i sunk to my knees and let out a guttral whimper arms outstretched willem defoe style i think im a bit too involved in this series so jon arran was going round on a bastardhunt whatever floats your boat mate and jon arran was neds sisters husbandso i guess thats why hes doing his investigationbut why bother so much about your sister in law if shes such a banshee she clearly doesnt care about finding who killed her husbandoh the intrigue oh yeah and great horse execution loing the king roberts performance getting more red and shiny by the weeks get yr gout on "
"33" "TAFKAJamie" 2011-05-18 " mrsmcg i am alas guilty of having read the books but i dont see the tv series as anything like a readalong tape there have been substantive additions to the original material and the very nature of the tv medium means that agot the show  where there is one pov the cameras  simply cannot parrot the multiple povs and unreliable narrators of the books for me that adds a whole new level of depth to the story seeing characters as they really are or at least seeing them in the way that one presumes the outside worldwithintheshow must see them "
"34" "MrsMcG" 2011-05-18 " must agree with thebigkahuna in that most of the comments here seem to be from people who have read the book which must be a bit like a readalong tape we used to have when we were kids as a non book reader i am only now starting to get to grips with who people are and what their connections are so i think ive missed some of the subtleties in the characters in particular a lot of the perifery knights sons council members for example i see that what happened to jory was distrubing but i had only just clocked that he was neds right hand man and so didnt yet care too much about him having said that ned is obviously your commonorgarden good bloke hero arya is obviously going to have some sort of big role possibly saving her fathers life or the whole kingdom who knows i have no doubt that robert is going to come to some sort of sticky ending because hes not the sort of king anyone wants and we can only live in hope that joffrey will suffer something slow and painful somewhere along the way i would think the big storyline for next weeks is going to be uncovering all of roberts illigitemate children im interested to see what tyrion is going to do hes currently taking the wrap for his siblings behaviour but he has done the right thing in the past the sadle for bran will he save himself or will he stick with the peggy mitchell view of it being all about the faaaamily this episode has made me feel more engaged i think sticking to one location helped and i feel better equiped to sit back and enjoy the future episodes instead of racking my brains through half of the scenes to think about where i have seen these people before although i did miss jon snow this week "
"35" "JohnDear" 2011-05-18 " i dont think eddard necessarily trusts littlefinger its just littlefinger is very actively involving himself in eddards life and his investigation of jon arrys death were seeing those scenes "
"36" "Werthead" 2011-05-18 " i think that was a reference to will in the first episode since wills only crime was to save his own life which of course it wasnt he could have run back to the wall but instead deserted altogether though will was clearly in his mid to late 20s and not a 10yearold at all eddard knows what a nest of vipers the court is but has basically chosen to side with and trust littlefinger relying on littlefingers lingering affection for his wife and unwillingness to hurt her to ensure they have continued mutual interests its a little bit thin to be honest and relies on the fact that littlefingers contnued friendship for cat isnt itself a ploy or strategem but eddard probably figures its his best shot and since we know now that varys and illyrio are conspiring to put the targaryens back in power it may well be the right choice "
"37" "Sunburst" 2011-05-17 " ahem surely he must suspect he is being manipulated of course he does ned is naive  he assumes everyone in kings landing play by the same rules they do in tnorth ahem no and no whats wrong with you people he knows perfectly well that people of the court are duplicitous and dangerous hed be a total idiot if he thought that cersei littlefinger and varys play by the same rules as they do in the north hes trying to resolve things by sticking to his moral code hes not naive or stupid  he just doesnt have it in him to be devious and to skulk behind the scenes hatching plots and intrigues to get his way "
"38" "Sunburst" 2011-05-17 " i dont remember it either when did ned stark kill a 10yearold  he sure is being a bit squeamish about wacking daenerys and her unborn child quite rightly so because killing a 17yearold girl and her unborn child would be an extremely dishonourable thing to do and since ned stark lives by his code of honour his views on the subject are more than logical whatever happened to the i was trained to kill my enemies schtick an enemy of a great knightlord is another great knightlord not a pregnant adolescent girl located half a world away who might or might not arrive with an army that at present has no ships intensely dislikes the sea and at the moment is not moving in the direction of the seven kingdoms at all imagine that secondly he seems to take everybodys word at face value without question no he doesnt surely he must suspect he is being manipulatedblockquote of course he does ned is naive  he assumes everyone in kings landing play by the same rules they do in tnorth ahem no and no whats wrong with you people he knows perfectly well that people of the court are duplicitous and dangerous hed be a total idiot if he thought that cersei littlefinger and varys play by the same rules as they do in the north hes trying to resolve things by sticking to his moral code hes not naive or stupid  he just doesnt have it in him to be devious and to skulk behind the scenes hatching plots and intrigues to get his way "
"39" "Silgen" 2011-05-17 " sir jimmy for a person who didnt hesitate in chopping a ten year olds head off for essentially saving his own life remind me of the occasion when ned chopped the head of a tenyearold off one who had saved his life i mustnt have been paying attention because i dont remember it "
"40" "macster" 2011-05-17 " sirjimmy ned is naive  he assumes everyone in kings landing play by the same rules they do in tnorth and the starks have famously slow minds the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword  of course he feels hiring assassins is unworthy of the king and that you shouldnt be murdering children "
"41" "smilerone" 2011-05-17 " i found the breast feeding scene more uncomortable to watch than any of the violent scenes unfortunately probably says more about me than anything else "
"42" "hendero67" 2011-05-17 " tafkajamie and eddielarkin  thanks with a name like marillion of course hes a musical genius "
"43" "SirJimmy" 2011-05-17 " im having serious reservations about how ned is being portrayed in this series i feel he is coming across too naive and bordering on the stupid for a person who didnt hesitate in chopping a ten year olds head off for essentially saving his own life he sure is being a bit squeamish about wacking daenerys and her unborn child although its excessive i find it difficult to believe he would be so morally upright about it whatever happened to the i was trained to kill my enemies schtick secondly he seems to take everybodys word at face value without question varys conveniently implicates hugh only after the knight dies and littlefinger keeps popping up with bits of information regarding jon arryn without any reason surely he must suspect he is being manipulated "
"44" "TAFKAJamie" 2011-05-17 " hendero67 apparently he can be glimpsed catching up as the eyriebound group leave after the hill tribe attack and benioff  weiss have confirmed elsewhere that marillion was not killed in the episode "
"45" "EddieLarkin" 2011-05-17 " in the books he certainly survived and he has an important role to play later on so i imagine hell pop up again "
"46" "hendero67" 2011-05-17 " the minstrel in lady starks travelling party reminded me more than a little of a similar character in monty python and the holy grail did he survive the ambush i would love to see him again now that theyve been to the eyrie singing something along the lines of his house is like an eagles nesthes still nursing at his mothers breastbrave brave ser robin "
"47" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-17 " sunburst i thought they slightly overplayed the bitchiness it teetered on stereotype although like you i enjoyed renlys knight of the flowers comment smilerone thats what i have to do for my husband who is that person but why what was that motto again hang on is she really breastfeeding an eight year old actually i find its good fun watching with someone who has no idea whats going to happen its made it a very different viewing experience "
"48" "smilerone" 2011-05-17 " very enjoyable dante 24its the opposite in our house i have to pause the show to ask my wife who is that person have now printed off the hbo guide to houses "
"49" "Sunburst" 2011-05-17 " i have to say all these discussions over dvd sales costbenefit analyses and the possible format of the fifth sixth and seventh season are extremely dull enjoy season one for heavens sake anyway i absolutely loved robert and cerseis scene mark addy and lena headey are doing a wonderful job as are the writers with giving cersei more nuance and depth shes become my favourite character and i always loathed her also hilariously on another forum there have been some protestations about the man love from people who have read the books and didnt pick up on the knight of the flowers and all of the ribbald comments made about him  to renly amazing  how can you not pick up on that true it was done very subtly in the books but after a while it became rather obvious interesting scene one has to wonder though why arent they just lying in bed together why the chestshaving  and maybe the actors overdid it slightly with extra bitchiness although it was a bit funny when renly says oh i am not tough enough look whos talking the knight of flowers oh yes and varys  littlefinger duet brilliant you know i have no idea where my balls are and to think we used to be so close "
"50" "Dante24" 2011-05-17 " cracking episode my wife has stopped paying attention though i have to keep on explaining who is who  i fear she will give up soon "
"51" "EddieLarkin" 2011-05-17 " having not read the books i have to say the wife and i are still struggling slightly with remembering certain character names and connections it seems that character names are dropped andor plot lines are introduced without very much explanation fine if you have read the books but not so easy to follow for noobs like ushope we are not alone here i suggest using hbos spoiler free viewing guide to help with anything like this httpviewersguidehbocomgameofthrones it goes into detail about the characters their relationships to the other characters and the history of the world and past events such as roberts rebellion "
"52" "planjp" 2011-05-17 " thebigkahuna cant say about the tv series as i am waiting for the dvd no tv but i am on my second reading of the book started again as soon as i finished it and it makes a lot more sense the second time through now i have a better idea of who on earth everyone is jx "
"53" "TheBigKahuna" 2011-05-17 " great episode definately the best one so far this im not ashamed to say is partly due to the pretty bad ass blood and gore scenes cant wait to find out more about the wall and what lurks behind it having not read the books i have to say the wife and i are still struggling slightly with remembering certain character names and connections it seems that character names are dropped andor plot lines are introduced without very much explanation fine if you have read the books but not so easy to follow for noobs like ushope we are not alone here "
"54" "MoreTears" 2011-05-17 " smartymcfly are you in the uk or us the uk and us dvd markets are pretty different uk dvds drop in price pretty quickly in north america it is not that way at all apart from a specific sale a dvd box set can the same in price in america pretty much forever  or increase "
"55" "Sam13" 2011-05-17 " i am massively enjoying the series i think the adaption from the books is very well done  although its been a few years since ive read them so maybe my hazy memory is a good thing in that regard this week’s episode was definitely my favourite so far  and cant wait for the rest of the series i liked the part after the joust when loras held up the hounds arm it really gave the impression of his massive stature which in turn was paltry compared to the mountain when they were dancing i dont think mr forel would be happy with me by calling that dancing i also have to agree with others that comments and speculation from fresh eyed viewers that havent read the novels is very enjoyable to read  so please keep commenting "
"56" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-17 " moretears i dont doubt that the sales will be strong im just not sure on the earnings for hbo from that once costs marketing distribution etc are factored in that and the fact that budget distribution outlets drop prices pretty quickly it may well still be a really good earner its just that im not sure i know films dont earn as much as people think from dvd and certainly music dvds are the same maybe someone with more knowledge than i can provide more detailed info  i know the guardian boards are frequented by media folks  "
"57" "MoreTears" 2011-05-17 " smartymcfly dvd box sets are a huge cash cow for hbo the number of americans interested in hbo series far exceeds the number of people who actually subscribe to the channel it helps too that the dvds are more expensive than the box sets for a lot of other shows of similar length "
"58" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-17 " i think other than the economics the other factor will be interest in the series even if the producers manage to keep the tension and story moving viewers do tend to get bored of series at some point something like 24 for eg viewers dropped pretty significantly over the series at least beyond the first 3 dvd sales can be overemphasised im not sure how much profit is in them for hbo after all the margins are taken into consideration  obviously sales should be good which  but it may not be the cashcow that some suggest the big earner so far has been oversea sales for hbo it broke their records although that is partly explained by exchange rates if these overseas sales remain strong then i think the series will be continued "
"59" "JohnElway" 2011-05-17 " misswestcalifornia sorry ending after book 3 would be a disaster way too many plotlines  characters stories still left hanging youre not wrong on a feast for crows but i think in some respects that rather meandering book actually is a window of opportunity for the shows writers they could use some of season 4s allocated time to flesh out stories that had been pruned from books 2  3 due to time constraints they could also run the stories from dance concurrently with the stories from feast after all the two books are supposed to be in parallel timelines not consecutive that way season 5 could conclude both feast  dance a rather speculative post from me though sorry "
"60" "avidfan" 2011-05-17 " wow really thrilling episode packed with great moments nice to see a few more exterior shots of the red keep one of my gripes from previous episodes has been the lack of many big shots of king’s landing – budget constraints i suppose not sure about renly’s sexuality… and for someone who’s supposed to be the commoner’s choice the guy they’ve got playing him is a bit less dashing and magnetic than i was hoping slightly disappointed by the eerie though – i was expecting a big build up to this and something really breathtaking  recently reread the first book and one of my highlights was the great journey up to the eerie along narrow paths next to sheer drops etc however the eerie itself looked a bit funny – like a wedding cake stuck on top of a mound i’d always thought it was a much more vertical structure – like thin spires reaching into the sky and clinging to the side of the mountain oh and honourable mention for mark addy – thought he was particularly greta trying to fit the armour on and tying the poor lannister kid in knots  "
"61" "EddieLarkin" 2011-05-17 " the show could sensibly end at the conclusion of book 3 after four seasons since thats at least a point of inflection in the ploti cant really argue the case for that in story terms without spoilers but if you think how uneventful book 4 is with its succession of meandering and pointless journeys and arbirary recomplications then its hard hard to believe that an adaptation of it would make rivetting television anyway the show makers have said something along the lines of that if they did get as far as adapting book 4 and 5 they would be done so chronologically ie the story wouldnt be split between characters like it is in the books assuming dance is a lot more exciting than feast this would solve that problem and although i agree that the third book has a natural sort of stop point i really dont think audiences would accept the story ending there a lot of stuff is wrapped up but much more tantalising threads are begun "
"62" "Werthead" 2011-05-17 " generally hbo programmes have been cancelled for one of two reasons 1 cost carnivale and rome were both canned due to budget concerns rome prematurely as hbo have indicated since then got somewhat overcomes this because its 5060m budget is modest when compared to hbos most expensive shows though still high compared to network most importantly hbo have made back 50 of the shows cost in foreign sales since those deals are multiyear hbo themselves are effectively only spending 2530m per season out of their own pocket about the same as true blood assuming even moderately strong dvd sales the show will turn a profit pretty easily 2 producers leaving david milch quitting deadwood to do john from cincinatti led to deadwoods cancellation david simon felt hed said everything that needed to be said after season 5 of the wire the sopranos ended due to its producer deciding that the story ended there all three shows were dependent on their producers and showrunners thrones isnt if david benioff left to do something else someone else could come on board to take over pretty straightforwardly therefore i cant help but wonder whether im getting into a series which will never be finished leaving me unsatisfied and pissed off when its inevitably cancelled has this been bothering anyone else in this case the books will still be there and will take the story forward so if you become heavilyinvested in the tv show and it is then cancelled you can still find out what happens next "
"63" "MissWestCarolina" 2011-05-17 " the show could sensibly end at the conclusion of book 3 after four seasons since thats at least a point of inflection in the plot i cant really argue the case for that in story terms without spoilers but if you think how uneventful book 4 is with its succession of meandering and pointless journeys and arbirary recomplications then its hard hard to believe that an adaptation of it would make rivetting television anyway "
"64" "Bella79" 2011-05-17 " very surprised no one has mentioned it yet and i wont spoil it but did no one else figure out what the implications of roberts bastard children and the big book of lineages means "
"65" "JohnElway" 2011-05-17 " im not buying the argument that hbo wont support the show through to 7 possibly more seasons so long as the show is getting solid ratings  generating dvd sales then hbo wins by having the show last many seasons there is no hbo rule that says how long a show should last the ratings  profits will decide hbo after all is a commercial operation great hbo shows of the past wire sfu  sopranos for example lasted for 5 seaons because the writers had written all they wanted to say grrm still clearly has a lot to write too much arguably the more important question is can they mantain the high quality writing to ensure the audience stays with the show the answer to that lies several years down the road "
"66" "vk1980" 2011-05-17 " ericbforpm great episode mind i was nervous to see what awaited tyrion in the cell visually the missing wall was a great choice that was one of the most vivid images conjured by the book for me in the eyrie the sky cells are open to the elements and have sloping floorsprisoners darent sleep lest they start rollingand the jailer taunts them about flying agree with other posters and i have posted similar on previous weeks blog that there is more explicit exposition in the tv show whereas the book is more implict  such as the conversation overheard by arya the relationship between renly and loras that is the nature of the different mediums though and theres probably still enough that is going under the non readers radar to give genuine surpriseshilariously on another forum there have been some protestations about the man love from people who have read the books and didnt pick up on the kinght of the flowers and all of the ribbald comments made about him  to renly doh "
"67" "MoreTears" 2011-05-17 " eddielarkin indeed sales of dvd box sets will be key hbo cancelled rome after two seasons because of the series astronomical costs but i have heard that years later an hbo executive said that the costbenefit analysis that led to cancelling rome underestimated the amount of money the dvd sales would generate and in retrospect ending the show early cost them a lot of revenue that would have more than covered costs of producing further seasons i would like to think that it is with this sort of thing in mind that hbo undertook the games of thrones project "
"68" "EddieLarkin" 2011-05-17 " if the series ending without a proper conclusion would bother you so much surely it would be enough to motivate you to buy the books although it is a little hard to swallow the idea that hbo will invest themselves for 8 or 9 years i dont think it is impossible what is most important is that this series makes them money they will suffer a huge backlash from book fans and hopefully non books fans if they cancelled a story this rich half way through and so will surely look for every reason to keep it on the air the viewing figures are doing okay but what is most important is dvdbd and merchandise sales if you want to support the future of the show start saving now for the boxset next year maybe 2 or 3 boxsets for birthdayxmas presents  also head over to httpstorehboukcomvhboukshowsgameofthronesnvbarheroflashunitshowsgameofthrones for all your merchandise needs tshirts mugs jewelry etc "
"69" "FormicaAtomica" 2011-05-17 " enjoyed it i wanted ned to shout jory but im just being picky i know they want to beef up the show but ned and jaime never actually fought trust me those who havent read the books would have hated jaime more for the way he just casually ordered the men to be killed and didnt even wait to gloat added to his villainy "
"70" "MoreTears" 2011-05-17 " uninventivename a friend of mine was expressing sentiments similar to yours just a couple of weeks ago he doesnt see hbo wanting to stick with this series longer than four or five years but unlike you he doesnt think the show will end unfinished as much as an ending will be manufactured by the show producers that has nothing to do with martins book series  which book series may not even be finished by the time hbo wants the show over my friend could be right you could be right but i will tell you what i told my friend past hbo drama series not counting miniseries differ from this one because they werent closely following a book series narrative even true blood is only loosely based on a series of books the length of those series is meaningless because none of them ended with alreadypublished story left unadapted hbo knew what they were getting into when they undertook this project and i think they intended that they would see it through as long as certain audience size foreign sales and dvd sales expectations are being met "
"71" "JohnDear" 2011-05-17 " has this been bothering anyone else certainly ive not read the books but since this series began i read around the subject a bit i know that there are plot points being set up in the previous 4 episodes that still havent been resolved 4 books later its a terrific gamble by hbo and sky "
"72" "numsi1981" 2011-05-17 " absolutely loved it as many commentators point out the acting is absolutely spot on mark addy plays robert to perfection that constantly drunken heavybreathing laugh is marvelous from a storytelling viewpoint it just worked perfectly to concentrate on the story plots in kings landing and the tyrioncatelyn one diamonddag i have to agree with smartymcfly that this the robertcersei scence is not about telling us over and over again about a failed political marriage but it is about character development and giving the viewers some important anchors in the show there were like 10 moments of the episode like the where are your balls dig of littlefinger aryas scene with the guards the fight between jaime and ned yes these guys wear heavy armor and lift heavy swords so they dont move around like ballet dancers and the glimpse of hope in brans face when he learned that he might be able to shoot the bow from a horseback yet the winner can only be the complete awkwardness in the whole lysa arryn scene tyrions expression was absolutely priceless and i wonder why catelyn didnt beg her sis to stop that shit i can only hope this was a plastic boob otherwise the child actor will have a trauma for life which i certainly do an almost equal what the f moment was the mountain chopping off his horses head man what a bad loser hope hbo checked the episodes with some animal rights and child abuse institutions p i cant hardly wait for next week and from what we can hear from book readers the show wont slow down for quite a bit by the way i completely agree with the more wolves less boobs comment the wolves are just cool and boobs are completely spoiled for me since that lysa scene "
"73" "DrQuinzel" 2011-05-17 " i missed all of the subtle jamie lannister acting in that final scene because i had my hands over my face yelling dont you dare kill ned hes my favourite of course half an episode earlier id been yelling the same thing about tyrion im honoured to have my suggestion of brit of the week added to the blog democracy in action something king robert clearly knows little about having said that i really felt this was mark addys episode he was excellent at portraying all the conflicting sides of the king from jokey cammeraderie to spoilt hissy fits hes obviously become a far more dangerous and unpredictable person than he was when ned last knew him a fact that ned has slowly realised across the course of the series this week ive also been mostly enjoyingthe shifting relationship between catelyn and tyrion as she goes from vengeanceseeking mother to seemingly his unlikely protectortyrion killing someone with a shield leading to yet another discussion on first killsned taking the blame with jamie for catelyns actionsthe brilliant battle of smarm between littlefinger and varysaryas indignation at repeatedly being mistaken for a boy "
"74" "RedWedgewood" 2011-05-17 " very gripping series despite the fact that its little more than xenaconan with much better actors "
"75" "UninventiveName" 2011-05-17 " this was a great episode which i thoroughly enjoyed it felt like a lot of the admittedly engaging intrigue and backstory of the last 4 episodes finally had a payoff however the more i get into this series the more i wonder to myself are we ever going to see it finished i cant really see how thats going to happen for a start lets say that each book is condensed into 1 season thats still 7 seasons of a show thats supposed to be costing around 50mil a season add to that the fact that george rr martin seems to be the slowest writer on the planet and you wonder whether therell be a 4 year gap between the 5th and 6th seasons or the 6th and 7th seasons i read an interview with george rr martin recently and he said that he thinks a couple of the later books none of which ive read by the way will not be able to be fit into 1 season saying that books like storm of swords will need 2 seasons so he evidently thinks the only way to do it justice is to make at least 9 or 10 seasons of it given that its exceptional for an hbo series to last longer than 5 seasons this seems incredibly unlikely gots viewing figures seems to be strong so far but not to the extent that its a flagship programme for hbo i know they have a good track record for persevering with series until the story is finished but surely theres no way theyll go for 9 seasons of game of thrones even if the viewing figures were exceptional 7 alone is pushing it therefore i cant help but wonder whether im getting into a series which will never be finished leaving me unsatisfied and pissed off when its inevitably cancelled has this been bothering anyone else "
"76" "Bella79" 2011-05-17 " wonderful episode and nice to see a change of pace and focus on just one or two story lines  as much as i think jon and the wall are my favourites i was more than happy to not see him for a week when the kings landing storyline was so cracking moment of the episode though had to be a very brief shot of tyrions whatthefck face when confronted with the breastfeeding lysa "

"82" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-17 " a quick post as im in the middle of house movement so having internet issues but one thing i also meant to comment on in the blog was the final scene with jaime  i thought it did a very clever job of showing us that this is a man who isnt that bothered by throwing children off walls sleeping with his sister or killing the old king but who really hates the idea that he didnt beat a man on his own merit its an interesting trait and costerwaldeau sold it completely i agree with the idea that written in scenes are some of the best although im not entirely convinced by the renly loras scene mainly for the same reasons as diamonddag in that loras hasnt really convinced me yet although he did make me think of piers gaveston whose battle prowess is often ignored in favour of the whole kings minion thing joemanji  cut and paste and technology in general is never my friend sadly "
"83" "Moryu" 2011-05-17 " in agreement with most people here fantastic episode the robert and cersei scene was brilliantly done roll on next week "
"84" "wellyeahokbut" 2011-05-17 " speaking as a pedantic book person i actually think the added scenes are some of the best its good that the writers have the confidence to flesh out the povs of robert cersei renly loras varys etc and its a relief that the superb cast have finally reached the point of not having to start every line with well speaking as your brotherwifehostagefriendly neighbourhood infodump   keeping the action focussed to mostly the south worked well in the short term ill be interested to see whether they keep that level of focus in future still feel like i could just be one episode away from losing myself completely in it "
"85" "quipu" 2011-05-17 " nothing much to add other than total agreement with almost everyone the shows really hit its stride here and you can feel the writers confidence seeping into the writing the departures from the novels really helped deepen the story and that scene between robert and cersei was as good as anything that was ever in the novels in my opinion mark addy is totally owning his performance and lena headey deserves credit for giving cersei so much more depth than was apparent in the books wow with a dance with dragons coming out in june it really is a good time to be a song of ice and fire fan "
"86" "DiamondDag" 2011-05-17 " conleth hill is indeed playing varys to perfection it really is the strength of this show that they have so many strong performances the exchange of threats between varys and littlefinger was brilliant ive seen other comments of people saying they are disappointed by aidan gillen but he seems to be doing fine with the part in my eyes talking of thesps i know hes yet to appear but charles dance cant wait "
"87" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-16 " diamonddag i know others have pointed out the same concerns re theonros and cerseirobert for me cersie  robert may be slightly superfluous in terms of plot but man it was all about the character i loved the scene because it stripped away some of the layers from both of them and their relationship and consequently added some depth the story needs some anchor points like that and these people need some underlying complexity and structure to hang all the plot together another aspect to this weeks episode was duels you had the obvious cersei vs robert ned vs jaime sandor clegane vs gregor clegane and littlefinger vs varys but there are also some more subtle ones in there catelyn vs tyrion its not obvious from the show how this will play outbran vs robin sons of tullys catelyn and lysa  both broken if you can call being sickly and overly mothered being broken and of course  arya vs cat "

"90" "DiamondDag" 2011-05-16 " blimey im going to seem like a right grump after all this praise still enjoying the show for certain its just in the last two episodes it feels like the added scenes are starting to get in the way and clutter things up a bit sometimes they are great such as varys and littlefinger and then others i just cant fathom like theon with the whore it just seemed to add nothing to what we know of theon and took time away from other areas some might disagree but i also thought the conversation between robert and cersei was a bit redundant yes we get it robert loved lyanna and its a political marriage loras and renly was a strange one because while i liked the extra insight into renlys thinking i couldnt help be irritated by the silly casting of loras this is a guy that has being swinging swords since he was a boy and jousting in full armour but looks like hed blow away in a strong wind i mean come on ive got more muscle than that and the most exercise i have is lifting a mug of tea i really hesitate to say this because i trust the writers but is his scrawny nature to make him more effeminate all in all enjoyable loved seeing bronn in action the dragon skulls and that conversation plus poor jory just i dont know a bit less pointless whoring and maybe more of the lovely direwolves please dont set them up as important omens in the first episode then ignore one of the most important ones this fan would like more ghost please wanting more wolf action than boobs im so confused "

"93" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-16 " loved it great episode i agree with the comments above the focus on kings landing and the vale with a sprinkling of winterfell helped concentrate the action great to finally see bronn jeromme flynn following last weeks brief appearance im only going to mention something vaguely here im a book reader  but it is interesting how they treated a certain scene which the book is only vague about not talking about renly  loras  its more explicit than the book in identifying at least one of the conspirators talking in the dungeons it makes me wonder whether grrm had any input there so many iconic scenes in this episode would love to see what nonreaders make of it "
"94" "Spacedone" 2011-05-16 " good episode things start getting interesting from here on in "
"95" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-16 " holy crap that was a cracking episode from start to finish my instant reaction is i need to watch it again to take everything in initial observations though the scene with robert and cersei stood out for me interesting to see them speak so openly i agree with sarah hughes its hard to know what to make of her whether its all an act the fact she mentioned the death of her first child again quashes the doubts around what she said to catelyn and that it was probably sincere but then what all the rest of episode highlights most obviously when discussing murdering dany is that unfortunately you cant let your emotions or morals get in the way of real politik the impression i got was that she knows right now which side her bread is buttered and sticking with robert makes most sense although i remain convinced she is playing the long con to put joffrey on the throne secondly lysa oh my word tyrion wasnt joking was he with the greatest of respect to the moderators that was some messed up shit right there shes obviously as mad as a bag of badgers from the moment last week where she arrested him i thought that it was a really stupid thing to do and every decision she has made since then has confirmed this both her and ned are in unfamiliar territory now with very few friends and probably a whole load of problems mounting up the starks continually act in a manner that is honourable and morally superior and it looks like it is going to continually shoot or spear more aptly them in the foot young theon looks like he may well fall into this category soon enough as well loved the open wall cell they put tyrion in though varys is a creepy bugger isnt he between him and littlefinger i have no idea who is on what side and wants what but it is brilliant to watch their little battle of words was a brilliantly executed scene and contrasted nicely with what was to come at the end theirs is a war of intrigue and information rather than swords and i suspect what will be interesting in the long run is what is more important as robert and ned for starters are rubbish at the intigue finally the battle at the end jaime has a lot in common with robert in that he loves fighting and nothing more than a good war as seen last week when talking to jory who he fought alongside previously unfortunately that counted for very little this week as he stabbed him in the head which was a bit sad as id grown to like jory although i guess we finally see the ambiguity people have been promising the relish on his face as he fought ned was excellent as was when he knocked out his own man for spearing him along with what cersei said it is clear to me he is not king material and not the end game of whatever plan the lannisters are playing he is a warrior pure and simple plenty to think about and we didnt even get any wall i cant wait for winter or across the sea action "
"96" "Lalwende" 2011-05-16 " i was waiting to post on here before the episode review was even up thats got to be the geeks equivalent of standing outside the pub door waiting for opening time anyway anyone who hasnt read the book this is where it kicks off so if you thought this was a gruesome episode better get the sick bucket ready for the rest of the series fab good things wasnt bronn excellent and the dragon skulls more character development for the hound varys and littlefinger and i like how theyre showing more to theons character plus lots of hints towards whats to come so that was an episode to watch closely im waiting for some protest from animal rights and probreast feeding groups the one thing i did not like here was the eyrie  good inside bad outside in my opinion as it was totally different to the image in my mind "
"97" "MerinoTeflonz" 2011-05-16 " i agree that everything did click this episode and i am starting to consider the hound one to watchtyrion is a bit like hugh lauries house or in his case bungalow which isnt a criticism just a crass observationaidan gillens contained performance is excellentvery involving episode all round "

"100" "Werthead" 2011-05-16 " after the clunky exposition fest last week this episode suddenly clicked together in a most satisfying manner we got great little character scenes between varys and littlefinger renly and loras and robert and cersei as well as the excellent youre too fat for your armour conversation between ned and robert we also got some pretty good action scenes though jaime and neds swordfight was perhaps undermined by us not seeing jaime take part in the hands tournament earlier on if wed seen jaime nonchalantly laying down the hurt already his prowess would have been better set up so wed share his surprise at ned a guy 1015 years his senior not only holding his own but even pressing him back costerwaldau did some excellent expression acting as jaime there going through surprise then a slight burst of worry at the thought that he may be about to die and then fury when someone else steps in and stabs ned from behind to the point where he lays out the man responsible ending the best fight hes had in years great work there also good to see tyrion getting involved in the action just because hes small that doesnt mean he cant be dangerous jerome flynn is also doing great work as bronn so far though i note that the writers didnt bother explaining why he was there or what his name was perhaps they figured that people would work out that bronn and the other knights from last week had volunteered to escort cat through the mountains other nice touches the opening title sequence shifting to include the eyrie for the first time the first mention of robert and renlys other brother stannis the guy with the personality of a lobster and wont it be fun seeing whos going to play him and maester luwin tutoring bran and contemptuously putting down theons pride donald sumpter doing terrific work with a small role there also good to see some redressing of the complaints over female nudity with alfie allen baring all guess his experience doing equus helped out there and us getting a gay scene that didnt leave much to the imagination i imagine the sound guys had fun coming up with the sound effects for the end of that scene renly and lorass relationship was handled very subtly in the books but to the point where lots of people missed out on it so hbo obviously decided they wanted to go in a different direction here and made it so obvious noone could mistake it for something else the only complaint i really have is that whilst the tv eyrie does look great its not quite as iconic as it was in the books with the monstrous ascent up the much taller mountain meeting a memorable guide and more and unfortunately the tv show seems to have dropped the character of brynden the blackfish at least for now sad as he was a memorable character but also necessary given how huge the cast has become by this point "

"102" "Joemanji" 2011-05-16 " best episode yet utterly gripping i found myself holding my breath during the conversation between king robert and cersei and also during the final skirmish poor jory  the episode was better for not having any of the story set over the sea or at the wall i like some of those characters but nothing much is happening to them compared to the machinations in kings landing "
