"2" "MissGlenghis" 2012-05-20 " sorry  dont mean to spam i have reported myself and asked for the post to be deleted hadnt realised i had already posted that once on this episode "
"3" "MissGlenghis" 2012-05-20 " if you wish to discuss the series in tandem with the books please take a look here httptalknotthetalkcomdiscussionlist12604start380pagesize20 i mention this not because i wish to draw people away from the excellent cif but because i know a number of people who have read the book feel frustrated that they cant mention their book knowledge in a blog such as this and the thread given above is set up for exactly those people "
"4" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-20 " well i see that the blog having been frozen for 3 days since 17 may has been released again for posting shame we could have had a good linear discussion  no spoilers here but having continued reading book 2 only a third of the way through so not up to the tv series point at all i can see a lot more detail than in the fimed version inevitably much has been left out but the film is very faithful to the books and i get a lot of depth to the story from seeing the portrayals on screen there are just so many characters and scenarios taking place id love to see a timeline or zone that would help me fathom who is where and when and bannerman or obligated in relation to whom the appendices in the first two books help though not really in terms of time and place i am also yet to fathom the aura surrounding roose bolton and his bastard there have been rather cryptic references on this blog  have i missed this or has bran not yet confirmedrecalled the time he was thrown by jaime from the tower everyone else in westeros  and in winterfell even  refers to the jaimecersei incest and joffrey and his sibs being the product but i dont recall that bran has actually mentioned it yet maybe its just an aspect that has been left out seen as redundant also the dagger that was used to attempt to kill bran  that was originally claimed by lord baelish to belong to tyrion but there seems to have been no further reference to its ownership in the tv series about the search for arya  its tyrion that sent men to look for her  i mean to have arya as well i have men searching to which varys replies searching is not finding so was it gendry roberts bastard son that cersei sent the mountain and others to search for not arya as well i presume there are therefore two lots of people looking for her "

"6" "alecllewellyn" 2012-05-19 " but we only have his word that hes ironborn or the crew are ironborn at all i really dont get this nonsensical speculation theon travels back to pyke is ordered by his father to take a ship and raid some villages so he goes to the harbour in pyke and joins his ship and crew and people are saying that these folks might not be ironborn wtf "

"9" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-17 " mmmm sounds a bit daft to me if all those iron born types turn out not to be iron born types agreed how credible is it that another faction would come up with a bunch of born sailors who were equally good fighters and actors id be more prepared to believe that dagmar is not ironborn though it seems to me that his ability to participate as he does in the missions command can only come from the fact that hes known and accepted by the men hmmm maybe hes the genuine article but has been suborned "
"10" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-17 " mmmm sounds a bit daft to me if all those iron born types turn out not to be iron born types "
"11" "5432Hun" 2012-05-17 " ive tried heroically to lay out my thoughts on this without spoilers or giving so many hints to future plot that i may as well spoiler just cant do it the best i can manage is that whilst dagmarfinchy clearly has taken on some of reek2s role in the action weve just watched in the last episode i dont buy the idea that this character is actually reek in any of his manisfestations "
"12" "Kirjava13" 2012-05-17 " rest assured i will be labouring heroically to bring these tragicallybrief moments to everyones attention every week i liked that even though he only had the one line it was still dripping in inference referring back to his conversation with robb when he first popped up too many prisoners we should probably start flaying them roose mate what is it with you and all the flaying "
"13" "testure" 2012-05-17 " i dont get the episodes ahead of time any more only the first six sobs quietly in thought of the complications involved in watching this in time to get the blog written i think it makes potential sense but only as suggested above because yara never met this bunch of ironborn at all  if you remember dagmar turned up and said hi im dagmar and here are your crew theon took his word for that but we only have his word that hes ironborn or the crew are ironborn at all theon after all wouldnt have a bloody clue i admit this is entirely speculation but i wouldnt be surprised of the differing schools of speculation on this im definitely leaning toward the above discussed it with a few mates and none of us could see a reason why not yes it would take extra jiggery pokery in explaining it but better that than have no dramatic beat for the theon at winterfell story line yes you could just have a new character rock up in the last episodes but that exploits nothing in a purely dramatic sense it would be a bit of a head scratching volte face in terms of the source material but makes perfect sense in tv land westeros the only concern is perhaps an age issue in relative casting "
"14" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-17 " thats one of my favourite things actually he just lurks around making cryptic comments and appearing frosty and then disappears "
"15" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-17 " i dont get the episodes ahead of time any more only the first six sobs quietly in thought of the complications involved in watching this in time to get the blog written i think it makes potential sense but only as suggested above because yara never met this bunch of ironborn at all  if you remember dagmar turned up and said hi im dagmar and here are your crew theon took his word for that but we only have his word that hes ironborn or the crew are ironborn at all theon after all wouldnt have a bloody clue i admit this is entirely speculation but i wouldnt be surprised "
"16" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-17 " i am very impressed by your willpower  also i think it does stand alone as a tv series i like it as a tv series immensely and the changes dont bother me at all "
"17" "lmsava" 2012-05-17 " i dont think reek is necessarily missing i think a certain ironborn lieutenant might not be who he says he is feel free to mock me if im wrong i think the actual character of reek will be left out of the next series but his traits and purpose in the story have certainly been covered by finchy theres a fair bit of speculation that he might not be who he says he is but i think that if this turns out to be true and it will need some explaining if it is then hell be revealed as a certain nobles bastard rather than as reek i do hope to see reek in series four or five  whichever one covers a dance with dragons "
"18" "5432Hun" 2012-05-17 " a question for those having read the books and are watching the series does reading the books beforehand allow you more insights into the characters or are you worrying about some favourite part being left out i guess its different for everyone for myself ive read the books but i never worry as such about what they leave out by and large the changes have worked and its good to have a bit of doubt as to where they are taking it next i also accept that a tv show is a different thing to a book so some cropping is necessary it is interesting though to think through the possible consequences of these changes for plots and characters so i guess in that sense i do feel i have more insight into the characters having said that i watched the first series without having read the books and enjoyed it tremendously without knowing what was happening next i had read the fellowship of the ring before the movie had released and was wondering the whole 2 and a half hours why tom bombadil did not make an appearance thats easy its because hes an annoying arse "
"19" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-05-17 " i think it pleasures you all beyond measures to leave half clues all over the comments and also the sly wont leave spoilers dig its hard enough to contain myself from reading the book wo know what happens next but like the bastard ive taken a vow without thinking clearly too far ahead i will not read the book till the season ends so that i dont spoil the show for mei had read the fellowship of the ring before the movie had released and was wondering the whole 2 and a half hours why tom bombadil did not make an appearancea question for those having read the books and are watching the series does reading the books beforehand allow you more insights into the characters or are you worrying about some favourite part being left out "
"20" "ACertainBang" 2012-05-17 " i am surprised his own harrenhal troops arent rebelling too rebelling against him or deserting must have an outcome worse than death by hanging surely a few of those men are thinking its my neck next the way hes going through them for his investigation yet they still do his bidding scary "
"21" "damnfool" 2012-05-17 " i havent read the books but im guessing jon snows going to go all dances with wolves with the wildlings he seems to be on the way to becoming this very modern free man the wildlings boast about hes already broken his night watchmen vows with his i am jon snow descendent of ned stark distant relative of the first men speech "
"22" "5432Hun" 2012-05-16 " love this show but is the iron thrown actually worth having everyone is fighting everyone else so whoever prevails inherits nothing as weve seen that all allegiances are mostly temporary and expedient that said we need something to arrange all the drama around so not complaining too much very true but the willtorule is a strong force in human history even during periods where winning the throne seemed more trouble than its worth    eg war of roses which is generally believed to have been an influence on grrm human eh cant live with them    "
"23" "5432Hun" 2012-05-16 " i dont think reek is necessarily missing i think a certain ironborn lieutenant might not be who he says he is feel free to mock me if im wrong no sorry sarah not having this you may know something we dont from getting the episodes ahead of time to review them but it doesnt make sense for two reasons 1 the ironborn barely accept theon as their commander even though hes a greyjoy why would they run with a northerner from the green lands 2 someone has already mentioned the other reason why is wouldnt make any sense but i wont repeat it because its potentially a bit spoilery "
"24" "5432Hun" 2012-05-16 " just a small detail but all those men were hanged because tywin believes someone was trying to kill him not amory lurch and dont all those hangings put arya waaaay over her quota of three deaths for the red god quite right i realised later i had made this mistake but decided not to draw attention to it because there are some people on here who think of me as a god i hope youre happy with yourself now youve disappointed them  "

"26" "Kirjava13" 2012-05-16 " also something i feel should be added to the main body of the blog blinkandyoullmissit roose bolton appearance of the week too many prisoners "
"27" "mikepatto" 2012-05-16 " i got the impression hed rubbed through the wooden pole he was chained to with his chains "
"28" "weewilkie" 2012-05-16 " and also didnt roose bolton tell robb that he would send his bastard to retake winterfell so theres no need for the reek disguise if hes known alive and well and able to muster some men its a departure from the book is all im sure we wont see reek ah sweet hubris "
"29" "Cariad007" 2012-05-16 " he doesnt seem to have the necessary personal hygiene requirements for reek though "
"30" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-16 " im so sorry  i havent read all the comments yet though i promise i will forgive me therefore if this has already been mentioned but how did jaime manage to kill his cousin when he was by his own admission chained to a post with a collar round his neck too was it a kind of boys own with one bound he was free sort of thing i think he had a certain amount of freedom to move within the cage re the escape itself it seemed very unwise to me for the starks to leave the keys on a guard who might have to go into the cage "
"31" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-16 " meant to add this is admittedly pure speculation and my own opinion "
"32" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-16 " i dont think reek is necessarily missing i think a certain ironborn lieutenant might not be who he says he is feel free to mock me if im wrong "

"34" "VonSparron" 2012-05-16 " btw what is the currency in westeros coins  specifically gold silver and coppper ones stamped either with dragons from aeryss reign or stags from roberts reign "
"35" "VonSparron" 2012-05-16 " ok maybe not changes but reek and the reeds are fairly key to progressing both storylines its a bit difficult to discuss this without giving spoilers  "
"36" "Kirjava13" 2012-05-16 " her story was that her mother was a maid for lady soandso if tywin believes her and i think his tired never met a literate stone mason and aryas inspired she taught me to speak proper properly indicate that he probably does then he has no reason to think that she has any political worth or value to him shes just an interesting young girl whos smart resourceful and independent and she reminds him of the promise his own children bar tyrion had when they were young hes iron most of the time but hes getting on he knows this war will be his last whether its won or lost and i think we can allow him a touch of sentimentality perhaps with his children increasingly estranged he thinks of his dead wife more and more or remembers back to when jaime and circe were infants "
"37" "Ceri333" 2012-05-16 " just a small detail but all those men were hanged because tywin believes someone was trying to kill him not amory lurch and dont all those hangings put arya waaaay over her quota of three deaths for the red god i am not sure that finding the note on amory would automatically mean that arya had necessarily given it to him  maybe others had access to that room  but it would definitely make her a major suspect something tywin would absolutely deal with but maybe tywin had no idea the note existed perhaps littlefinger wrote it specifically for arya knowing she would clear the table maybe it is a trap good thing that note just magically disappeared "
"38" "5432Hun" 2012-05-16 " it could easily have been poisoned without aryas knowledge in which case the test would have been a waste of a good cupbearer as weve seen tywin avoids wasting human resources so i dont think it was a test i think he was just giving arya some food it was a nice touch to have tywin insist she eats the food despite the fact she didnt want any this is a man who gets his own way if hes generous enough to give you some food you better eat it right up and be suitably grateful for his munificence "
"39" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-16 " perhaps he did fear that the mutton might be poisoned and set her a test it could easily have been poisoned without aryas knowledge in which case the test would have been a waste of a good cupbearer as weve seen tywin avoids wasting human resources so i dont think it was a test i think he was just giving arya some food "
"40" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-16 " so tywin now knows that shes the daughter of a nobleman from the north    surely arya would move from cupbearer to welltreated hostage the instant that thought crossed tywins mind even the daughter of a minor house would have political value  enough value to make him put her somewhere safe and find another cupbearer it does seem like a weak point though aryas explanations of how she came to be such an educated wellspoken commoner at the very least invite questions logically tywin should be asking those questions and keeping a closer eye on her "
"41" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-16 " the tywin  arya scene was great once more but did anyone else think that tywin only offered her his food because he suspected it might be poisoned it did occur to me as he offered it but he didnt eat the meal after arya had tasted it so i think he genuinely didnt want it "
"42" "5432Hun" 2012-05-16 " yes hes a terrible father and a massive bastard to all tcommon folk he does however always buy his round when hes up and in my book that cancels out a multitude of sins ned stark on the other hand may have talked a lot about honour but there was always some excuse when it camwe to his turn   oh im just having a soft drink this time lads so i wont get a round tight prick "
"43" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-16 " hes also a very bad father as we can see by his increasingly dysfunctional children and grandchildrenthe incest between cersei and jaime may be a result of his lack of parenting skills does he also not oppress his people to the point of rebellion as is evident by his troops spending a lot of time combating rebels in the countryside "
"44" "5432Hun" 2012-05-16 " on the other hand maybe we overestimate tywins abilities simply because he talks a good game he has been losing his battles to young robb stark but he did rebuild the lannisters to being the richest and most powerful family in the landhe deserves a little bit of credit "
"45" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-16 " on the other hand maybe we overestimate tywins abilities simply because he talks a good game he has been losing his battles to young robb stark "
"46" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-05-16 " response to acertainbang 16 may 2012 519am2 stags i think  if only it were varys instead of littlefinger id have loved some clues being dropped about aryas presence to cersei littlefinger has come across a little less scheming and political and more of a profit monger and i am not getting started on his accent "
"47" "5432Hun" 2012-05-16 " one argument is that tyrion cant risk the starks finding out that he doesnt have arya it would massively change their bargaining position when trying to broker jamies return very few people actually know that arya is awol and of those that do tyrion either doesnt trust that theyd reveal the information if captured or cant do without them at kings landing he cant risk sending information like this by raven in case it gets intercepted however saying that im surprised littlefinger didnt mention it last week no i dont accept this if he can send his niece to dorne and ravens about military movements are runofthemill then he could have sent a trusted messenger with an armed escort up to harrenhall its entirely possible that tywin does know arya is missing but would anyone really expect a 12 year old girl to have made her way through a war zone survive torture and assault and appear 100s of miles away from kings landing and also amass a healthy number of kills by this stage the lannisters have more likely given her up for dead but are just covering this up again no sorry this doesnt ring true of a character as intelligent and ruthless as tywin weve just seen him hanging people and send the mountain to raze the villages because someone killed amory lorch if he thought there was even a chance that arya stark was at large he would have sent intructions that every northern girl found was to be brought to him unharmed he didnt get where he is today without attending to details "
"48" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-05-16 " response to thenorthremembers 16 may 2012 854am respond is again missing   i agree with the notion that petyr baelish may have realized aryas real identity at harrelhal but then leaving her with tywin was probably the worst he could do he cannot gain anything from telling cersei or tyrion that arya is with their father neither can he tell robbcatelyn in riverrun that he left arya with the enemy when he had promised catelyn that he would protect her daughterswas the note from the table discovered on amory lorch he could have easily deduced aryas involvement into the murder then i think that he wishes arya was his daughter and hence is turning blind eye to the other signs hence that careful now girl and has someone told you that you are too smart for your own good any other general would not have taken that proper properly quip so lightlyi think we saw tywins anguish alright when talking about his father but i am sensing that the verbal sparring between mr dance and ms williams may soon be over how i cannot yet fathomits been a struggle from trying to read the second book for some weeks now "
"49" "5432Hun" 2012-05-16 " torrhens square was the fort theon attacked to draw out winterfells forces to be fair there are a couple of plotholes in the tv version which the op rightly identifies  especially what happened to ser rodricks 200 men  but these caused by necessarily having to reduce certain elements of the story so my vote is to live with them "
"50" "5432Hun" 2012-05-16 " afaik ravens work like homing pigeons to send a message to a specific location youve got to have one thats trained to fly to that location presumably tywin has ravens trained to contact casterly rock or kings landing but tyrion doesnt have ravens trained to find tywin somewhere in the riverlands tywin is at harrenhall and has been since episode 3 or maybe 4 "
"51" "BeesSting" 2012-05-16 " on subject of nights watch it seemed a little too convenient that jon was left to despatch ygritte and of course didnt kill her thus isolating him from his brothers  then i thought that perhaps thoren left him with her sos he could poke her with two different types of swordafter all the nw is full of murderers and rapists and thorne is grizzled enough to know his men need a release now and then even though its against their precious vows "
"52" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-16 " response to ninnyhammer by acertainbang16 may 2012 423am  you are probably right on the money with 2 tyrion needs all the leverage he can get he may also think that theres still a chance arya will be found so no need to go crying to daddy just yet it was littlefinger whom cersei charged with finding arya something we suspect he has done that plus tywins notfaroffthemark probing mean our little teatime chats with dance and williams may soon be over my two pennies into this discussion about arya tyrion and tywin1 tyrion is not in a position to searchhunt arya its not like any of the citizens in kings landing are keen on helping the king or the imp2 not telling tywin that arya is missing allows tyrion to blackmail cerseijoffery3 as tyrion of unaware of aryas presence in harrenhal according to him tywin can only blow apeshit once he gets the news4 the more people know about aryas disappearance the higher probability it has of reaching robbs camp last i heard spies were in abundance on both sides5 even if arya  sansa  jamie its not in the stark nature to put a strategic value against their daughters lives its also not the lannister way to treat a family member firstly the means of communication i think it was suggested earlier that ravens could go from harrenhal to kings landing but not in reverse but im less than a quarter of the way through book 2 so far so no spoiler here and a chapter earlier has tyrion say doubtless stannis sent a bird to casterly rock and another to harrenhal so harrenhal was clearly connected the means were there secondly  who knows about arya in support of what ninnyhammer says it may be that cersei is indeed disinclined to keep her father informed  she had naively wanted tywin to be kept unawares of stannis allegation that joffrey was born of incest  although tyrion added i imagine father has heard rather more than a hint by now so tyrion at least is tuned in to the likelihood that tywin knows quite a bit of whats going on in the wider westeros i am assuming that littlefinger might also know about arya having been charged to find her but that he is not letting on to cersei after all he is now in a unique position with maybe more information than varys for a change to use this to advantage in discussions with catelyn and tyrion at some point he did not get far with tywin did he  on his part tywin knows that arya is a girl that had masqueraded as a boy when brought to harrenhal by the cloaks from kings landing he knows that the cloaks had actually set out to find roberts bastard gendry not her but he must have put his mind to why arya would pretend to be a boy put together with knowing thata this is a highborn girl who is lying to him b the note in dead amory lorchs hand came from his own table where she served c arya has been reported missingfled yet he has not yet been formally notifiedhell most likely have sussed her and is keeping his friends close and his enemies closer tywin avoids the risk of poisoning by getting her to eat the meat first i think hes actually intrigued by her she may seem almost as if she was the daughter he wishes he had had he respects her cunning and wit he could keep her a prisoner but he no doubt knows that by keeping his powder dry she may have little need to attempt escape after all why has she not done so already if she wishes indeed tywin is almost flirting with arya after all he was not the one that executed her father hell also be aware that she could be the key to getting jaime back although hes not exactly in a state of anguish about his son it would seem btw does tywin actually do anguish  so i surmise that both littlefinger and tywin know who arya is and both are keeping that info to themselves lf because information is a source of power for him and tywin because its a useful diplomatic tool to have in his armoury rather than entrust tyrion and cersei with it "
"53" "ACertainBang" 2012-05-16 " i think tyrion paid pycelles prosser with a stag you are probably right on the money with 2 tyrion needs all the leverage he can get he may also think that theres still a chance arya will be found so no need to go crying to daddy just yet it was littlefinger whom cersei charged with finding arya something we suspect he has done that plus tywins notfaroffthemark probing mean our little teatime chats with dance and williams may soon be over "
"54" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-05-16 " my two pennies into this discussion about arya tyrion and tywin 1 tyrion is not in a position to searchhunt arya its not like any of the citizens in kings landing are keen on helping the king or the imp2 not telling tywin that arya is missing allows tyrion to blackmail cerseijoffery3 as tyrion of unaware of aryas presence in harrenhal according to him tywin can only blow apeshit once he gets the news4 the more people know about aryas disappearance the higher probability it has of reaching robbs camp last i heard spies were in abundance on both sides5 even if arya  sansa  jamie its not in the stark nature to put a strategic value against their daughters lives its also not the lannister way to treat a family member5 why does tywin trust arya so much surely a northern girl with unknown but suspiciously noble origins pose a greater danger to a person of his stature bearing his cup and then poisoning him wouldnt require a lot of efforts i think thats worth a pound atleastbtw what is the currency in westeros "

"58" "pillroad" 2012-05-16 " yes i think it is a little bit of a plot hole because its strongly probable that tyrion would tell his father that arya was missing rather than keep it a secret to cover up for cersei however in return for introducing this slight plot hole the writers have given us the pleasure of all the tywinarya scenes so i feel more than compensated one argument is that tyrion cant risk the starks finding out that he doesnt have arya it would massively change their bargaining position when trying to broker jamies return very few people actually know that arya is awol and of those that do tyrion either doesnt trust that theyd reveal the information if captured or cant do without them at kings landing he cant risk sending information like this by raven in case it gets intercepted however saying that im surprised littlefinger didnt mention it last week its entirely possible that tywin does know arya is missing but would anyone really expect a 12 year old girl to have made her way through a war zone survive torture and assault and appear 100s of miles away from kings landing and also amass a healthy number of kills by this stage the lannisters have more likely given her up for dead but are just covering this up "
"59" "pillroad" 2012-05-16 " having read all the books this episode felt a little bit like it was just exposition for what comes next that being said the scenes with aryatywin and tyrioncersei were really excellent in general i dont mind the changes that have been made from the books as they are fairly minor to the overarching plot lines  characters merging or their roles being taken by others but this has worked better in some cases than others im not sure how brantheon story arcs are going to get back on track oh and jamie is awesome back on track brans story is very close to the book except with the absencechange of certain side characters who can be introduced in later seasons if necessary theons arc is pretty much exactly the same as the book but with dagmer replacing reek as the devil on his shoulder theres no significant changes to their overall arcs "
"60" "pillroad" 2012-05-15 " ok now i really need a diagram for what theons men are up to he sails up with a small force weve seen about ten guys obviously theres supposed to be more but they do only have one boat so it cant be many to feint at some villages drawing out the men who would normally guard winterfell did they say 200 men before then his guys head up to winterfell somehow travelling faster than the men who are coming the opposite way to get them and take it pretty much bloodlessly then the leader of the guards shows up alone for some reason im not quite clear on are the rest waiting back at the clearlynotunderattack fishing villages or are they travelling so much slower than theon that they havent even got there yet and now about 24 hours later theon feels safe enough to set out with a few men into the countryside leaving the offcamera portion of his men to hold the castle all i can think is that they sailed up to winterfell moving considerably faster than horses is there a river theres no major river they went over land basically the iron born have attacked the entire west coast of the north en masse and without warning remember yaras fleet her ships and many more have laid seige to a number of coastal towns and castles this will be introduced in later seasons but balons brother victarion is also a major war leader amongst the iron born and commands the elite iron fleet which is bigger than yaras the show hasnt stressed this as much as it could but theon is actually quite clever he knows how the northerners operate and knew by attacking a particular fortress they did say but i cant remember the name winterfell would send relief from their own forces he anticipates this and leads a small force literally around 20  40 men to take the fortress by stealth at night it will have taken him some time to reach winterfell from the coast at least a week or two even on horse back the north is huge about the size of brazil however because its sparsely populated it would be possible for a small party to go unnoticed the move to take winterfell was clever everything else he does there is a disaster of course what he should have done was take bran and rickon away to pyke as hostages remember the northerners werent expecting the islanders to attack partly because of theon and robs relationship partly because they were courting them as allies robs deal for balon was actually a very good one but mainly because as will be revealed later there is no longterm political gain for them the whole thing is balon getting back at ned stark anyway because of this they werent ready to defend an attack from any where except their southern borders and things become very chaotic this presumably is how ser roderick got caught he would have no way to know winterfell was occupied when he returned from the coast it will take a while for the north to get organised and retake winterfell in the meantime theon is hoping to be reenforced and hold the fortress "

"133" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-05-15 " sarahhughes  thenorthremembersmaybe jamie isnt that smart he can be really ruthless may it be murdering the mad king or pushing bran from the watchtower or even murdering alton jamie seems to lack the intelligence to see the outcomenot having read the books i am unaware of the circumstances of back stabbing but all his other actions seemed to have failed in achieving the result bran still lives and jamie is still chained in a cell in robbs camp "
"134" "avdotya" 2012-05-15 " to be absolutely fair jaime was pretty upfront with alton that he was going to die granted he only got a few seconds notice but as hed spent what felt like the last hour slavishly drooling over the memory of squiring for the slayer sorry buffy he did walk right into it and with no weapons in the pen there wasnt much alternative but for jaime to batter him like a haddock not that im saying its cool to horribly murder your own cousin but needs must when youre covered in poo although it did all feel a bit pointless when jaime got recaptured anyway what im essentially saying is the incident wasnt that much out of character and jaimes manner of dealing with his incarceration gave us a nice compare and contrast with the time that tyrion was at the mercy of catelyns sister lysa "

"138" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-15 " as to alton  i didnt mind that because i felt for jaime the whole idea of escape meant the ends justified the means and alton was such a minor branch of the family that he wasnt real kin as such there is definitely a deviation from the books but its not one i mind as i think it sets up an idea of jaime as someone who values freedom whether the freedom of the sword or freedom of the mind as more important than anything actually the scene drew interestingly on the books and in a different place i would discuss how this links in well with what book jaime says about his time guarding aegon what i found puzzling about this scene and it was mentioned earlier is that jaime kills alton alton could just have played dead with the same result for jaime "
"139" "PeachMcGee" 2012-05-15 " so freakin excited to see jaime this week he absolutely crackles with electric charisma ncw pulls off all facets of this complex character so beautifully that i dont even notice his peculiar accent although his accent is actually quite similar to tyrions so maybe its a casterly rock thing one minor niggle ill be very disappointed if jons plotline hinges on him just following the urges of his bone and stones "

"143" "monkey2" 2012-05-15 " wow definitely the best episode so far some thoughts 1 arya and tywin have struck up a brilliant relationship he has known for some time who she is and his little comments and gestures are intended to test her nerve i even think she knows that he knows which makes their screen time all the more captivating 2 jaime is an excellent character a super hard machiavellian sister shagger spending the entire series sitting in his own shit in a tiny cell constantly facing the prospect of being executed is taken by him with a remakable dignity more of the same please 3 cerseis minibreakdown this week was both suprising and concerning obviously she is completely deluded the reason joffrey is so cruel is that he takes after her what did she expect her breakdown is concerning as it has evoked tyrions sympathy as we know tyrion has a soft spot for women and this could be a play by her to get him on board for some of the more disastrous things she and joffrey are planning the jury is still out on this storyline 4 theon is a complete idiot he is effectively joffreys alter ego a kid playing grown up games of war he has neither the competence nor the nerve to handle i predict an appalling end for him 5 jon snow i think he should just join the wildlings no one else cares for him he has hitherto had a shit life with nothing to look forward to this was summed up brilliantly by jaime when he said that jon snow would never be loved as he is a bastard this is correct and everyone knows it 6 complete lack of stanis berathean this is perhaps what made the episode so good 7 yes the house theon raided seemed completely out of place compared to all other homes we have had casteles tents and mud huts however this seemed to be a cottage in oxfordshire that could reasonably be someones home today not a place you would find in westeros musings over "

"204" "DiamondDag" 2012-05-15 " that is the guy who has killed so many people he feels no remorse that is the guy who pushed a kid out of a window without twice thinking about the consequences that is the kind of guy who would stab a king in the back then calmly sit on the throne that is jaime thing is ive always thought those things are just the side of jaimie he wants you to see everyone calls him the kingslayer and he acts like it doesnt even matter to him tywin sees right through it though and calls him on it in series 1 all the signs are there that he just acts like people expect him to hes as disillusioned about what it means to be knight as the hound is hes not some emotionless badass killing machine i think that would be a horrible direction to take the character in and i think youre rather going over the top saying killing his cousin was more defining than anything grrm has done with the character but obviously down that road spoilers lie "

"207" "testure" 2012-05-15 " excellent addition to the jaime storyline he was supposed to be this ruthless killer  and in the books all he did was mope around like some emo knight with floppy hair and a chip on his shoulder the moment when he bludgeoned his own cousin without even a second thought did more to define his character than grrm managed in 5 novels that is the guy who has killed so many people he feels no remorse that is the guy who pushed a kid out of a window without twice thinking about the consequences that is the kind of guy who would stab a king in the back then calmly sit on the throne that is jaime but despite what he does grrm makes you kinda like him  even to root for him i kind of disagree with all of this thats the shorthand for the opinion every other character has of jamie martin makes us like him because jamie acknowledges his reputation with a great deal of pathos if not exactly remorse in many ways hes the antihypocrite character he addresses all of those things hes done and is supposed to have done i particularly love his take on the getting caught on the throne thing hes been a bastard no doubt about it but taking the description above at face value is dismissing his code its this that makes him the complicated and dare i say it likeable character that he isbecomes the scenes in this episode with jamie were fantastic because they scratch his surface so well id just be hesitant to dismiss martins role when its he who gave jaime the not insubstantial depth below itof which these scenes are heavily heavily riffing off by the way "

"211" "StrawBear" 2012-05-15 " i agreewhy they had to turn jamie into a murderer rather than at worst a cad who boffs his sister i do not know im loving his character arch in the books its odd that they hardened him and yet softened other characters slightly theon and cersei to some degree i can cope with nuance its maddening that season one stuck to the books and was a hit and so with season two they pen whole episodes where theres only a few seasons from the source i can see why they ditched riverrun but am increasingly failing to see why they feel they have to add more to the story whilst at the same time removing some of the nice details why was sansas flowering scene altered so why is there no reek so much stuff has been slightly shifted leaving the whole plot to potentially unravel im worrying now that the tv series will alter the books for the worst and wtf is the valyrian florence nightingale doing there with her curiously 21c way of speaking cant robb just be a horny little bastard does he have to be honourable because hes a goody the beauty of asofai is the texture of the characters the story frankly is a god almighty mess at this point but i dont care about pig riding if theres texture happening it sums it up that mostly the wifes really liked it yet with this weeks she found it boring and engaging i felt this week was the furtherest the screenwriting had strayed from the novelization coincidence for the first time she had to ask me what the hell had happened in a couple of instances it feels that a novel that took years to work out and write has been rehashed badly by writers with no thought for anything more than this weeks episode if it carries on this way it will lose any soon to be confused nonreaders and piss off the fans also a morale quenching lack of tits this week boo "
"212" "DocPoo" 2012-05-15 " as epic as the whole thing is for me those few scenes with tywin lannister charles dance and arya stark maisie williams have the most tension in them which is strange as it mostly consists of fetch me this and bring me that style dialogue i think that girl has a great future ahead if she chooses acting as her career when shes an adult btw im also looking forward to the neil marshall directed episode the descent is still one of my favourite movies "

"215" "MsBlancheHudson" 2012-05-14 " i dont know about the rest of you but i rather love the portrayal of ygritte as the sort of stroppy northern lass no i dont love her portrayal at all there is a cliche in tv and film making that a freespirited independent selfreliant woman has to be portrayed as a rude stroppy pain in the ase frequently harping at the male actor i actually  and this is often the deathknell of my interest in a show  drifted out of the room to put the kettle on during one of the ygritte scenes not a good sign i should be welded to that sofa in a show like this not wandering off to find the earl grey there were shining bits this episode  jaime arya and tywin cersai was a particular standout  and in a scene with tyrion thats high praise indeed "
"216" "Wonketteer" 2012-05-14 " what was your favourite line this week my fellows i liked cerseis awkward approximation of the truth joffreys always been difficult "
"217" "dotmegsam" 2012-05-14 " was waiting to see how slavishly they would follow the books and it looks like surely with exec producer g r r martins approval they are not all i can say is much as i enjoyed the books thank goodness not changing characters or their arcs but tidying up the trajectories and even in the case of arya and tywin improving on the original brilliant and makes it more exciting for us read the books know whats coming bores "
"218" "JonnnyA" 2012-05-14 " not sure it was necessary to have jaime killing one of his own cousins now he just looks like a twat rather than a character who is in the books anyway rather more complex and increasingly likeable i hope this isnt a we are making it for the yanks for gods sake dumb it down moment though as alton lannister was brought about for that exact reason i wont get my hopes up excellent addition to the jaime storyline he was supposed to be this ruthless killer  and in the books all he did was mope around like some emo knight with floppy hair and a chip on his shoulder the moment when he bludgeoned his own cousin without even a second thought did more to define his character than grrm managed in 5 novels that is the guy who has killed so many people he feels no remorse that is the guy who pushed a kid out of a window without twice thinking about the consequences that is the kind of guy who would stab a king in the back then calmly sit on the throne that is jaime but despite what he does grrm makes you kinda like him  even to root for him "
"219" "DiamondDag" 2012-05-14 " agree on all points it was a very strong lannister episode away from the witty lines and histrionics this was peter dinklage showing what a great actor he is good to see cersei with more to do than just be drunk as for jaimie ive said it before but go back and watch the scene between him and ned in the throne room at kings landing costerwaldau nails everything about jaimie at that point and has done since "
"220" "airflow" 2012-05-14 " loving arya and hoping theyre faithful to her story as it develops in the books some of my favorite stuff in the series "
"221" "Woof73" 2012-05-14 " oops apologies for the spoil thats what i get for trying to be funny "
"222" "BlueCalx" 2012-05-14 " im with you on jaime loved that little scene with him in the cage remembering his days as selmys squire i think hed agree with our recent debate on the hardest man in westeros contest and i liked the comment was it sarah about his fatalism an excellent portrayal of a man who has lived his entire life by the sword "
"223" "gooddogs" 2012-05-14 " jaime lannister is the ultimate psychopath charming handsome ruthless manipulative intelligent and in the end has no conscience at all "
"224" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-14 " yay "
"225" "JonnnyA" 2012-05-14 " also love the way david and dan have rethought the whole qarth plot i like this version much better than the book version "
"226" "JonnnyA" 2012-05-14 " im not surprised thats two episodes he and his cohorts have been missing from the story they did say he was sailing on kings landing with 200 ships  what are they going to do cut to stannis screaming ship ahoy  hardly riveting tv  that one scene nailed jamies character better than grrm managed in the entire novel series "
"227" "HonestIago" 2012-05-14 " series 2 has pulled off two great tricks that the books never quite managed making cersei a sympathetic character and making tywin lannister something more than a onedimensional badass there have been a lot of compelling moments but the most shocking thing theyve shown so far is cersei completely dropping her guard with tyrion that scene was exceptional and completely unexpected i loved tyrions reaction or nonreaction to the revelation about joffrey and his warmth about cersei beating the odds with myrcella and tommen the aryatywin scenes are also staggeringly welldone and id be perfectly happy if there was an episode that was just a twohander between the pair of them it adds so much to tywins character to see the warmth underneath his public projections and unlike in the books you can completely understand why tyrion wants to be like his father and how strong the similarities between the two are the other aspect of those scenes is you get the impression charles dance is having an absolute blast and a lot of the paternal warmth is actually what dance feels for the preternaturally talented maisie williams as for jaimie it really was a lannisterheavy episode im continually impressed with just how completely costerwaldau inhabits the character  its like the part was written for him he completely nails the kingslayers charisma and incredible levels of fckedupness his strength and his fragility mesmerising stuff "
"228" "gooddogs" 2012-05-14 " hahahahahahahahaha thank you "
"229" "DiamondDag" 2012-05-14 " i know this is entirely impossible but it almost feels like theyve added in extra tywin and arya scenes after the success of the first ones i just didnt expect them to have so much time together very welcome though burn the villages burn the farms let them know what it means to choose the wrong side yeah thats the tywin i know "
"230" "5onthe5" 2012-05-14 " loving ralph ineson as dagmer but i feel the urge to greet his every appearance onscreen with these immortal words who wants a pinch of finch "
"231" "testure" 2012-05-14 " i can remember being somewhat displeased with episode 3 for largely unremembered reasons but since the 4th week season 2 episodes have been progressing like cerseis incestuous children each one becoming more agreeable than the last she just needs to have seven more while my workplace watercooler conversations have been split in almost bookreadervieweronly apartheid the sometimes bewildering though mostly successful changes in the adaptation have won the readers over and crucially left us less smug and on something of a level playing field with the unwashed george martin agnostics for this very reason the most interesting thing to come out of this weeks episode has to be sarahs theory on ralph inestons dagmer character he of the distinctly uncleft jaw once mooted you can see the possibility for an extraduplicitous dimension here but really im left excitedly none the wiser until season 2 finishes its that kind of show i suppose so yeah moot on sarah moot like the wind "

"233" "MoreTears" 2012-05-14 " the us life on mars wasnt as good as the british one but was it dumber i dont think so frankly the original wasnt exactly complex anyway your analogy doesnt really hold water the got tv series isnt an adaptation of something british the book series is american as in written by an american and originally published in the us "
"234" "Bellatrixlestrange" 2012-05-14 " woof73 im agreeing with diamonddag that your post is a bit spoilerriffic i really enjoyed the scenes with jon and ygritte they made us wait for the you know nothing line but it was well delivered when it came her teeth are far too good thoughthis episode was a bit of an odd one for me i liked all the individual parts but overall it felt a bit slowpaced despite the amount of violence "
"235" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-14 " best episode yet yay more sense of scale than usual with the pan up harrenhal and then the shot of robs camp pretty much every scene was a corker and acting was all greatgood  including alfie loving getting into jaimes character full on events in qarth good stuff in iceland lannisters central deffo a good thing as been said before very happy "

"237" "DiamondDag" 2012-05-14 " woof73 watch those spoilers you pretty much just told everyone about something not even vaguely hinted at so far jon and ygritte they did seem to bash you over the head with the celibacy thing but i still enjoy the story going on north of the wall however jon has gone a bit flat hasnt he kit harington did a fine job all through series 1 so i dont think its him as such maybe ygritte will get him going yeah and i smiled at that line sigh the return of jamie i thought theyd maybe pushed him too far over the edge with that killing but then he still gives those hints that despite what he tells the world he isnt rotten it all comes back to the mad king some other interesting changes but i didnt mind them and ill just leave it at that oh actually they made me feel sorry for cersei thats just going too far "

"257" "Spacedone" 2012-05-14 " agree about harrenhal thats just a beautiful setcgi creation  it looks brilliant best scene this week was arya and tywin charles dance has done an excellent job with tywin making him a convincing man to be feared yet also a father figure to who people like cersei and tyrion are always comparing themselves tywin and aryas scene was almost like father and daughter with tywin pleased at aryas spirit and intelligence but also warning her not to be a smartarse with him weakest scenes this week were jon snow and ygritte very clunky dialogueacting and not particularly convincing having said that this part of snows story is probably my least favourite bit in the book too "

"265" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-14 " my suspicion is that these were children from the farm that they had approached ya think    they didnt prefigure that at all    i just find it hard to believe that they would just kill off the two youngest stark children  hang on though their dad was finished off sudddenly   but the two direwolves would have protected the boys surely "
"266" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-14 " so tywin now knows that shes the daughter of a nobleman from the north    if only someone had told him that ned starks daughter escaped and is missing    hes going to go ballistic if he ever returns to kings landing   i got the feeling that tywin knows more than hes letting on i think hes slowly reeling arya in and warned her about her backchat  my lord rather than milord perhaps he did fear that the mutton might be poisoned and set her a test the moment when she considered slitting his throat  true that she briefly contemplated this but why take the chance when jaqen hghar is at hand "
