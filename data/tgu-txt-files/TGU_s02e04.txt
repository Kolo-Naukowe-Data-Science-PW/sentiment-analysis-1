"2" "MJ1972" 2012-04-28 " please dont take offence mj that was merely a heavy handed attempt at a bit of tongue in cheek humour your use of the word worryingly would seem to suggest otherwise but ok if you say so no offence sunnyone were all good "
"3" "sunnyone" 2012-04-28 " are you kidding me this thread is full of comments to the effect of im glad ros didnt end up doing with that sceptre what i thought she was going to do with it and i was relieved to see that the sceptre didnt end up going where i thought it was going seriously read the thread in its entirety and youll see that im far from alone on this or alternatively have a look at how many people recommended my post versus yours that should give you an idea please dont take offence mj that was merely a heavy handed attempt at a bit of tongue in cheek humour "
"4" "MJ1972" 2012-04-28 " maybe  and worryingly  mj1972 saw the scene differently from most of us are you kidding me this thread is full of comments to the effect of im glad ros didnt end up doing with that sceptre what i thought she was going to do with it and i was relieved to see that the sceptre didnt end up going where i thought it was going seriously read the thread in its entirety and youll see that im far from alone on this or alternatively have a look at how many people recommended my post versus yours that should give you an idea for what its worth when my boyfriend and i were watching that scene we both looked at each other and said shes not really going to fuck her with that is she only to breathe a sigh of relief when what ensued was merely a good hard whack of course its possible that joffrey ordered ros to fuck her colleague with it afterwards but thats not what was shown on tv as far as im concerned the show threatened but didnt deliver and thank the gods old and new for that  panyanpickle this scene is not in the books the entire character of ros isnt in the books if i remember correctly there is a scene in the books where tyrion contemplates taking joffrey to a brothel to er draw his venom but to the best of my knowledge he doesnt actually go through with it there is definitely no scene in the books where joffrey tortures prostitutes i would have remembered that  "
"5" "sunnyone" 2012-04-27 " can anyone who has actually read the books give a definitive answer to this burning question i may well be wrong but i dont think this exact scene was in the bookhowever for what its worth i thought this scene was a lot less harrowing than it could have been  definitely not as nasty as i thought it was going to be from what had been written about it before its uk monday evening screening maybe  and worryingly  mj1972 saw the scene differently from most of us "

"7" "Shackalack" 2012-04-27 " cracking episode watching with a nbr i had to suppress a few wtf why is that already being shown moments but overall thought it was wonderfully done agree with those posters on the mountain not nearly imposing enough for the character more of a bean pole than a fell shame on you hbo agree with scandibaby and sarah re woof73  actually cried laughing well done squire or rather your grace "
"8" "badger1969" 2012-04-27 " just some numbers that help indicate the fairly epic scale of this series in the 4 hours of season 2 shown so far weve seen 25 major characters based on the actors having their names included in the opening credits and another 54 named characters even allowing for the fact that maybe a handful of those named characters are as insignificant as the no names  rennick just happened to be named before he died for example  youre still talking more than 70 characters who are significant to some degree or another  are mostly recognisable to those who have read the books and thats not counting either the characters from s1 that havent returned so far or those we havent even met yet i cant imagine that there are many other tv shows that have attempted to squeeze quite so much into such a short amount of time so far i think theyre doing pretty damned well "

"13" "MJ1972" 2012-04-27 " i quite like her but i got the feeling that shes a madam rather than a random whore littlefinger definitely seems to be setting her up as a madam of sorts but judging from the last two episodes she still does the odd bit of work she must be thought of as one of the best prostitutes in kings landing for her to be sent to the kings rooms "
"14" "MJ1972" 2012-04-27 " but as far as what hbo wants well an anecdote might be on point when the script for the pilot for six feet under was submitted to hbo hbo returned it with only one note can it be more fucked up ha that about sums it up which reminds me i should probably seek out more six feet under i casually followed the series for a season and really liked it but lost touch afterwards im curious to see what became of the family "
"15" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-04-26 " ros im sick of her id rather they used random prostitutes as the impression im getting is that shes the only whore in westeros i thought brothels were supposed to cater for wide and varied tastes its ridiculous that all the powerful men in the land would choose her  i quite like her but i got the feeling that shes a madam rather than a random whore "
"16" "glitterfairy11" 2012-04-26 " i was very late watching this week stupid social life but i had a few thoughts overall i thought it was the best episode of the series except for 2 things 1  cat and littlefinger i thought it was unnecessary and i hated that they seem to be giving another of her ideas to someone else especially that one 2  ros im sick of her id rather they used random prostitutes as the impression im getting is that shes the only whore in westeros i thought brothels were supposed to cater for wide and varied tastes its ridiculous that all the powerful men in the land would choose her especially as shes no spring chicken  she looks a similar age to me early 30s and i thought that was quite old in whore years anyway that said i loved it renly and stannis renly and littlefinger bronn arya and gendrysome very good stuff this week im reserving judgement on jeynes metamorphosis into this new character but im cautiously optimistic on a completely different note it amused me greatly that the tickler favoured a torture method used in 2 fast 2 furious  i thought hed be much more evil than a low rent miami gangster "
"17" "5432Hun" 2012-04-26 " ok im very late here and im sure im wrong butis it possible that littlefingers accent is in fact deliberate where did his own family come from before he attached himself to a noble house is it possible that the rest of his old real family speak with irish accents he successfully lost his own and now for some reason or other its slipping back littlefinger comes from the an area on the east coast of westeros called the fingers and was fostered at riverrun which is to the west he then went to kings landing in the service of john arryn if he was a real person it wouldnt be surprising if his accent was a bit of a mix but if thats really what aiden gillan is tryign to portray then hes being too clever for his own good theres no point trying to represent a mixed up accent when the viewer has no frame of reference which allows them to say did you hear that littlefingers accent just went a bit fingerish "
"18" "DocDiv" 2012-04-26 " even the wise words of king lear fall short of explaining either joffrey or his simpering avatars twisted motives in that scene why dost thou lash that whore strip thine own backthou hotly lust’st to use her in that kindfor which thou whipp’st her  shakespeare "

"33" "MoreTears" 2012-04-25 " rome obviously took a lot of liberties with historical fact and i didnt begrudge them dramatic licence but as far as what hbo wants well an anecdote might be on point when the script for the pilot for six feet under was submitted to hbo hbo returned it with only one note can it be more fucked up if it isnt fucked up it just isnt fit for hbo so there is a need for characters to exhibit behavioural extremes that wouldnt be permitted on standard tv in america that is how not just hbo but the other premium cable channels like showtime and starz sell themselves to their subscribers see on our channel what the networks will not allow you to see on theirs "

"40" "5432Hun" 2012-04-25 " ros  alayaya i suppose that would work although ros doesnt strike me as a the kind of girl who would sacrifice herself agree its not a perfect fit and they may just lose that subplot altogether but if they want to keep it in as part of what motivates another character then i cant see how else they would manage it "
"41" "MarkLondon11" 2012-04-25 " best episode of this series so farhaving read all the books up to dance with dragons reading part one now i think the producers have done a good job of fitting in enough of the main characters while seemingly merging some of the lesser characters stories to save screen time and yet tell the story faithfully ten 40odd minute episodes per seriesbook isnt ever going to be enough to show everything that happens in the books after the raid where joren dies i was a bit worried that the show wouldnt be able to capture any battle scenes without it looking like crowd runs screen left crowd runs screen right but it sees that they are using subtlety to convey them rather than a lotr style  i particularly liked the pacing of this episode as some of the earlier ones looked a bit rushed whereas some scenes here had enough room to breath tyrion  lancels for one charles dance is perfect as tywin  but hes always good isnt he last seasons deerskinning was class acting and looked completely realistic id be interested to know whether it was the real thing "
"42" "MJ1972" 2012-04-25 " grayarea and uninventive name my comparison of joffrey and augustus only regarded the sexual characteristics hbo is attributing to them i would never mention joffrey and augustus in the same breath in any other respect i was merely pointing out that hbo seems to like its rulers sexually deviant attributing characteristics to them which arent supported by historical documents augustus or spelled out in the books joffrey not that theres anything wrong with reinterpreting characters i just find it interesting that they choose to zoom in on this particular aspect personally id be amazed if joffrey were based on caligula i just reread suetonius chapter on caligula and it seems to me that the only things they have in common are cruelty and vindictiveness two things which are hardly unique to them nero anyone "
"43" "MJ1972" 2012-04-25 " theres a least one possible sub plot which she could be used for they may have dropped it completely but if they havent then ros would be obvious replacement ros  alayaya i suppose that would work although ros doesnt strike me as a the kind of girl who would sacrifice herself "
"44" "Bellatrixlestrange" 2012-04-25 " bit late to the party this weekvery glad i recorded this episode rather than watching live as i had to keep pausing every five minutes to explain to the other half who people were and what was happening i have to say i found this the first episode in which having rtb actually puts you at a disadvantage  theres so much compressionelision of events in the various storylines that you keep on going whats he doing there surely that happens later on whos she then not a criticism of the show at all  i thought all the changes were for the better more pacy fewer characters to keep track of and it makes the show more something to be enjoyed independently a comparison might be amcs the walking dead where changes from the comic books kept everyone guessing its a bit odd that roz always gets chosen when there must be hundreds if not thousands of prozzies in kings landing but i agree with previous posters who have commented that having a consistent character helps to make those scenes more engaging as for that scene with joffrey  squicky but very well done  when he first came in to see the whores i thought oh god not more sexposition but then it turned into something else im sure im not the only one who thought joff had something else in mind with that big sceptre and was relieved when roz just used it to whack that poor girl on the backside all in all cracking episode looking forward to seeing how things develop "
"45" "UninventiveName" 2012-04-25 " hmm i suppose this is partially true but i think hbos augustus and joffrey are pretty distinct augustus in rome was calculating emotionally detached and precociously talented at politics and intrigue more than anything augustus seemed to be portrayed as someone who was fundamentally unlikeable with a host of personal issues but an able and skilled ruler who saw the needs of the nation he certainly had a deeply weird attitude towards sex but was not a sadist in the way joffrey has been cast joffrey is also a woefully inept leader who sees no need for subtlety and uses his power primarily to amuse himself in this joffrey is in stark contrast to hbos portrayal of augustus as said above joffrey has far more in common with caligula "

"95" "Woof73" 2012-04-24 " i think the scene with robb was pretty key to our understanding of robert there was no one sawing off feet in roberts vicinity after his victories to tell him how it really was and so he went into kingship as a soldier with little to no consideration of what awaited him there no surprise that the lannisters snaffled him up he retreated from their machinations and sought solace in the bottom of his goblet his martial prowess and disinterest in the lannisters activities is probably what kept him alive for so long it wasnt until someone started poking around into joffreys parentage that the lions were backed into a corner in other news i think im in real trouble here i cant stop the puns the latest is stannis being unimpressed by renlys silly crown the night is dark and full of tiaras seriously help "

"100" "5432Hun" 2012-04-24 " i cerainly agree that the pace of the plot and consequent cuts between locations can make the series relatively difficult to follow my own view is that the writers have done a very good job in rendering such a large and complex story and cast of characters manageable within the constraints of a 10 episode series but by necessity this story is always going to be harder to follow than a more simple narrative otherwise it would need to be reduced down to almost nothing i think there is visual variety between the different locations kings landing is shot in a kind of latesummer afternoon dustiness of muted gold the wall and beyond are a stark excuse the pun contrast of black on white the far east where dany is a harsh yellow desert glare renlys camp is a riot of colour and frippery compared to stanniss court melisandre apart of course but she is consciously depicted as an interloper the distinctions are not as extreme as i take it you would prefer but that works from the point of view of maintaining a consistent level of realism this would be destroyed if stannis turns up for parlay dressed like a latesaxon king while renly turns up in his irridescent green armour from the book looking like a character from malory "

"132" "RhombusBoy" 2012-04-24 " this show is amazing and i side note i would turn straight for natalie dormer what a hottie though i wish they didnt make her take off her clothes as lovely as she is shes a bit above that "
"133" "sunnyone" 2012-04-24 " someone mentioned roz not being in the books much well she isnt in the books at all it irritates me somewhat that any time spent on her is somewhat wasted in that they could spend it on a more interesting character from the books i was going to make that point thanks for doing it for me "

"135" "MZorin" 2012-04-24 " surely magic or sorcery is the use of supernatural powers even in the strange and fantastic world of got isnt the ability to be unharmed by fire and hatch dragon eggs supernatural if it wasnt then loads of people could do it couldnt they daenerys is a true dragon  thats not sorcery thats her nature and is associated with dragons you could just as easily say melisandre is a mysterious priestess and giving birth to shadow babies are part of her nature its not sorcery or magic "

"137" "sunnyone" 2012-04-24 " yes sansa has to go to bed at night knowing that she is totally responsible for her fathers death and the war that has ensued although her mother played a fair part too she must look back to the days when she was such a flighty soppy slip of a schoolgirl and realise how utterly stupid she was then talk about school of hard knocks she must hate herself how can she ever trust anyone again "
"138" "Nocebo" 2012-04-24 " daenerys is a true dragon  thats not sorcery thats her nature and is associated with dragons and dragons are a natural part of the world hence the skulls in kings landing i mean sorcery  spells magic incantatations by people for a purpose i dont have high standards but i do know what sorcery means "
"139" "MZorin" 2012-04-24 " seeing the birth of the shadow baby was gripping  is this the first moment of actual magic weve seen in got so far i cant recall any sorcery from previous episodes you dont think a girl emerging unscathed from the ashes of a funeral pyre with 3 baby dragons counts as sorcery or magic you must have high standards "

"146" "PeachMcGee" 2012-04-24 " for me this episode marked a clear and deliberate departure from the books that actually helped me to sit back and enjoy the adaptation more i have one thought about the adaptation though and id love to hear what others who have and havent read the books think it really struck me last week that briennes armour and cloak werent as deeply blue as i anticipated and again this week when tyrion spoke to meryn and mentioned his white cloak which youd scarcely notice without it being pointed out personally i think it wouldve been great to see the rich splendour of renlys rainbow guard joffreys white cloaks the lannister red cloaks and the gold of the city watch i think ive got that right so that you instantly know who youre looking at although the costumes are really beautiful i think better visual shorthand would really help to differentiate the various tribes making it easier for the audience to follow whos who and what they stand for similarly while the wall and everything over the narrow sea have an obvious visual i feel that giving dragonstone pyke storms endbitterbridgewherever renlys supposed to be and sometimes even kings landing and generally drizzly grey seasidey visual hasnt helped mark out the locations very well yes pyke and dragonstone are dismal islands so theres not much you can do there but for me renly is supposed to represent youth wealth and sensuality so sticking him on a weatherbeaten bit of coast just didnt make sense and the decision to remove the part where renly offers stannis a peach compounds this personally i think the producers have played the visuals a little too subtle and sadly all the kings have become much of a muchness when really they have very different views backgrounds and followers "
"147" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-04-24 " now that joffrey has been crowned it seems he has become the embodiment of lannisterpsycopathy in the show while cersei comes across as being a bit inept rather than an evil manipulator in her own right its going to be interesting to see where this goes in future seasons "
"148" "SarahHughes" 2012-04-24 " yeah i think thats my problem with littlefinger as well i dont know how id view him if i hadnt read the books but i find him a little broadly written on the show i disagree about dany  actually i think one of the interesting things about the show v the books is that the parallels between arya and dany are much clearer and more interesting on tv i felt this episode really rammed that home "
"149" "BlueCalx" 2012-04-24 " it all serves to emphasise what a twisted little abomination of nature he is i think it was reich who suggested that the nature of your conception influences your personality joffs parents are siblings who conceived him in secret it was a furtive twisted immoral little fuck and whaddaya know so is he adapted from rob newman "
"150" "Joemanji" 2012-04-24 " wow if only there were as much talk about the episode as there is pedantry and mewling about the blogs timing this thread might be interesting a fantastic episode for me i wasnt that fond of ep3 but this really kicked into gear as usual tyrion stole the show but bronn sansa tywin arya were also excellent some absolute killer lines that seemed to have been missing in previous episodes littlefinger is one of my favourite characters in the book and there is definitely an aspect of the book character that likes his intelligence to be recognised unlike varys he constantly strengthens his position by being an invaluable master of coin when finances are tight this is a nuance that will probably be lost in the tv version which is a shame joffrey really is despicable what a performance from gleeson incredible but yet again dany does absolutely nothing  ill say no more for fear of spoilers but she is my least favourite character in both books and the tv show at least viserys and drogo made her series one storyline interesting "
"151" "chemsatain" 2012-04-24 " i havent read the books but that might explain why so many posters here and elsewhere write of his mastery of manipulation when it doesnt really stand up to whats on screen notwithstanding perhaps the betrayal of ned stark "
"152" "BlueCalx" 2012-04-24 " thanks i think the scenes with tywin and tyrion mirrored one another quite well stepping in to halt an episode of needless cruelty at the last minute in both cases a stark girl was involved and in both cases the lannister cited practical cosiderations as a reason for leniency though this was more pronounced in the father i guess it makes it clear that tyrion like his father is one of the few characters who is capable of seeing the bigger picture that so many characters are left groping in the dark figuratively speaking is a sign of sophisticated writing in short everybody is just so plausibly human "

"156" "Lauralol" 2012-04-24 " great episode and the hbo team are really moving the pace along whilst keeping the plot relatively uncomplicated good effort the only one tiny weeny bug bear is littlefinger as the only man in westeros with his littlefingers in all the pies yes he does have great influence over the players of the game and yes he was sent to battlebridge on behalf of the lannisters to broker a deal but did he have to meet cat in this episode and declare his love for her despite openly betraying her husband and therefore knowing she would rebuke him really really littlefinger had no part to play in bringing neds bones to cat she receives his bones at her birth place in riverrun littlefinger also doesnt meet cat again after kings landing there was no point to that scene what so ever and was a bit ham fisted in its delivery lf cat i love you sorry about hubby i love you here have his bones ct pulls a knife get out not necessary "

"160" "5432Hun" 2012-04-24 " first impressions i think roose bolton is well cast goft characters are usually best when they avoid caricature  eg sam is a great performance because he conveys a real person who is fat and cowardly rather than billy bunterish fool  and bolton could easily have fallen into this trap by making him at first glance anyway more normal than he is written they avoid it i think the key is to make these character as much as possible real people whose context happens to be wars of kings magic and mysticism "

"167" "Kirjava13" 2012-04-24 " not sure on the casting of bolton obviously its an adaptation and ill grow to lovehate him but roose is really the only character i had a proper mental image for mostly because of the way hes said to sound ie he speaks softly pretty much all the time and people shouldnt pay attention but they do because hes freaking dangerous not sure if this guy nailed that but then i guess he only popped up briefly and well see more of him later "

"185" "5432Hun" 2012-04-24 " my take on the scene was that joff was actually scared of sex he shied away as soon as ros tried to touch him yes i think this is right it was an interesting contrast with his casual machismo in series 1 when he tells sansa that as soon as she has her blood he will put a son in her belly in a way it might be thought of as a bit of a cliche psycho womanhater cant get it up but theyve brought these contrasts out with joff before his cruel bullying of the butchers son followed by an asswhooping from arya and nym it all serves to emphasise what a twisted little abomination of nature he is "

"220" "SarahHughes" 2012-04-24 " fireswan  i addressed this last week and thought it was clear that that was not my intention but on reflection i should simply have changed the headline to irish i certainly never meant the irish actors to be taken as brits not least because my irish father and irish husband would probably kill me but yes point taken and if i pick an irish actor next week ill change the headline sorry "

"230" "samistar" 2012-04-24 " know what you mean but i think the fact that joffrrey is only 14 and presumably a virgin is what made it so chilling and different to that normal stereotype it seems he isnt interested in sex only suffering "

"234" "londonhongkong" 2012-04-24 " your point about tyrion and tywin is well put tyrion is actually the closest to tywin in intellect and nature tywin had to win back the lannister fortune and power from a time when he was humiliated and underestimated tyrion has had to cope with being humiliated and underestimated from birth the sad part is that tywin cannot see that tyrion is his true son primarily because he blames him for the death of his wife when giving birth to him whereas he is brutally aware that both jamie and cersei lack many of the skills to be a ruler "

"240" "MJ1972" 2012-04-24 " sorry to be so blunt but thats utter bullshit his accent is irish and only irish throughout there are many irish accents his is one i cant claim to be an expert on irish accents but i will say that this was the first episode where gillen struck me as having a real irish accent in previous episodes he was as others have pointed out rather inconsistent sounding english in one line and irish in the next he even sounded like he was trying to overcome an american accent on a few occasions episode 4 was the first in season 2 where he struck me as having a consistent accent  a consistently irish one its almost as if the directors pulled him aside and said look this english accent of yours is not working lets just forget about the accent and focus on acting instead with a little bit of luck hell stick with his native accent now as opposed to putting on the inconsistent accent of episodes 1 2 and 3 "

"307" "Kat917" 2012-04-23 " a brutal whipping as you put it is one thing my take on this scene was that something much worse than a brutal whipping was in store though i think it was a good episode in many ways that scene along with the harrenhal torture makes it the first episode that i probably will not want to watch again "
"308" "testure" 2012-04-23 " a total macabre joy this one loved it the first three episodes were beginning to give me the bookish ump to be honest but not only am i bereft of grumbles with this one but im also enamoured again with the shows promise of imagination and scope yes with glimpses of harrenhal qarth and a bastard shadow demon scope is definitely back on the table from the beginning i liked that there was some show of robbs early skirmishes michael mcelhattons voice evoked a shudder before i saw him or recognised him as bolton i dont know what the volantis doctor is all about just yet great first half throne room scene at kings landing – not too sure about joffs open sadism it was intriguing to see him play some sort of power game with tyrion though and it dovetailed nicely and obscenely with his thwarted abuse of sansa surely however the full legitimacy of this scene would only lie in the dwarfs reaction to witnessing the damage as joffrey promised he would how and ever from then on in it was mostly a pageant of lurid highfives to viewers and readers littlefingers treat with catelyn is a contraction of storylines but actually bloody neat and the same can be said for the amory lorch tortures moved to harrenhal xaro xhoan daxos is evidently less of a pussy than he is in the bookswhich is nice and was that the slaver kraznys and the unsullied outside qarth who knows brilliant to see stannis and davos on the prow of the fury and possibly the most difficult and sustaining scene from the book was superbly realised at the end best episode so far in my humble onion and im wont to include season one in that as well "
"309" "wilsbowski" 2012-04-23 " skipping everyones comments just to post my own thoughts first and again ill point out that i have read the books since the first season great episode i think as proven by a decapitated head being hammered onto a spike not showing up in the violence count from my recollection it deviated quite a bit from the books but i dont mind it is its own animal and definitely thriving in my opinion michael mcelhatton wasnt what i expected roose bolton to look like but no other character introduced in season 2 has joffrey is coming across as an even greater bastard in the show well done jack gleeson theres no cure for being a cunt probably my favourite line in the show yet  sadly i think ive had something very similar uttered to me at some point in my life i will now read everyones comments and discover roughly the same probably "

"316" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-04-23 " robb was criticised for his lack of planning by the sexy doctor from volantis he conveniently bumped into on the battlefield however it doesnt seem that dany has much more of a plan –or not one beyond burning everyone flying dragons burning more people sitting on the iron throne and being hailed as rightful queen hurrah i love emilia clarkes performance and its hard not to root for dany given that she started last season with nothing but its also true that hers is power untempered by advice – ser jorah is seemingly too in awe of in lust with her to be effective brutality remains brutality even when uttered by a character you like robbs plan is to avenge his father eject a usurper that threatens the north thus securing his own kingdom and then head for home i wouldnt expect him to have a plan for the succession of the rump seven kingdoms its not as if the north is a hegemonic power whose ruler could expect to play kingmaker similarly with dany shes onehundred percent preoccupied with survival at the moment what plans could she make beyond grasping any opportunity to escape the red waste as for the stance she took at the gates of qarth my guess is that she wished to appear as a queen rather than a supplicant hence she demanded entry rather than using her dragons to barter for it when judging the arguably impetuous threats she made we need to recall that the survival of her people is at stake qarths initial refusal to open its gates was an equivalent threat in the other direction i found joffreys torture scene incredibly difficult to watch personally i think it went to far and i dont think im what you might call a violence prude a brutal whipping as you put it is one thing but what was implied once the macesceptre came out was more of a bludeoning that must end with broken bones serious internal injury and maybe permanent disability or death overall the number of horrific scenes in this episode made it go by very slowly for me  the opposite of what i usually experience with this show "

"391" "singist" 2012-04-23 " actually on reflection i did find that sexy volantine surgeon scene clunky the dialogue was a bit too obviously lets set up some love interest for robbish i prefer more amputation with my exposition but i will forgive the episode this one chink in its armour for the rest of it was totally awesome "

"394" "singist" 2012-04-23 " do you think dipping his wick will cure him theres no cure for being a cunt this was a fantastic episode so much better than last weeks in my humble opinion very exciting dark and malevolent the man that played the interrogator at harrenhal made my skin crawl the way he casually ate an apple whilst nodding commands to the torturer and what a very room 101 method of torture joffrey as sarah says was spectacularly horrific the whore scene was terrifying it didnt feel like there was point at which he would think he had gone too far the fact that as an adolescent he would shun carnal pleasure entirely for violence and pain just goes further to prove what a little psychopath he has become harrenhal was as spooky as quarth was magnificent and great to see their addition in the opening credits great great great "
"395" "CoombsBucket" 2012-04-23 " ive created an account just to post on this blog so here goes joffrey as usual was difficult to watch making the episode uncomfortable viewing as it should be even before we got to shadow babies i liked littlefinger better in this episode though his accent is still all over the place i really wish aiden would do either his english or go full irish this halfway between thing is odd and somewhat off putting considering hes such a good actor normally how could you not mention cats massive fight with littlefinger by the way all in all a good episode plenty of dany which made me very happy "
