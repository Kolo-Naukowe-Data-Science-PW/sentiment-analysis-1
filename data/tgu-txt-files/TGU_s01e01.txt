"2" "godlikegenius" 2011-04-25 " i am not a big fan of epic fantasy and so have not read the books but i really enjoyed the opening of this series a great deal i will certainly be watching the next episode this evening "
"3" "EddieLarkin" 2011-04-25 " as always with fantasy i find it hard to grasp any sense of history to the world or characters any sense that it or they might have existed any time other than the present setting or any sense of future possibility if there is one thing these characters have in the books is very detailed histories this will hopefully be conveyed in the show as well but youll need to keep watching "
"4" "Sunburst" 2011-04-24 " so far the show seems fairly generic how funny so far you mean after only one episode my youre impatient stick with it as someone who has read the books i can promise you itll be worth it the books only got better more imaginative more absorbing more brilliant with every chapter and so too will the series with every new episode this was just the pilot the introduction of the main characters and the story the tamest part of the whole narrative its going to get deeper and darker and messier and far more spectacular you aint seen nothing yet "
"5" "elsmallo" 2011-04-24 " ive not read the books and was fairly unimpressed by my first viewing i watched it again and found more to like the fan has as much right as any to comment on these shows but not more than anyone else and i think forums like this end up dominated by them because to me at least so far the show seems fairly generic fantasy stuff and certainly not the mature and groundbreaking material the hype suggested as always with fantasy i find it hard to grasp any sense of history to the world or characters any sense that it or they might have existed any time other than the present setting or any sense of future possibility and it takes a bit more than tits and beheadings to make the thing mature were totally inundated with this stuff ill give it a chance though maybe ill get used to the tits and violence and stuff "

"7" "sharpeiboy" 2011-04-23 " smartymcflyb that is a good review you point out there do seem to be a lot of people out there who are really enthusiastic about both the books  the tv series so far cant remember so many positive remarks being made about any series ever regarding this point i think this is why the books are mentioned so much even though i know this blog is about the tv version "
"8" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-04-23 " moretears there are a lot of comments like that ive just spent 5 mins trying to locate the various threads in wicnet  but with the show just out it is difficult to dig them out again especially given their comment structure  which is not typically forum based there are quite a few knockers of the accents out there must admit it is my assumption that they are americans but that is not a bad assumption since i read them on monday morning and the show had only been broadcast in the us at that point a few of the previewreviews also raised concerns over the accents believe me the comments are there and a motivation seems to be a lack of us actors in the show do a google search  youll soon see the concerns 2 seconds pulled this one up httpwwwbadassdigestcom20110417tvreviewgameofthronesepisode11winteriscoming includes concerns over jaimes accent also the main one peter dinklage is an undoubtedly talented actor but the haughty english accent he gives tyrion is so overdone and the characters enunciation is so overthetop that it is at times distracting  by mo ryans review "
"9" "ellipsis10" 2011-04-22 " i think a lot of the negative criticism from the us stems from the fact that everybody has an english accent thank god one thing that would have ruined the tv series is the thought of everyone speaking as though theyd just auditioned for the wire what criticism such as it iswas which isntwasnt much ive read is more to do with the assumption that westeros is just code for britain ie the north bean being yorkshire and the south most everyone else being the home counties et al when in fact its a wholly fantastical place deliberately geographically vague youre more likely to hear criticsm of dialects when you have british or australian actors attempting to americanize their speech and of course the opposite is true in both tv and film the wire and the walking dead come to mind as well as almost the entire cast of cold mountain as much as i love the first two the speech patterns are off putting as for the latter they rendered the film treatment of an iconic american novel unwatchable "
"10" "sharpeiboy" 2011-04-22 " havent made a note of all the internet sites that ive trawled to looking for criticisms of the tv show perhaps you could since you seem to take such an exception to my throwaway commentin short i dont believe any americans object to british accents being used in game of thrones actually some do generalurko36 good point that somebody brought up earlier on this thread one problem is that that tv show comes with a lot of prior baggage unlike most adaptations for the small screen taken from books these volumes are some of the best prose  plotting in 200 years forgive my enthusiasm  the first thing that people who have read the books are going to write about is the fact that the production team seems to be happy to equal martins output in a visual way rather than a personal booktypeofway many of us watching have never  will never read the book was this meant to be dismissive the interesting virtue of democracy is that most people have minority opinions unless youre a tory troll in the pages of the guardian that minority opinion is just as valid as the current groupthink no "

"13" "MoreTears" 2011-04-22 " smartymcfly okay but i asked about evidence of americans criticizing the choice to go with british accents in the show  something rather different than viewers of unspecified nationality having various accentrelated complaints in short i dont believe any americans object to british accents being used in game of thrones "
"14" "generalurko36" 2011-04-22 " really enjoyed this but i hope this blog doesnt continually make comparisons between the book  the tv show many of us watching have never  will never read the book so do not care about inconsistencies  please refrain from spoilers you people who have already read the books remember this is a blog about the tv show only "
"15" "Berzerker" 2011-04-22 " hansomcab why do good actors such as sean bean take on these sordid productions is it for money they should be ashamed some of sean beans earliest tv work was in 1993 as the gardener in lady chatterleys loverwhich was produced by gasp the bbchahahaha fckin awesome  anyway i think its a bit late in the day for such moral highground well it is for him and im sorry i have to address this hbo has led the way with this filth via sparticus now we are regaled with even more visual and titilating viewing sky atlantic has to take some of the blame spartacus blood  sand was a starz production not hbo and spartacus gods of the arena is being broadcast on sky 1 not sky atlantic all im saying hansom is if youre gonna aim for a mindset of scruples or lack thereof then aim true fella and get yer friggin facts straight "
"16" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-04-22 " moretears there are a number of boards where criticisms have been made about accents the one the bears the brunt is dinklages british accent  and a more general one about a mix of regional accents being present i dont have those concerns at all  but they are out there "
"17" "MoreTears" 2011-04-22 " sharpeiboy where can i find these criticisms from americans about the british accents in truth from the way you worded your statement it sounds like you havent heard of any americans criticizing the choice to go with british accents and are just speculating that americans are upset about said accents "
"18" "sharpeiboy" 2011-04-22 " one great difference ive just thought of is that in the books sorry a lot of the characters are shown as ridiculously young really pupils at junior school these days  they act  speak as though they are grown up and thank the 7 gods they do but that is one different point in the tv series even daenarys is in fact the equivalent of a 5th former now so her reactions to khal drogo make sense only if she has been deprived of any teenage nudgewink  has been totally dominated by her brother who seemed pretty rational in the episode despite being pretty crazy from the start in my memory sarahwseeing the difference between rape  necessary consent in the whole world of westeros in every level of society especially the nobility one thinks that one is not treading the streets of london ec1 even with sansa stark one has to think that their parents set it up well in advance i think a lot of the negative criticism from the us stems from the fact that everybody has an english accent thank god one thing that would have ruined the tv series is the thought of everyone speaking as though theyd just auditioned for the wire "
"19" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-04-21 " just posting again to add to the great comment replies to dandelionz post sarahhughes i too pronounce arya in that way  like the musical term  aria "
"20" "SarahHughes" 2011-04-21 " sharpeiboy  i always pronounced it aria rather than arya i am always wrong on the pronunciation of names dandelionz  great comment i felt that she went with him because she had no choice and that she clearly feels violated by what occurs but believes she has no choice because she has grown up alone with only her insane brother for guidance i think the scene walked a very fine line and for all drogos gentler touches still seemed to fall more on the side of rape than consent to me i think you have a point about the ritualised nature of the wedding scene and generally its great to see so many people who enjoyed it and havent read the books i think its an interesting start and one that will hopefully continue to build strongly "
"21" "judierudie" 2011-04-21 " fantasy stuff is not usually my bag it always brings to mind 20 sided dice and dungeons and dragons so i hadnt read the books watched it due to the strength of the cast and have to admit i was mightily impressed its got me hooked straightaway which is damn good going considering id heard others say it was a bit of a slow burner if you want slow burning watch the first 3 hours of boardwalk empire cant wait for next monday now and may just read the books "
"22" "sharpeiboy" 2011-04-21 " dandelionz what a good comment questions1 at least other other person has seen it as right the sex is ritualised but not the killing odd that nobody has commented on the latter while frothing at the former nowt so queer as folk 2 no yes good excellent maybe  wait until you see the future as for brandon ill tell you in july "
"23" "Dandelionz" 2011-04-21 " as total newcomer to the series i thought it was an excellent start to whats evidently a series with a huge amount of depth and detail that they have to try and cram the basics of into only an hour also despite a couple of people complaining about teasers id like to say thanks to all the other commenters for not giving spoilers  those teasers dont really count its not like it means anything to those of us that dont know couple of questionsthe main bone of contention seems to be daenerys  drogos weddingtwo thoughts1 the impression i got from the debauchery of the gathering itself was that all the various uhh romping going on was for display and not actual romping given that not one of the men ever bothered to so much as fiddle with his trousers and given that they werent exposed when they turned around 2 seconds later i figured it was a sort of tribal wedding display of sex rather than actual sexmaybe this is a lot more specific in the book but really i took most of that to be more of a kind of pantomime of acts rather than the acts themselves 2 their later consummation and the willingness of daenerys and the roughness of drogoeither the version i saw was cut or im interpretting things differently hereif they wanted to portray him as rough and genuinely taking her unwillingly then having him slowly and gently removing her clothes is an odd way to do itsure she wasnt exactly cheerful about her situation but she willingly followed him away from the wedding without a word of complaint or any physical resistance similarly she offered no resistance beyond softly spoken words when they were alone and its quite possible that he has no idea what shes saying at all so that didnt mean a lot of course this may turn out to be false and he might have understood her perfectly but thats not clear at the moment at leastthe only resistance she gave was a general wish to not have to do this and if i remember rightly that was only to her brother she seemed either totally resigned or compelled to acceed to her brothers wishes the scheming lunatic that he appears to be and went willingly no matter how much she might have not have actually wanted toactually i rather got the impression that any personality of hers mustve been subjugated in the past as she seems mostly vacant at the moment i hope and assume that that improves throughout the story from drogos point of view he was similarly doing what he would have expected presumably by their custom but was treating her gently with at least a modicum of dignity anyhoo long comment sorry about that but at this stage as someone with no knowledge of the books whatsoever thats how it seemed the show itself excellent i particularly loved the title sequence like a proper homage to that most enduring of fantasy tropes  the map at the front of the book all in all highly anticipating the rest of the series at the moment and at the moment im torn between whether brandon is dead or going to be crippled and resentful as he grows up probably the first but im hoping for the second "

"25" "martin77" 2011-04-21 " hansomcab  censorship is long overdue and will inevitable come back it needs to otherwise our western based society and its values will lack any moral credibilty at all  what a brilliantly funny daily mail type comment have you got any more  "
"26" "adz8" 2011-04-21 " decent enough first episode i have no knowledge of the books but i can see some interesting characters developing sean bean is typically strong and convincing as a leader and im particularly impressed by mark addy these were the only two who seemed in any way natural with the dialogue too often with these medieval middleearth type programmes or like lotr for example the dialogue is so rigid and unconversational and this was no exception disappointingly the pentos scenes looked horrible and although the intention is i assume to create a contrast between there and winterfell it was overdone so looks tacky and fake the nudity is at times gratuitous and although i have no moral objection it is often distracting also when nudity is actually required to create a sexual or intimate moment this is lost due to its overuse in other scenes costumes are excellent and i look forward to more scenes around the spectacularly created wall "
"27" "sharpeiboy" 2011-04-21 " ive read various comments about aryas name ive always pronounced it as on the tv how else could it be pronounced like urea westerose or westerross real question this this is almost like watching in retrospect the very first episode of buffy sorry or the sopranos knowing that it will stretch out for years and years "
"28" "sarabanda" 2011-04-21 " great comments everyone though not as many as id have expected i guess thats what you get for a show being shown on sky  what will we do when mad men also jumps ship later this year anyway my two cents big huge massive lover of the books beginning a reread as we speak and all in all i am quite satisfied with the results so far 1st episodes of anything are never a masterpiece and i dont judge a series by them with the exception of frasier sharpei boy know what you mean by having waited all your life for this the only minor quibble i have with the episode is the tower scene with bran being pushed it felt slightly rushed and how aryas name is pronounced at first i thought the person who said it had a speech impediment definitely getting the boxset when it comes out "
"29" "EddieLarkin" 2011-04-20 " hmm i think orgies and deaths are referenced in the books as occuring at dothraki weddings but maybe you dont read about them directly and although tyrion isnt introduced that way in the book it is a major point of his character that he uses prostitues a lot so id consider it more of a deleted scene from the books rather than an invention its not really enough to just say hes a bit sex mad show dont tell the ending scene though and the dany and drogo scene are in the book "
"30" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-04-20 " eddie  i would beg to differ take solace in the fact that the sex scenes were taken directly from the book not just added in for the sake of upping the viewership though im sure they couldnt have hurt it sorry  gonna have to ref the books here the scene of tyrion with the prostitutes at winterfell is not in the book  and that was the bulk of the boob count cant believe i just used the 2 words the wedding scene  i dont recall reference to the orgy that was going on either sure there is sex in the book most of it plot centred not always though  i really felt they pushed the sex for the first episode for the sake of it "

"40" "sharpeiboy" 2011-04-20 " last comment underflow have thought the books sorry again have such depth and subtlety that the odd scene later in the series explains any mystery early on no scene can be understood without a mass of backstory that explains why people do what they do  who they do it to a virtue in seeing the inevitable boxed set in one sitting undoubtedly a great advantage in g r r ms way of writing which has really been prominent in the series such as it is so far  is that there is no victorian novel sort of writing that sums up a character in 3 paragraphs as soon as she appears you really have to immerse yourself in that world  hope that you understand it better in a few weeks sorry to have been typing so so much have been waiting for this to appear on the screen for most of my adult life  it is so far even better than my highest expectations night "
"41" "Underflow" 2011-04-19 " my hope is that hbo can rectify the problems with martins series  disjointed plot lines and commerically the length of time between books on the plus side like steven erikson martin has delivered characters that dont sit firmly on the side of good or evil  when stuff heats up later in the series i hope hbo plays this aspect for all its worth for me the first episode while giving out a good dose of information necessary for the back story it failed to explain the initial death  and the family connotations  that set the plot moving theres actually more sex and nudity than i remembered from the book but having watched rome and spartacus it remains retatively on the tame side overall i know its good because im part way through watching the episode again "

"62" "SarahHughes" 2011-04-19 " werthead  its an interesting argument because i never felt of it as down played in the books what i thought was that we saw everything from danys point of view and she was terrified and followed her brothers belief that drogo was a savage and then was surprised by the fact that he wasnt what shed expected the problem is that i dont think you can pull that trick off on a tv show very easily because youre not in the characters heads as much i certainly do think theyre going to struggle to move the relationship on believably after such a brutal start "
"63" "SarahHughes" 2011-04-19 " masterstroke  im not sure how to address this in the blog  and admittedly im guilty of it at one point in my post for which i apologise i do think we should try and discuss it apart from the book ie does it work on its on as a standalone show for my part i think so but id be interested to know what others thought alcockell  the first episode could certainly have done with being a little longer boardwalk empire got a feature length start after all just because theres so much to explain i think it would work well watched all in one block certainly although thats only based on how detailed episode one is everyone ok nudity count it is next week i agree that it seems a little gratuitous in parts sharpelboy im sorry i thought it was still obscure enough not to matter plus there are two other possible arguments but in retrospect misjudged oh yes and the other scene i should have singled out because i thought it was really well done was the part between ned and robert in the family tomb addy and bean struck just the right amount of rueful nostalgia for what might have been "
"64" "Werthead" 2011-04-19 " i havent read the books so come to the tv series clean of all that i have one question is the sex in the book as nasty as shown last night as mentioned elsewhere this is a big departure from the books where the drogodany relationship is hands down the most controversial point of discussion between fans the relationship is deliberately played ambiguously raising questions about consentbutbeingpressured the age of consent in a medievalesque society versus our own and so on but in the book the author arguably backpedals a little bit on the unpleasant aspects of the arranged marriage by having dany get into it a bit and be attracted to drogo in the tv series theyve decided to treat it more brutally ive seen mixed reactions to this some feel that the author undersold the scene in the book by trying to make it as nice as it could be under the circumstances rather unusually for him it has to be said and others think that by making this relationship apparently more unpleasant and abusive from the start it makes it much harder to come back from i really really hope that the book crowd and their continual spoilers go away this is going to be a problem on all sites that cover the series especially since you also have tv viewers asking bookreaders for clarifications of certain points which may then spoil the books if they decide to read them later and its an area where the tv series goes in a different direction its easy enough to avoid spoiling future developments but its difficult to know where to draw the line when talking about backstory or motivations "
"65" "masterstroke" 2011-04-19 " i really really hope that the book crowd and their continual spoilers go away "
"66" "TAFKAJamie" 2011-04-19 " macster the bath scene is i think actually toned down from the relevant scene in the book where viserys is a bit more handson and i suspect will also serve as visual prefiguring of a key scene for daenerys later in the series not in reply to you specifically i also think that the rougheningup of the first danydrogo sex scene is there to allow his character to have some kind of story arc softening towards dany as the show progresses cos he doesnt really get much to do in the book thought the changes that were made were largely quite sensible ones and that the general presentation of story elements is rather smart  at this point in the book you know or you think you know roughly as much as viewers of the series should "
"67" "hellcat" 2011-04-19 " i agree with those asking for a tit count not least because most of the nudity except for dany and khal drogos wedding night seemed calculated and gratuitous shit guys its an hbo show without a bumshot cautiously optimistic so far though the plot was much too busy but given the source material i think that was necessary bean addy and dinklage are predictably terrific kudos to the kid playing arya as well the kid playing joffrey is perhaps too obviously punchable im a fan of the books but not of daenaerys targaryen i felt sorry for her in the beginning but any and all layers of personality have been gently exfoliated from her lovely hide a word of praise for emilia clarke though shes nothing like as annoying as her character "
"68" "macster" 2011-04-19 " thought the scene at the wedding was toned down from the book but otherwise the sex seems to have all been turned up a bit  i thought the bath scene was nothing but gratuitous still not as gratuitous or as stupid as spartacus though still if i remember the books correctly it should tone down a bit for the next few episodes on the whole its well done well put together wellperformed now weve got to wait for the plot to kick into gearas usual with hbo shows "
"69" "DrPretorius" 2011-04-19 " apologies i made an error myself i mean that hbo didnt make spartacus though obviously it wasnt sky either "

"71" "sharpeiboy" 2011-04-19 " giggsyschesthair the books have a lot of 13th14th century influences with notions of chivalry  honour  peasants  villeins women were perceived as potential marriagepartners quite a lot of prostitutes but that is par for the course if you have a lifeview of one of the major houses plus ca change i think cirsei doesnt like this status quo but as yet can do little about it look at her sideways glances at her husnand the king michelle fairley was perfect in the books i found it difficult to give her a face but no longer "
"72" "alcockell" 2011-04-19 " im one of those who only has freeview  and was hoping this was going to come onto the bbc or channel 4 but am waiting for the dvds or for hbo to consider a deal with seesaw to enable a wider audience linux users etc to stream the content independent of sky cos playout clients based on iplayer tech work better on a wider range of kit  sorry rupert but the beeb is way ahead of you there from what i have read it would appear that there are likely to be quite long previously on chunks at the top of each episode consequently might there be call for hbo to splice each series into effectively a multidisc feature film similar to how columbia did with das boot when the full series was released on disc 6hour series turned into about a 5hour film considering that i saw battlestar galactica off the dvds i watched the whole series over 23 days or offer that mode of traversing each disc cos if its going to be that immersive it sounds like the kind of thing id want to watch in one hit thoughts "

"75" "Gups" 2011-04-19 " giggsy i think there were three sex scenes in the show last night tyrion the dwarf and the prostiute whcih didnt seem that nasty to me but i dont recall being in the book cersei the queen and jaime nasty in the sense that its incestous but not otherwise and drogo and daenerys the last appeared as rape in the show but in th ebook she is initially scared but he treats her very gently and intercourse is consensual this was probably the biggest departure from the book in yesterdays episode thats not to say that there isnt a lot of unpleasant descriptions of rape etc in the books "
"76" "Corrective" 2011-04-19 " thought it was very well done and as someone with no knowledge of the books i loved the final scene brilliantly dark and unexpected and a good sign of things to come cant believe some commenters comparing it unfavourably to spartacus on dialogue acting direction design scope story action and pretty much any other area you want to measure game of thrones looks infinitely better than the juvenile sub300 crapfest that is spartacus "
"77" "giggsyschesthair" 2011-04-19 " i havent read the books so come to the tv series clean of all that i have one question is the sex in the book as nasty as shown last night while im not on the same wagon as hansomcab  the level of sex and violence was to be expected  i am disappointed because it left me feeling a lot of the sexual content were just the fantasies of the writers and producers i mean in creating a new fantasy world is it really essential that everyone does it doggystyle i dont mind nudity either but it would help keep it in context if there was an equal amount of male bits dongling around instead it was all about the tits which is unwanted distraction against what was a great setup of an interesting family i thought michelle fairley almost stole the show and a beautiful backdrop so great to see northern ireland showing off its beauty on a world stage like this tits cant show you what a character is really feeling or change an atmosphere they are by their very nature titilating and should be saved for such seldom moments and only when it forwards the story see melanie griffith in nobodys fool with paul newman otherwise they just get in the way i loved the pace  it wasnt nothing like as frantic as i was expecting  and am really looking forward to the next episode i am confused about the differing attitudes towards love and sex by the different houses ned and his wife seem to have a genuinely loving consensual relationship while everywhere else it seems expected that women can be whored one way or another maybe later episodes will reveal the balance of power i hope "

"82" "quipu" 2011-04-19 " and by mark addis i meant mark addy obviously "
"83" "quipu" 2011-04-19 " good stuff i think a lot of my satisfaction stems from the fact that hbo did not make a complete travesty of the material yes there was a whole load of exposition but short of employing cate blanchett to give some ghostly narration at the start of the show its going to be unavoidable having the cast fill in the gaps highs sean bean peter dinklage and mark addis were excellent as ned tyrion and robert baratheon there was also good work from all the stark kids emilia clarke as daenerys was also good but for me the acting plaudits have to go to harry lloyd as the sneering sleazy viserys he really did a great job of bringing the character to life also peter mannion is apparently playing power games with exiled royalty and horse riding barabarians lows accents seem to be a little all over the shop agreed that the pentos sequences were all a little bit too clean and glossy it looked like a particularly graphic timotei advert in places really in a world where spartacus blood  tits exists i think the bar for barbarism has been raised "

"86" "candylilacs" 2011-04-19 " the actress who played daenerys was not chubby at all she did have a horrible camera angle from behind try filming yourself from behind where the screen cuts your behind in half at the widest point and see how big your butt looks she has a normalgirl body type  modest bosom bigger hips however i do hope the actress gets to wear more clothes as the program progresses it seems theres tons of female nudity but no men take off their clothes hardly fair and since no one has said it  jason momoa  damn even his scowling is hot "

"88" "Chojinalpha" 2011-04-19 " people dont feed the troll sorry to sound like a 13 year old boy but we are missing a nudity count here as part of the blog i loved it the whole thing it is so nice to have a tv series that feels like it was made for me the books are very personal but the whole adaptation feels like having a conversation with someone else about their own interpretation of the novels like when you read a book at the same time as your firends its fun to see what works and what doesnt i wasnt dissapointed by anything other than it ended after an hour i would have made daeny not quite so chubby though she does havw a big bum shes a willowy girl in my head stoic with a frail body and iron mind moar please "
"89" "ishouldbewriting" 2011-04-19 " ive not read any of the books shame on me i know but i thought immediately that theres more to drogo and dany than meets the eye  he was every bit as beastly as she feared and because she seemed to expect that its what he gave herhowever i think she has more steel and hes more of a thinker than he seemsit was shocking yes but there was ambiguity there imoit wasnt all glum either the look ned gives robert in response to the fat jibe was pretty funny hansomcab dont watch then i find loads of stuff offensive and in extreme moments would cheerfully take people who enjoy strictly x factor and bgt outside stick them against a wall and open up with a machine gun and dont even get me started on supposed comedies and the imo waste of 3045 minutes that is songs of praisehowever it takes all kind to make a world one mans meat is another mans poison etcso i simply choose not to watch or get too involved in anything to do with things i dislike its by far the simplest and best optionanyway come on thereve been previews and trailers and enough info for you to have an idea of what game of thrones was about and more than enough hbo output for you to know what to expect "

"92" "mixermac" 2011-04-19 " i think the comments made by hansomcab are way over the top anybody who watches sky tv in whatever package is paying for it it is amazing that people who are disgusted by certain scenes on television forget about the ability they have to change channels or knock the bloody thing off hbo may or may not be pleased with being credited with making spartacus it was actually made by starz tv in the us these two channels along with others are the only ones who are making entertainment for an adult audience they have hits and misses but at least they try spending vast amounts of money in the process a quick look at whats on in your local cinema will reveal the dearth of anything approaching what might be called adult entertainmenti was not overly impressed by game of thrones but i will give it a few more chances glad to see during the ads that in treatment with gabriel byrne is coming soon always something to look forward to "
"93" "Kulturtrager" 2011-04-19 " come the credits roll i sat there thinking thank the stars that that such a great example of fantastical fiction has been treated with even a modicum of care too often great novels are adapted as if they were mere notes on a napkin to be realised in a far better manner hbo deserve truckloads of praise for going beyond the call of the profit margin and truly delivering martins vision but some notes to be made in the margins why alter khal drogos behaviourwhy remove the ambiguity of jaimes actionsand i was hoping that the sets and costumes of winterfell while marvellous to be grittier more wornbut yes minor points i think the heart of the series will come when we move to the wall there lies the richest source of visual drama "

"102" "Lalwende" 2011-04-18 " that was great  the right cast and one that was surprising eg alfie allen works as theon id not expected that i liked how the northerners had northern accents even if they were generic though maybe the karstarks will sound geordie if you think this might have been a slow start thats how the books are martin wrote them so that readers gradually move across this world and it opens up around them if the tv series is going to mirror the pace of the books then as it goes on it will pick up incredible speed and complexity i cant wait "

"104" "Wormwoody" 2011-04-18 " indifferent im afraid i loved the books but the first episode was wooden and stilted im really hoping it grows into itself an earlier article in made reference to spartacus both series of this were hugely and enjoyably over the top truly if you want to claim game of thrones as the sopranos with swords then spartacus got there first and so far has done a much more convincing job "
"105" "SimonEssex" 2011-04-18 " im a big fan of the books and it was as good a start as i could have hoped it appears to have been cast perfectly only sandor clegane  the doghelmed knight  seemed a little off but to give him credit that was only from one scene my only major gripe was with that wedding scene you mentioned  it certainly looked less consensual than it is in the book  and changes our view of drogo  hope thats addressed in later episodes so only one small misstep from an adaptation ive been waiting for for ages i cannot wait to see the next one theres so much to look forward to i hope those not familiar with the books stick with it until it can build all those delicious dark layers "
"106" "Styllian" 2011-04-18 " good solid start but danys story definitely feels too removed from the main thrust of the story the cast is shaping up to be fantastic and the sets are amazing ive been waiting for this for the last 18 months or so and it didnt disappoint in episode one "
