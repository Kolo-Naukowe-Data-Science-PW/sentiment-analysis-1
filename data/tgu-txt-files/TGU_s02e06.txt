"1" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-13 " ive always wondered just what makes daenerys so sure that anyone in westeros would want to see her on the iron throne surely theyd all be pretty wary of being ruled by a young untried girl who knows nothing of the place or people involved i think shes living in cloud cuckoo land also with regard to the dothraki hordes conquering westeros for her khal drogo was most unwilling to cross the sea what do they call it they think its poison dont they and only agreed to do so just before he died now his khalasar has melted away leaving dany with the very few who survived the red desert and reached qarth with herwell it all becomes something of a moot point imho its never going to happen isnt it ser jorah mormont that has given her the idea that this plan has legs also that one ship would be sufficient as she could raise support once she has arrived sarah has previously mentioned jorahs obsessive love for his khaleesi but is it maybe that hes actually now rather homesick and would like to settle down with her and her dragons in some country cottage however he appears to have been dispatched by her in irritation since there was no sign of him this week "
"2" "glitterfairy11" 2012-05-13 " thanks to the people who suggested other forums i think the twop one seems closest in tone to this although its still not the same i wish we could have this blog twice one with and one without spoilers the others seem a lot less tongue in cheek than most people are here "
"3" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-13 " i think you may be setting way too much store by the effectivenes of plate armour here i think although am by no means certain that the mongols did face numerous forces where the enemy were heavilly armoured and their horse back archers dealt with them without issue didnt they invade much of eastern europe and make it as far as vienna under ghengis its quite possible that im wrong in this regard my memory for history is a little hazy armour was not developed and deployed at great expense by westerh european armies if it did not do the job it was designed for it was effective climate was a big factor in muslim armies using lighter armour which was better suited to the middle east the mongols were an invading force and they got no further than vienna  the edge of western europe it was the frankish and german armies of the time that best utilised heavy armour and tactics  the eastern european for example the polish were not so heavily protected the mongols were never able to penetrate the european interior also the mongols did have heavier armed lancers to complement the archers so it was rarely a case of just lots of horse archers being able to defeat armoured troops "
"4" "wickedripeplum" 2012-05-13 " if you want another spoiler free place to discuss the show might i recommend the completely unspoiled speculation thread at twop its highly moderated for your show watching only pleasure the rest of the board is obviously varying degrees of not safe "
"5" "pillroad" 2012-05-13 " as regards armour  it is possible for a lightly armed man to defeat a heavily armoured man  for example i think the fight between bron and the kinight in the eyrie was done believably but i dont really believe its feasible that all the dothraki are as good as bron no race could produce that many people of such skill if that was the case think how good they would be if they had armour but if you look at the history of warfare a big part of it is technological advances the knights of the 15th century were vastly technologically superior to the knights of the 11th century plate armour and even partial plate was superior in terms of protection and mobility to the heavy chainmail hauberks and their associated heavy padding underneath that were worn at the battle of hastings by the late 15th century the knights were so well protected they could actually dispense with shields and start wielding two handed swords and axes which would be devastating the heavy plate armour is not as encumbring as people think it actually weighed a lot less for instance than modern soldiers actually carry on their backs in the modern age people who have tried it now talk about being able to do cartwheels in it an army of lightly armed and armoured troops no matter how enthusiastic could never do more than harass such a technologically superior army the dothraki could engage in guerilla type tactics but how long could they keep it up they would never be able to set up a camp or rest for more than a few hours in weseteros because if they stopped for longer the westerosi would obliterate themi i think you may be setting way too much store by the effectivenes of plate armour here i think although am by no means certain that the mongols did face numerous forces where the enemy were heavilly armoured and their horse back archers dealt with them without issue didnt they invade much of eastern europe and make it as far as vienna under ghengis its quite possible that im wrong in this regard my memory for history is a little hazy "
"6" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-12 " actually i can see one potential ally but maybe we should not discuss these things in case they are coming up in the further books  too much temptation for book readers to put in spoilers accidentally "
"7" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-12 " which effectively he was    and whos to say that isnt what he was up to last week    "
"8" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-12 " jorah mormont wasnt present to protect the dragons because hed nipped home  bear island  for a pint in season one i couldnt help feeling that he was always nipping out to make a phone call "
"9" "CharlieBronze" 2012-05-12 " on that map comparison then catelyn and brienne would have travelled from rome to paris no mean feat for a raven remarkable for two unescorted noble women through hundreds of miles of enemy territory book readers would know that they actually travel from bitterbridge to riverrun logistically more straightforward as kings landing and harrenhall are easily avoided but would be similar in distance on the map comparison as travelling from corsica to frankfurt but its a moot point unless it becomes a running gag and in the next episode we learn that jorah mormont wasnt present to protect the dragons because hed nipped home  bear island  for a pint "
"10" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-12 " i cant recall which potential ally has been suggested in the show but i do think its clear that while robert commanded grudging loyalty from his direct bloodfamily apart from that he could only rely on the vale which he lost with the death of jon arryn and on the north he went so far as to tell ned that he had nowhere else to turn "
"11" "badger1969" 2012-05-12 " that does raise another question which i have wondered about  book readers please avoid spoilers if this comes up in later books  and that is are there any housesgroupsfactions in westeros that still hold allegiance or sympathy to the targaryens im not sure if the truth at this point has anything to do with what dany thinks she has been told her whole life by viserys that this is the case and i think magister illyrio also encouraged this view roberts plan to kill her in series 1 was partly out of hatred for the targaryens but there also seemed to be some element of concernfear at news of her pregnancy this suggests he at least thinks that the targaryen claim to the throne might still be a threat one potential ally for the targaryens might be suggested by historical events which have been discussed in the tv series "
"12" "gx11" 2012-05-12 " werent the women of qarth supposed to have one breast exposed we have been cheated "

"14" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-12 " thats an interesting point  yes the addition of the dothraki to a native westeros faction could make them a factor that does raise another question which i have wondered about  book readers please avoid spoilers if this comes up in later books  and that is are there any housesgroupsfactions in westeros that still hold allegiance or sympathy to the targaryens it should appear from what weve seen that there are none  but given time and further conflict the people might welcome them back  once again if this comes up in the further books us tv people do not want to know  "
"15" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-11 " another thing to consider is that a landing of a targaryen heir  40000 dothraki in a welljudged part of westeros could have sparked something bigger meaning the invaders would not have had to rely solely on their own military and logistical resources this might well have been more worrying to robert than the dothraki warriors themselves however it does look as if the way it was written with the king fretting about the 40000 dothraki as if they were an invincible force rather than because of what they might trigger might have been overly simplistic "
"16" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-11 " might make it clear that there were spoilers there and that there is a section on that site for newbies like myself and presumably you who had not read the books so im sorry if you were accidentally exposed to spoilers on that site and should have put a warning a bit more prominently no its ok  no spoiler worries the comments on that site were just one liners and pretty naff that was all thanks for the site reference the preamblecommentary was fine  "
"17" "Dryhtscipe" 2012-05-11 " again no even the basic westerosi infantry units appear to wear at least medium armour to use rpg parlance the only advantage they would hold is sheer numbers being able to overwhelm individuals by simple force of weight not to mention that dothraki horses are likely much less hardy than westerosi horses faster yes but not as heavy or as mean also we have to take into account geography there are an awful lot of chokepoints in westeros where it is incredibly difficult to move armies the neck is just one of those and completely impassable to a massive light cavalry army plus you have the foraging issue they not only have to feed themselves they have to feed the multiple horses for every man they bring with them with winter on the way the only way theyd stand a chance is with dragons "
"18" "Dryhtscipe" 2012-05-11 " the dothraki do not wear any heavy armour of any variety ever they are a mobilitydoctrine army if you like they believe in speed and rather than outright individual strength strength in numbers all indications point to this both in the show and er elsewhere there is also dialogue regarding the dothraki disdain for armour and heavy weapons in the show the dothraki involved is later killed for the very reasons stated his weapon is not sufficient to breach armour but there are an awful lot of dothraki if they can get to westeros in any numbers they would likely hold the countryside which is where all the food is they have no chance of winning any meaningful sieges but then the westerosi would have no food and winter is coming "

"22" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-11 " thats assuming the westerosi actually have large numbers of such knights my bet is that they dont simply from the point of view of the resources to equip them  winterfell only had one weaponsmith as far as i can judge so how many armoured fighting men could realistically be based from there so it could boil down to a conflict between a small number of elite knights supported by large numbers of lesswellequippedtrained infantry levies facing large numbers of mounted dothraki equipped and trained to a decent standard with some elite warriors of their own i reckon the basic dothraki unit would be much more effective than the basic westerosi unit maybe the biggest challenge for the dothraki would be finding enough forage for their mounts "

"27" "PeachMcGee" 2012-05-11 " dont want to get into too much detail on this as im by no means an expert or even a novice but i dont think we have seen the dothraki dressed for warfare yet have we anyone so we dont actually know how heavily armed they would be although i have a feeling dothraki armour would be much lighter than westerosi armour it doesnt mean they have none at all anyway i just wanted to clarify something you raised that i find confusing  your assumption that the dothraki couldnt defeat the heavily armoured soldiers of westeros  doesnt this mean that in conflicts of westerosi vs westerosi no one ever wins or loses because their armour is totally impregnable surely there are pros and cons to both styles also i couldnt comment on the armour in the tv series as its not something i could recognise if i saw it but in the books many of the soldiers do wear chainmail hauberks i only know this as i had to look up hauberk i hope this doesnt come across as an attack just intrigued "
"28" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-11 " ok thanks and apologies thats why i was asking i have read book 1 but not as well as you did  "
"29" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-11 " the last time they were in rebellion against the crown and got smacked down hard this time theyre joining in a civil war which they probably think the north will lose  particularly now that there is another house throwing its weight against them while we saw robbs emotional response to the attack the loss of his secure base  presumable threat to his recruiting grounds and supply lines would be terrible military blows too i thought that the osha nuditysex scene was okay since it won her the freedom of the castle she wouldnt have found it so easy to kill a guard whod been told to keep her under lock and key however that does bring me to a troubling point how come the boys hodor and two very dangerous direwolves were not under lock and key "
"30" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-11 " mmmm the dothraki could cause some problems but i cant see how they could conquer westeros and also dont forget the weather  those bare chested dothraki wouldnt last a week of rainy westeros before fleeing back east d "

"32" "Joemanji" 2012-05-11 " a little pedantic dont you think the discussions i am referring to happen in book one hardly spoiler territory i have deliberately avoided references to anything beyond where we are in tv show and believe me i could have answered some of the other questions on this page alone "
"33" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-11 " was this discussion about the difficulties the dothraki would have in westeros  in the book or in a game  actually relevant to what we have seen so far for example did it take place prior to dany arriving at qarth the conversation about not being able to hide behind stone walls while the peasantry were slaughtered happened in season 1 cant remember between whom though  robert and ned maybe while arguing about whether to assassinate dany "
"34" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-11 " as mentioned the inability of the dothraki to take any castles was dealt with in the book i think was something like either the armies hide in their castles and leave the peasants to the dothraki and dany wins the people round that way or else the nobility march out and dont have walls to hide behind and have to fight the faster moving dothraki on their terms there have been several references by you to the books but at the head of sarahs preamblecommentary she says spoiler alert  we also want to avoid book spoilers i think that does mean blog references should apply only to actionsevents covered in the tv series or that at least precede the timeline reached so far in books 1 and 2 was this discussion about the difficulties the dothraki would have in westeros  in the book or in a game  actually relevant to what we have seen so far for example did it take place prior to dany arriving at qarth "
"35" "Joemanji" 2012-05-11 " the other irritating thing is that it seems that if youre a female a flash of total nudity renders every man a slavering giant phallus is this the case with all straight men or is hbo trying to cater to the teenage boy concealed in all men probably ratings coming to think of it but there is a difference between plotrelated nudity and mere salacious titillation who is this true of other than theon and the patrons of various brothels not ned rejected cersei jon robb or joffrey tyrion always seems in control of his urges too the nudity has been gratuitous but that is not the fault of all men or even the fictional male characters of this show "
"36" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-11 " yes thats exactly my feelings as regards the iron islanders and the size of the north  the north is pretty massive in size  the iron islanders are 30 ships worth of light infantry "
"37" "sharpeiboy" 2012-05-11 " ive always felt a bit ignorant about the iron islands  this series doesnt make things any clearer the north is  possibly  hundeds of times bigger by area  probably by population too so a minor assault on winterfell  a couple of other castles should be seen as a pinprick rather than the equivalent of operation barbarossa the whole scenario is totally believable in the books   probably  the tv series but in real life as it were the whole series of events is a bit like the broadwater farm estate just a hypothetical example declaring war on east anglia this problem of distances is beginning to worry me too i read or saw  cant remember which  that it took robert  his party weeks to get from kings landing to winterfell but littlefinger seems to pop from place to place hundreds of mile apart like harry potter and his instantaneous chimney transport grrm sais that westeros is about the size od south america which muddies the waters even more the other irritating thing is that it seems that if youre a female a flash of total nudity renders every man a slavering giant phallus is this the case with all straight men or is hbo trying to cater to the teenage boy concealed in all men probably ratings coming to think of it but there is a difference between plotrelated nudity and mere salacious titillation terrific episode im just niggling fot its own sakeid be grateful for other views though "
"38" "Joemanji" 2012-05-11 " there are 200000 dothraki they just didnt all follow kal drogo as mentioned the inability of the dothraki to take any castles was dealt with in the book i think was something like  either the armies hide in their castles and leave the peasants to the dothraki and dany wins the people round that way or else the nobility march out and dont have walls to hide behind and have to fight the faster moving dothraki on their terms "
"39" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-11 " d i think it would be more believable if the dothraki horde had been 200000 or even more ravaging the countryside is one thing but they would never have been able to take a single one of the big westeros fortresses or walled cities the mongols were feared because there were so many of them generally they were repelled by the very capable mamluks in the middle east and in europe they made initial gains in the east but were also repelled and their tactics were not successful in pushing into the interior of europe "
"40" "monders" 2012-05-11 " i really want to dust off my warhammer stuff anyone got a spare d6 "
"41" "monders" 2012-05-11 " maybe the westerosi were afraid that their infantrybased armies would not be able to be able to bring the dothraki to battle while the latter ravaged the country at will yeah exactly imfo theyre a hard hitting skirmishing force the strict regimented battle units of the westeros armies wouldnt be able to react qucikly enough the tribes of the vale would give them a good scrap though "
"42" "Joemanji" 2012-05-11 " pretty sure there is some reference to dothraki archers in the book in the got card game there are definitely dothraki horse archers and all references from that come from the book "
"43" "ElDerino" 2012-05-11 " hah you certainly know a lot more than me about these things its an interesting point though  i dont remember anything about whether there is any variety of troop types within the dothraki army and presumably it would be fairly at odds with any real life examples not to have some mixture of archersshock troopswhatever "
"44" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-11 " i generally find the taking of winterfell and also the actions of the iron islanders to be quite confusing this isnt the official actions of the iron islanders is it i thought it was a bit of freelancing by theon egged on by his secondincommand one plot hole in series 1  people can correct me if im wrong  it said that the dothraki horde numbered 40000 unarmoured warriors  that was expected to be a threat to westeros with its larger heavily armed armies  never understood that you make a fair point maybe the westerosi were afraid that their infantrybased armies would not be able to be able to bring the dothraki to battle while the latter ravaged the country at will plus i wonder how cohesive the defence would have been we know theres no royal army since that was one of the reforms joffrey wanted to make the gold cloaks are the closest thing at the moment but they seem more like a thuggish police force the real armies are in the hands of the great houses with the starks being the strongest house at the moment the one winning battles and they only have 20000 men most of whom were presumably working in the fields not so long ago "
"45" "monders" 2012-05-11 " sinequanone  can i just add i am enjoying this discussion immensely and your bit about the mongols abive is very interesting cheers "
"46" "monders" 2012-05-11 " thats a kind of fantasy world idea of warfare it is a kind of fantasy world the idea that one race might be more fearless than another does not belong in the real world  where all human races are basically similar people all over the real ancient world were probably terrified of genghis khan and his lot though theyd never seen them and would be very unlikely to ever cross them his martial prowess is legendary and the mongols were essentially light armoured cavalry units or one fooking massive unit youre assuming that everyone is evenly matched on strength weapon skill toughness etc and just the armour would make a difference i reckon that the dothraki would be schooled in combat from an early age and constantly tested throughout their short brutal lives your average westerosi soldier isnt half as a good a soldier in my opinion and apart from a small number of career soldiers most would be as i mentioned above everyday folk the stories of dothraki savagery are well known in westeros and to see a 40000 plus horde come charging across the horizon would put the absolute shits up any sane bloke certainly the ones at the front of the column and probably the next few rows too and i any case no matter if they are born warriors their swords and bows would be ineffective against westeros armour i doubt that every infantryman would have the luxury of armour and besides look what happened to king harold 0 "
"47" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-11 " the dothraki are pretty similar to the mongols and did they not defeat a lot of more heavily armoured forces not really the mongols were a mixture of light archers and more heavily armoured lancers btw its also a common misconception that plate armour as worn by westeros troops is that burdensome it was actually lighter and of less encumbrance than for example the previous technology of chain mail hauberks "
"48" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-11 " mmmm  i will read the first book soonish perhaps "
"49" "ElDerino" 2012-05-11 " the dothraki are pretty similar to the mongols and did they not defeat a lot of more heavily armoured forces as far as the ironborn strategy goes i think its assuming a lannister victory or at least a defeat for the north the idea is that robb will find it hard to keep his army together once news gets round of their homes being under attack and once that happens the lannisters will be able to destroy them and in that case the lannisters might well grant the greyjoys some of the northern lands partly as a reward and partly to help prevent any future rebellions there it may not look so clever if stannis wins though since he will be very keen to punish anyone who didnt join his side and then theon at winterfell  well we know hes out his depth i doubt he has any great plan for what to do next "
"50" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-11 " thats a kind of fantasy world idea of warfare i thought one of my martins strengths was that his warfare was historically realistic  based on the wars of the roses etc the idea that one race might be more fearless than another does not belong in the real world  where all human races are basically similar and i any case no matter if they are born warriors their swords and bows would be ineffective against westeros armour "
"51" "Joemanji" 2012-05-11 " unarmoured guys even on horseback would be mashed by those relatively hitech fully armoured crossbow armed westeros armies the dothraki are a bunch of schmucks the book does go into a bit of depth regarding how the dothraki would perform should they reach westeros as has been mentioned the crux of it is that there are not actually that many knights and the rest of the soldiers are just peasant conscripts iirc the dothraki didnt really plan to arrange a pitch battle against crossbows and knights but rather pillage and raid the countryside whilst the nobility cowered in their castles thus undermining their political power cant remember fully "
"52" "monders" 2012-05-11 " woof more like meeeeow "
"53" "monders" 2012-05-11 " the thing with the dothraki is that they are all born and raised warriors and fearless the westerosi on the other hand are mainly farmers and peasants called up by their lords and masters to fight knights and smaller forces ie lannisters and starks guradsmen aside there arent really any proper fighters re theon as mentioned above it was a rash on the spot decision to take winterfell not thought through and consequences be damned "

"56" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-11 " unarmoured guys even on horseback would be mashed by those relatively hitech fully armoured crossbow armed westeros armies the dothraki are a bunch of schmucks ok so theon went to all that effort just to ransom the stark children for some gold still seems rather weakhe seems to think he is the prince of winterfell which seems rather pointless so hes sending for 500 more iron islanders just to hold winterfell so they can make some cash  sounds like a big risk with such a large number of the iron islanders fighting strength they had 30 ships didnt they which i wonder means how many soldiers "
"57" "Moetcat8" 2012-05-11 " theon was never meant to take winterfell and every action he takes since he left the iron islands is about keeping face and well "
"58" "Woof73" 2012-05-11 " theon sends for more 500 more men from his delightful sister so i guess hes assuming theyll all pull together and back his daring gambit as for what he can get for winterfell well theres bran and rickon to ransom doh it could be that the dothraki horde would all be on horseback whereas the westerosii are mostly foot soldiers thats pretty scary even if you are wearing a beautifully wrought iron bucket on your head danis horde greatly amuses me at the moment there are what four of them "
"59" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-11 " i generally find the taking of winterfell and also the actions of the iron islanders to be quite confusing ie as coastal raiders in ships which means light footsoldiers what do they hope to conquer and hold in the north against the massive northern army of robb which could always return likewise how does theon expect to hold winterfell and even if he could the only use would be to bargain for something  like what i dont really see the point of the iron islanders actions unless they are working with the lannisters have not read books so not doing spoilers  perhaps these questions will be resolved or maybe they are just plot holes one plot hole in series 1  people can correct me if im wrong  it said that the dothraki horde numbered 40000 unarmoured warriors  that was expected to be a threat to westeros with its larger heavily armed armies  never understood that yes i am a medieval warfare geek "

"61" "ElDerino" 2012-05-11 " the other thing about tyrion is that though hes secured his position well for now hes living on borrowed time there are two possible outcomes to the war and neither are good for him either stannis wins  in which case his head ends up on a spike or the lannisters win  in which case tywin returns to kings landing to take over as hand and regent a life at court with a king who hates him and a regent who despises him wouldnt be too appealing and it would only get worse when joffrey becomes old enough to take full power "

"64" "Dryhtscipe" 2012-05-11 " i can think of reasons not to take the dragons from the mother of dragons first of all nobody knows why the dragons hatched nobody knows why the dragons are even alive in other words but everyone knows that dragons and magic are somehow closely related to one another it is not difficult to see that the mother of dragons is therefore also closely related to magic somehow and magic is something that has mostly gone out of the world and very few people understand in any way anymore  not even the maesters know very much it might not be wise to act too hastily if one actually wants the dragons and i do rather get the feeling that they take the long view in qarth i suppose therefore it makes a certain amount of sense that the only people in qarth who would seriously consider stealing the dragons are the ones who know most about magic "

"66" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-10 " this episode probably has the most deviation from the books but it doesnt really hurt it very much dany learns tough lessons in the books and she needs to start learning them in the show but the dragons being taken didnt sit well with me at all it bothered me at first but then so did the idea from the books that she received hospitality among greedyevil people who lusted after her dragons and who seemingly had the power to take them rather easily and murder her into the bargain if it came down to it yet didnt do so "
"67" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-05-10 " why is joffrey so intimidated by his uncle he was quite threatening towards his mother when she hit him but tyrion calls him an idiot and slaps him around without any repercussions it doesnt quite ring true for me  joffrey is a powermad psychopath and i wouldve thought hed have no problems throwing his uncle in a cell at the very least i dont see joffrey as someone who takes the long view politically if it conflicts with his immediate desires he killed ned stark and is torturing sansa neither of which are politically astute moves so im not persuaded by the idea that tywins appointment of tyrion as the hand is enough to keep tyrion safe however i do remember thinking when joffrey warned cersei never to strike him again that she had a brief window in which to call his bluff she failed the test and their relationship changed irrevocably tyrion would not have let such a challenge go unanswered if his position wasnt secure he wouldnt have slapped in the first place if it was secure hed have responded with a second slap probably an even harder one i reckon that joffrey  being a bully and thus a fine judge of pecking orders  knows not to push his luck it probably helps that tyrion controls the most significant military forces in kings landing in the shape of bron  his goldcloaks and the tribal warriors of the vale "

"72" "Joemanji" 2012-05-10 " i did wonder if they might have been slaughtered offscreen  another of those famous hidden battle scenes but presumably they are still at torrhens square  or headed back more slowly  while ser rodrik rode fast for winterfell with news that torrhens square was safe in the books theon took wintefell with 17 men and that doesnt look too far off what he had on the tv show no way they can wipe out 200 men "
"73" "badger1969" 2012-05-10 " maybe more importantly wtf happened to the 200 men ser r took with him to torrhens square i did wonder if they might have been slaughtered offscreen  another of those famous hidden battle scenes but presumably they are still at torrhens square  or headed back more slowly  while ser rodrik rode fast for winterfell with news that torrhens square was safe again  all speculation   it probably wont matter much in the great scheme of things if luwin is sending for help then the most logical place to send a raven is torrhens square which is relatively close and he knows thats where ser rodrick has gone with his men this is reinforced by ser rodrick subsequently turning up obviously we need to allow some pretty serious dramatic licence in terms of timelines  the raven would take time to get there ser rodrick would take time to return to winterfell but it makes the most sense if we feel the need to plug the plot hole sorry was replying to last part of your message before reading the first part properly significant time having passed between luwin sending the raven  the courtyard scene did cross my mind but then the missing 200 men do become more of an issue than if ser rodrik was riding alone with no idea of the threat to winterfell "
"74" "DiamondDag" 2012-05-10 " its more likely that word gets to robb from one of his bannermen in the north that would be aware of his armies movements how ser rodriks death is discovered is still a bit of a stretch maybe its as simple as someone escapes winterfell to get the word out its been taken theon doesnt have a lot of men there and while the initial capture of winterfell needed to be kept quiet he couldnt hope to keep the entire thing a secret indefinitely "
"75" "5432Hun" 2012-05-10 " how about luwins raven reaches torrhens square and then they send a raven to riverrun who send a rider out to wherever robb is camped again we have to turn a blind eye to timelines "
"76" "badger1969" 2012-05-10 " how was luwin to know at that point that theon meant to tell everyone he had taken winterfell when under attack your natural reaction would be try to get help also theon said he was going to send word to his father and sister so they could reinforce him not to anyone else so if luwin had known that letting stark loyalists know too might let them get to winterfell before yara and her 500 men fair points but still a message reached robb  his men that included news that ser rodrik was dead so if it was luwins raven  not one sent by theon then it was indeed a continuity error as sunnyone says in my world there are no continuity errors in game of thrones so that cant be "
"77" "5432Hun" 2012-05-10 " the other note thing that confused me in this episode was luwin at the beginning he was desperate to get a raven off somewhere  but to whom  for what purpose it wasnt as if theon was planning to keep his arrival at winterfell a secret as he sent off ravens of his own immediately after killing ser rodrik i think youre partly right in your later post that this is just a dramatic scene for luwin it doesnt actuually matter where he was sending the raven but       i dont think he could have been sending a raven to robb because how would he know where to send it robb is moving about fighting battles its never been explained how the ravens know where to take any particular message but if we assume theyre a bit like homing pigeons then they will home between set locations eg winterfell and kings landing if luwin is sending for help then the most logical place to send a raven is torrhens square which is relatively close and he knows thats where ser rodrick has gone with his men this is reinforced by ser rodrick subsequently turning up obviously we need to allow some pretty serious dramatic licence in terms of timelines  the raven would take time to get there ser rodrick would take time to return to winterfell but it makes the most sense if we feel the need to plug the plot hole maybe more importantly wtf happened to the 200 men ser r took with him to torrhens square "

"119" "WalkerboyUK" 2012-05-09 " im struggling with this series but i think thats because im relating it to the book whereas i hadnt read the books before the first series the theft of the dragons doesnt sit well and makes no sense at all also in the book john snow is sent out alone to kill to 3 wildlings up on the ridge not with quorin halfhand and the others having it as a single attack and subsequently realising ygritte is female adds to the story rather than the gang attack in this weeks episode lastly osha sleeping with theon why the whole escape from winterfell has been completely rewritten for the show and not for the betterpresumably it was done to keep up the breast count im thinking weve now seen every female cast member of legal age naked  is that really necessary "

"124" "pikeman" 2012-05-09 " an interesting question given she is privy to tywins war councils and therefore must know how important he is is why didnt she use her first death from jaqen to kill tywin its the obvious move remember though shes only 9 years old  and her wasting the killings is consistent with the book  without giving any spoilers she as no conception of the big picture and is constantly worrying f her mother would want her back because of the bad things she has done without giving any spoilers those of you who havent read th book prepare to have tyrion replaced as your favourite by his big in ey sense of the word brotherthe lannister boys rock  "

"145" "ACertainBang" 2012-05-09 " last thing agree with what sarah says in the blog about theon this season we have been shown lots of crucial turning points for him and it is very easy to see how he almost inevitably has ended up making the mistakes he has we have also been shown through alfies acting in this episode how his heart isnt entirely in it this is what will lead to his downfall i think he is not convincing  convinced enough to cast a big shadow he doesnt really know what kind of prince he wants to be as he says he will treat those loyal to the starks who are now to be loyal to him as well as ned did yet he wants the ironborn to respect him on their far less honourable terms too truly the boy is lost "

"156" "miapatrick" 2012-05-08 " i do see what you mean but to be fair it was an attempted rape scene the television series has avoided actual sex with underage children which is more then the books do for what absolutely happened they could as well have been trying to kill her as rape her as far as what the actress would have experienced and i think the actress playing her younger sisters been through far more violent scenes im not even sure the words her attackers said to her were said at the time or added laterand i dont want to get too right on but i dont think a rape scene would be very easy for a man to act either you have to balance the fact that the character is not underage though the actor is she is literally her first period away from her first sexual encounter unless she manages to hide it and this is very consistent with medieval england with the fact that it is more important to avoid paedophilic thrills then it is to maintain historical accuracy and i think they avoided them "

"160" "5onthe5" 2012-05-08 " i hope so too but i think the scene pretty much made for the tv version was the right choice the threat of rape hangs heavy over the women in the book and the tv writers are obviously committed enough to the source material to want to bring some of that nasty edge to the series i think this is a good example of how got is doing something genuinely new on tv theres never been anything like it in one scene a young teenager is sexually assaulted and its treated brutally and seriously in the next a princess bargains with the spice king over dragons this isnt fantasy that winks at the viewer the creators cast and crew are taking it seriously and its almost like theyre daring the viewers to take it as seriously as they do "

"190" "DiamondDag" 2012-05-08 " it could be down to the fact that tyrion is there as hand on the behest of his father tywin he is in that position through the backing of the most powerful man in the seven kingdoms not to take anything away from tyrions own actions to make himself more secure in the snake pit of course joffrey treats his mother that way because of his general low opinion of women im not sure its a particular defiance of cerseis power he just doesnt see her as someone to fear joffrey might be a complete shit but id imagine he knows full well that his grandad isnt someone you want to provoke which is why his protests at being treated like that by tyrion are never followed up throwing tywins son and hand into a cell would not go down well tywin might hate tyrion but like he said in series 1 hes still a lannister "
"191" "DamnWymz" 2012-05-08 " i assume because he knows that hes speaking for tywin and knows its best not to mess with him "
"192" "CharlieBronze" 2012-05-08 " i read a suggestion on another forum  im spending way too much time on these things  that not only did littlefinger recognize her but that he left the message detailing robs position in order to encourage arya to take off for there its feasible but unlikely though it would be delightfully ambiguous of the producers to refrain from demonstrating that littlefinger was capable of actually helping someone other than himself unless ahem the possible discovery of arya interfered with his long game and he was acting to preserve this by getting her away from tywin  has anyone freezeframed and read the message verbatim "
"193" "SmartyMcFly" 2012-05-08 " because tyrion has the backing of tywin behind him even joffrey realises that whilst tyrion has tywins support he wields real power over kings landing cerseis power is limited to those that she has direct influence over  and the gradual realisation that her powerbase is being eroded by tyrion principally and that her influence is on the wane both over joffrey and more generally in no small part because of the rumours about her and jaime  is part of her being more and more marginalised in kings landing "
"194" "rooksx" 2012-05-08 " why is joffrey so intimidated by his uncle he was quite threatening towards his mother when she hit him but tyrion calls him an idiot and slaps him around without any repercussions it doesnt quite ring true for me  joffrey is a powermad psychopath and i wouldve thought hed have no problems throwing his uncle in a cell at the very least "

"196" "SmartyMcFly" 2012-05-08 " on the other hand baelish clearly tells tywin that he will leave harrenhall that evening and the next time we see tywinarya it is again daylight its possible all this action happened on one day and baelish is still at harrenhall but more likely it is a new day of course what baelish says and what baelish does may well be two different things having recognised her and so openly stated that he will be gone that night  it possibly provides an alibi for an attempt to spirit her away in the next few days or so no spoiler there  these events are different from the book so it is pure speculation it will be interesting to see how this strand plays out because it is so different from the book and knowing what happens in the future really gets me wondering how they are going to weave various lines together "
"197" "Woof73" 2012-05-08 " im enjoying them too the problem is im thinking about the differences when clearly i should be wondering about whether oshas pubic hair is too neat or not im not convinced hes figured it out but i get the feeling he will very soon "
"198" "JDKoopa" 2012-05-08 " i think this series is a little too short as they seem to be condensing an awful lot this time round in series 1 they barely left anything out but whole swathes of plot seem to be gone this series i understand youre never going to get everything in and in some cases its just a load of wandering around in fields but im worried that by writing out certain character and closing certain storylines at this point will lost some impact later the death of the tickler is one his ultimate demise in about book 4 i think was one of the more memorable scenes in the books its probably book 3 now ive said that aryas hatred for him built up over many pages here hes killed pretty much in the same episode he was introduced im not sure how tv finance works but dont they make money per episode surly there was a case to expanding the series to 15 or so episodes this time out hopefully the rumours book 3 will get two series are true however my main worry is that when ygrittes catchphrase kicks in its going to be impossible to take channel 4 news seriously "
"199" "5432Hun" 2012-05-08 " im actually enjoying the differences most of which i think are well judged in pursuit of a more manageable story within the confines of 10 hours of tv they mean i dont know exactly whats going to happen next or how yes tywin might know but weighing it up i dont think he does if he did he would surely have her captive and guarded though treated with the dignity according to her birth and value as a hostage as his cupbearer she can hear all sorts of his plans and theres the risk something untoward could happen to her around the castle "
"200" "Woof73" 2012-05-08 " it occurred to me that baelish might think that tywin knows exactly who is serving his wine and he might at that the sly old dog having just been cut down to size moments earlier he might be holding any further statements of the bleedin obvious in check its certainly a tough one to judge any other noble in the kingdom id hazard a guess that theyd not even register the cupbearer at all littlefinger is a commoner at heart he says its only wine when she spills his drink where cersei would have had her flogged so he knows that servants are people too im just going to stop thinking about the differences between the book and the show particularly in these scenes whos been written out and who hasnt and how theyre going to get to certain events its starting to get in the way of my enjoyment and we cannot have that "
"201" "5432Hun" 2012-05-08 " yes i think thats true aryas personality is one of the most subtlely complex across a game of thrones and a clash of kings as she goes from noble born lady to a killer to runaway to swordwielding fantasist to a mouse and      i wont go any further at this point in the story she is certainly in survival mode and despite everything tywin currently means safety "
"202" "5432Hun" 2012-05-08 " arya  baelish ive been mulling this over and i cant decide if i think baelish recognises her or not it certainly plays like he does theres a bit of a doubletake after she spills the wine then his eyes follow her in a calculating manner then he emphasises the word daughters as she walks from the room on the other hand baelish clearly tells tywin that he will leave harrenhall that evening and the next time we see tywinarya it is again daylight its possible all this action happened on one day and baelish is still at harrenhall but more likely it is a new day so given that ayra is the most valuable lost child in westeros if baelish did recognise her what is his play he could have idenitifed her to tywin thereby ingratiating himself with the most powerful man in westeros he could have tried to take her away kidnapped her and faked a runaway maybe if he is still at harrenhall its possible one of these is still an option but if he isnt did he really just leave such a valuable person working unrecoginsed as a cupbearer amongst a gang of muderous scumbags where even with tywins protection anything could happen to her i cant make up my mind on this one "
"203" "SmartyMcFly" 2012-05-08 " good post  some insightful thoughts another reason for arya not feeding tywins name to jaqen arya has seen the unpredictable and bloody path war can take for those at the bottom of the pile even though young she probably realises that her welfare for the moment rests with tywin so as well as the father role she really is dependent upon him for survival if he were to be bumped off she would be at the mercy of the ticklers cohorts again "
"204" "MarvellousMagic" 2012-05-08 " the fact that i loathe theon greyjoy just as much on screen perhaps more when aa gets that petulent look on his face as i did in the book is in my opinion testimony to alfie allen i think hes playing him brilliantly and yes i was also expecting to hear the odd you know nothing jon snow thrown in from ygritte but otherwise liked her very much very happy that the hound is getting some more airtime too as soon as someone makes or finds a repetitive gif of joffrey being hit in the face by mud andor a tyrionslappingjoffrey montage please post it "
"205" "5432Hun" 2012-05-08 " the bastard of the dreadfort story line is confusing me a bit at present he has not apparently been cast in any guise so cant be physically appearing this season i dont know if this means one particular development will be shunted back to season 3 or that the storyline will proceed as expected this season but with tbofd being introduced later i cant believe they are going to leave him out completely now that he has been verbally introduced in such specific terms im happy enough with the way this story is developing slightly differently from the book just confused as to precisely how it moves forward from here "
"206" "DrQuinzel" 2012-05-08 " the scene of the riot in kings landing was geniunely scary  in a series that has white walkers and direwolves its nice to have the odd reminder that theres nothing scarier than a baying mob or a vicious idiotic king as always i loved that tyrion is the only one to see whats about to happen and gets his youngest nephew sent to safety before it all kicks off his attitude to sansa is interesting on one level hes certainly trying to keep her safe because she is the one leverage they have over robb but on another hes been established as a character who has sympathy for people in unfortunate situations beyond their control  probably seeing something of himself in their predicament in the same way that he showed a fondness for jon the bastard and paralysed bran he also seems to genuinely admire sansa and want to protect her he sent shae to be her handmaiden i just cant say enough about what an interesting character tyrion is i dont get the alfie allen hating hes coming across as weak and awkward because that is what theon is he played the scene in which he sits on brans bed a mix of brother and conqueror really well dany however is meant to be a strong character you root for i think shes the one that were supposed to hope ends up on the iron throne instead i think she needs a slap shes just naive and petulant and her performance is completely devoid of the qualities jorah praised her with last week "

"209" "CharlieBronze" 2012-05-08 " spoiler probably with theon taking responsibility for ser rodriks death im thinking that the bastard of the dreadfort is going to be toned down hell be vicious but his talent for atrocity will be muted and more of his characters actions from the text will be transferred to theon and dagmar it looks like theon is going to be less conflicted by the mess he gets himself in but portrayed as dangerously out of control "
"210" "monkey2" 2012-05-08 " i dont have a great deal of sympathy for theon he is an idiot playing the war game to impress his absolutely awful father as the cost of the starks who raised him like one of their own he has now crossed a line and robb wont ever forgive him the scenes with ariya were brilliant especially the scene when baelish was in the room and clearly noticed her but did not want to say anything as he probably felt that the lanisters were keeping him out of the loop fantastic crossed wires also her personal hitman is bloody brilliant tyrion great as usual he really has surrounded himself with total losers "
"211" "5432Hun" 2012-05-08 " i actually think the scenes with arya and tywin are particularly wonderful because they expand upon what some others were talking about a few weeks ago the lannisters and the starks mirror each other yes  theres a lot id like to talk about here but cant for fear of spoilers if only everyone read the books in plenty of time for the series then we wouldnt have this problem "

"217" "DiamondDag" 2012-05-08 " i agree that with the position shes in arya wouldnt necessarily think of tywin as some to kill her first choice of the tickler was motivated by her desire to see him punished lorch died out of necessity tywin is just a guy who sits at a table actually being quite kind towards her compared to the treatment shes had from others she has a list of people she wants to see dead and they all come from doing something directly to her or others she knows she hasnt yet seen tywin act like a monster "

"219" "PeachMcGee" 2012-05-08 " found it there was something in his face that reminded arya of her own father even though they looked nothing alike he has a lords face thats all she told herself i actually think the scenes with arya and tywin are particularly wonderful because they expand upon what some others were talking about a few weeks ago the lannisters and the starks mirror each other and there is a sense that tyrion and now perhaps tywin see the starks as representing everything they dont have there is definitely a respect and maybe even a jealousy towards the solidarity loyalty and honour of the starks part of the tension of the series and the books is the irony that these are the very traits that seem to be the undoing of the starks whereas the lack of these traits in the lannisters can at various points be their greatest strength for how long however is the central question and one that keeps us watching and reading "

"223" "5432Hun" 2012-05-08 " totally agree and i seem to remember a brief moment in the book where tywin reminds arya of her father and she just tells herself that its because he has a lordly face  have i totally made that up that sounds about right but in all honesty i cant remember exactly how much they interact at harrenhall in the book but i know its nowhere near the level which they do on tv i would ask my wife who has just finished reading cofk but last night i mentioned that theyve obviously cut lots of the initial reek storyline she responded who is reek so i dont hold out much hope shell be any help while im at it i think that the direction they seem to be heading with the whole reek thing should work it would have been hard to get the firstsecond reek story across convincingly on screen but this feels like a good deviation  maintaining the integrity of the storyarc but losing some of the detail which would have confused and cluttered things up "

"227" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-08 " absolutely agree with you about the father figure thing i dont think it even occurs to arya to say tywin because hes almost a god figure hes so far removed from her at this point that i doubt his name even entered her head great post btw "

"230" "5432Hun" 2012-05-08 " some thoughts on arya and tywins surrogate fatherdaughter dynamic this doesnt happen between these two characters in the books so it will be especially interesting to those of us who have rtb to see where it goes occured to me after this episode how deeply this is developing tywin obvioulsy despises his own children jaime is a disappointment cersei a psychoslut tyrion a twisted monster who killed his mother and seems to have shut down his own emotions on his wifes death bed yet he has evidently developed some sort of bond with a northern cupbearer probably because of the qualities of courage and intelligence she shows to the point where he tolerates questions from her which touch on his inner shame at his own fathers weakness which is what motivates him for aryas part she is a war orphan who has lost her father and two surrogates syrio and yoren even though she clearly still despises and fears the lannisters for what they have done to her family i think there is a small ambiguity in her relationship to tywin a strong man like her own father was who has given her a place and relative security an interesting question given she is privy to tywins war councils and therefore must know how important he is is why didnt she use her first death from jaqen to kill tywin its the obvious move yet i think its consistent that a frightened warorphan is more likely to want to see the the tickler dead ie the man she has seen torture a handful rather than the father figure  despite the fact he and his family hves been responsible for the death of thousands its mainly down to the acting that all of this works without it needing to be spelt out through awkward exposition the relationship develops as much in the feel of the interaction between the two characters  eg the paternalistic question and answer sessions  as the actual words they say in danger of becoming a cliche but really cant praise maisie williams enough for going toetotoe with charles dance like this "

"238" "5432Hun" 2012-05-08 " another really good episode series 2 is now running along really nicely im looking forward to being able to rewatch it all and pick up stuff ive missed theon  in the debate about alfies acting im afraid i come down on the side of those who think hes awkward and mannered because hes not very well acted overall i like alfie in the role because he looks so right but i dont believe he has the acting chops to convince on the dramatic stuff fall of winterfell  like others i would have liked to have seen a couple of shots of ironborn scaling walls in the dark and the odd slit throat to establish just how theon took the castle ser rodrik  this series is giving some minor characters some fantastic endings calm down boy im off to see your father smashing stuff  and of course rodriks nephew jory will be waiting too to be fair to alfie allen i thought he did this scene well possibly because he could just let go obviously a pivotal moment for theons character as ser rodrik said he really is lost now dany  yes bit annoying partly because shes just so distant from the rest of the action in series 1 she had the link to westeros through mopatis visarys the plot to kill her and the imminent it seemed dothraki invasion emilia clarke is ok but shes basically had the same scene over and over again so its not surprising she grates a little im glad the dragons have been stolen it gives her something a bit different to do and a more immediate motivation than one day retaking her birthright ygritte  one of my favourite minor characters from the book but then ive always had a thing for redheads so glad to see she made it i thought the actress was good but a bit too clean and tidy matted hair and dirtier teeth in my minds eye really hope they follow this storyline all the way through but then i know nothing littlefinger  he does keep popping up a lot which given theres a massive war on and westeros is supposedly continent sized is straining credibilty a bit in defence its hard for tv to reflect the passage of time there could have been two weeks story time between episodes  think about what theon has done sailed to the stony shore landed fought off whoever was there marched on torrhens square iron born not keen on horses attacked it convincingly enough to draw out ser rodrick marched on winterfell and taken it so littlefinger could have enough story time to make these trips it just feels rushed because we jump straight from one place to another the second defence is that littlefinger is actually tying the whole southern thread of the story together at the moment otherwise wed be relying on lots of ravenmessage based exposition osha  she didnt do that in harry potter in answer to previous points the was a slight incongruity bewteen her sleeping with theon then excaping obviously the supposed point is that having seduced theon he gives her freedom of the castle which she uses to escape but seeing as theon was enjoying his postcoital semicoma none of the guards would have known she now had the freedom of the castle yet she still ezcaped then clearly it wasnt necessary to seduce him at all on the plus side it will make theon feel even more of a throbber when he wakes up "

"243" "TheSub" 2012-05-08 " i was on holiday for the past two weeks and so ive been catching up on whats been going on this probably came up in previous blog discussions but i just have to express my shock at melisandre bearing a slimy kind of shadow thing stannis should watch where he sticks that thing which applies to his penis as well as melisandres shadow things sharp armblade okay im stopping the freudian analysis now to comment on the most recent episode tyrioncan peter dinklage get any better week after week his scenes remain my favourite his comments to the cowdungbeslung boy king were brilliant also his care for sansa is taking a nice turn still cant see whether its purely political or something more tywin and aryafantastic scenes between these two charles dance has succeeded in gaining my sympathy hes obviously tired of being the guy who has to fix everything and keep it all together i do feel sorry for him if ever a father had reason to be disappointed it must be said however that maisie williams as arya outshines everyone around her shes really made the character grow throughout season one and into the current season jon snow and the chamber maidjon is still one of my least favourite characters it was touching to see him spare the earl of granthams former maid turned typist but the stroppy little boy in jon is still all too present for my tastes  especially since i want someone to kill him as soon as he shows signs of his o the universe is so unfair doodah lets hope the snowgrinding new punny verb seems to have been invented on this blog doesnt lead to the ultimate cliche theonwhat a vicious little prat the writers are making it so easy to dislike this pillock jon snow might be one of my least favourite characters but theon is by far the least favourite at least jon snow has a brain im convinced theon suffered a heavy blow to the head as a child clearly i dont really empathise with theon despite him being more of a victim in the greater scheme of things must be because he is such a thick victim littlefingerhes getting better less burgundy rob catelyn brienne and the woman with the sawrob has become likeable less like a teenager and more like a serious leader his scenes with the woman with the saw cant remember her name were good but im holding thumbs that all the love stories dont go cliche from this point onwards briennes loyalty to renly was nice but im not really understanding the character yet the fact thats shes a woman doing a mans job in the context of this fantasy world isnt quite enough to garner any sympathy from me frankly i find her loyalty to renly a bit over the top but thats perhaps because theres not much time to develop it in the show the oath to catelyn was nice though and catelyn has also managed to become more headstrong in her decisions and opinions indicating how she is dealing with her husbands loss cerseisuddenly i see everyone saying shes not that clever at all compared to tyrion i guess she isnt but then again no one is as clever as he is i find this a bit inconsistent though in season one and the first episode of season two we clearly see the clever side of cersei establishing her own power making her stupid now doesnt convince ill see how it pans out sansa and the houndmonster has soft spot for fragile princess and cue mrs potts belting out a disney title song daenerysshes still a favourite character for me and its nice seeing her realising that her brothers tactics wont get her what she wants i like that the plot with jorahs affection for her is finally taking off im thinking that once she gets her dragons back there will be fire and blood not so much because of the inevitable slaying of men and the dragons but because shes always saying it and were still waiting could be any day now and then someim finding it slightly difficult to keep up with the myriad of characters on this show its getting harder to feel involved with any of them since they all get little screen time does anyone else feel this way "
"244" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-08 " interview with the actor says that episode 7 is his favourite    and given what hes had to do so far this season isnt really saying anything    "
"245" "MJ1972" 2012-05-08 " i miss jinne lammisert   take heart i strongly suspect that our favourite smarmy lannister will make an appearance next week and he should be a regular character after that cant wait to see his interactions with a certain stubborn but kindhearted young lady "
"246" "MJ1972" 2012-05-08 " a pretty decent episode in my book although the taking of winterfell was too quick in my opinion and daenerys is indeed getting a bit grating my biggest gripe was littlefinger though  how does he get around so quickly thats not really working for me although his doesheordoesntherecognisearya scene was good loved the cleganesansa scene so glad theyre finally giving that storyline some time there have been hints here and there but theyve been few and far between and very fleeting besides now that storyline is finally going to get some meat i approve i too cheered when roose bolton mentioned his bastard i look forward to seeing him on screen giving joffrey a run for his money in the characteryoumostwanttoseedead stakes i had no complaints about alfie allen in this episode as others have pointed out his hamfistedness was in character in this episode he was playing a boy badly out of his league and he showed us just that i hated the theft of the dragons at first but if the tower we saw at the end of the episode is indeed the house of the undying i think it will work danys trip to the house always struck me as a bit random if thats where her dragons are being kept she has a perfect reason to go there i think the deaths of some of danys khalasar worked well in that they showed us just how vulnerable she is in strange foreign qarth thus making her sense of entitlement all the more outrageous "
"247" "guardiansek" 2012-05-08 " the only thing i know about the books is what my friend who read them has told me and what i gleaned from reading the synopsis of each book on wikipedia best parts  tyrion as always its probably well deserved for having to grow up with the worst big sister of all time tywin and arya for the best acting arya gets the second best lines in the series next to tyrion such as her simple reply that loyalty killed her father its a tribute to the chemistry and writing that this relationship works great despite a pairing that it is incredibly illogical that this unknown girl that tywin knows is a northerner and yet gives her access to his most sensitive conversations and documents plus the ability to poison his whole command team in one winefueled staff meeting i also understand that this whole pairing never happened in the books the actor playing bran stark is doing well too got a couple meaty points when theon barged into his bedroom and his reaction to ser roderick getting executed the part where theon and bran discussed winterfells surrender with theon sitting down on brans bed as if to say youre kind of like a little brother to me so i really need to show you why i am asking you to surrender was good "

"256" "RedHandMan" 2012-05-08 " i know that part of that is down to the character of theon not being a great leader but its still a less than convincing performance for me thats the whole point of the performance the character tries to be authoritative and strong but simply cant pull it off a difficult role and being done very well imo "

"258" "Dryhtscipe" 2012-05-07 " the dragon theft thing is silly and makes no sense whatsoever at least from a readthebooks perspective but i thought the winterfell thing worked perfectly most of the battles have not been shown theres a reason for that also it was much more important to show the violence in the capital and too much violence in one episode wouldve just taken up too much time that could be used on things that actually matter like plot development "
"259" "DiamondDag" 2012-05-07 " oh lets be fair ned had a greatsword made of valyrian steal i think it was doing most of the work "

"262" "anonnyscouse" 2012-05-07 " nonbook reader here dont think it matters though because other reviews have said that the scene im talking about wasnt in the book i think it could be important that we only saw one of danys handmaidens in the carnage after the stealing of the dragons the one who was missing was the one who had the obsession with the dragons in series 1 i think she could be involved in the theft of them "
"263" "glitterfairy11" 2012-05-07 " arya and tywin were brilliant as ever i loved the hound rescuing his little bird about time they paid some attention to that storyline joffrey being slapped was predictably enjoyable what else oh  ygritte perfect i loved her in the books and like her very much on screen so far dany has grown dull one series earlier than i expected based on the books but i hate loath and detest that littlefinger clocked arya hes a sharp eyed little weasel of course he realised it was her im very worried about the implications of that further down the line "
"264" "Elspeth25" 2012-05-07 " hmmm well im going off dany too at the moment especially when she was kneeling over the body of her handmaiden and all she could say was where are my dragons as employers go she could go a bit further with giving a shite about the welfare of her staffplus and i realise this is a bit of a shallow gripe the combination of white blond hair and dark brows is starting to annoy me there ive said it other than that this episode was the first to bring a lump to my throat  the scene of ser rodriks execution and brans powerlessness and horror made awful viewing and full marks too for the direction definitely a case of less shown on screen being more in the imagination it was then also the first episode to make me laugh out loud  jaqen hghar rolling his eyes then amory lorch falling through a door hilarious  looking forward to seeing more of the little bird hound thing too although i was wondering how he found her so quick  hadnt she run down several alleys and found herself in a stable and i have added tywin to my list of got unsuitable crushes boy do i pick em "

"270" "Simgeo" 2012-05-07 " also i think the littlefinger appearing everywhere for no apparent reason is just to keep him in the eye of the viewer as in the books he disappears for an absolute age same goes for tywin although i have to admit charles dance is achieving this with considerably more aplomb than aiden gillen having maisie williams as a sparring partner must help "

"276" "OldModernist" 2012-05-07 " i have been enjoying tywin lannister very much as mentioned in the article a strength of the books is that there are no real heroes and villians most of the characters are complicated and have various reasons for their actions i cant help thinking with theon that the starks shouldnt be so surprised he was a hostage eddard stark killed his brothers so with tywin who in anything else would be as evil a villain as they come we have him treating his servant arya a lot better than other characters treat theirs berating his nobles for their stupidity and seemingly being one of the handful of characters immune to littlefingers charm he is not cruel for the sake of being cruel and does not relish violence "

"279" "Kyle1982" 2012-05-07 " it is the case that the end point of all these changes will still be the ones we know in the books i will say that the pacing of the series this year has kind of spun out of control at points and that will be down to having no central character as in series 1 lots of this years scenes have been exposition i think in episode 3 4 and 5 we returned to people actually talking to each other which was lovely and reminiscent of series 1 for those of you who havent read the books and would like a return to the slower pace then fear not next series will just be 10 episodes of talking if theyre doing a storm of swords book one as they say they are "

"284" "helpop" 2012-05-07 " im not sure if theyre keeping the rest of the barristan storyline in the tv series at all  there has been very little mention of the other elements and characters for that subplot so far "

"287" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-07 " youre right i expressed that badly  but basically i dont have a problem with them not showing the capture of winterfell particularly well i felt brans terror was more important than seeing how exactly they did it that and the scene with ser rodrick which i actually preferred in some ways to the book re the teenage thing ha indeed they would  by i stand by the fact that jon is a virgin who has been trudging around with his band of brothers in the freezing cold denied a womans touch a little bit of grinding would definitely go a long way "

"289" "DiamondDag" 2012-05-07 " to be fair it is kind of the point of where her character is at the moment shes a child with nothing but her name and some dragons which at this point are too young to make her someone to fear more of a target if anything she has taken on the responsibility of the people left behind from drogos death but doesnt know how to lead and doesnt have any skill in dealing with the people in qarth when you get down to it all she has left are empty threats empty promises and desperate pleas it would be silly to have her just waltz into qarth ask kindly for help and have everyone fall over themselves to do her biding shes learning that her name and her demands mean nothing out there only xaro is on her side and thats all for his own gain not out of respect for who she is i do admit that at times what should come across as determination turns into petulance exiled queens and mothers of dragons are not immune to hormones it would seem "

"310" "JonnnyA" 2012-05-07 " somewhere in an alleyway in kings landing lollys stokeworth is not having the best of times "
"311" "candylilacs" 2012-05-07 " liked the episode  lots of liberties with the books but so far im not hating them i kind of like the idea that we might have osha for longer daenarys is supposedly to be about 1415 and feels she is so close to getting her ships but she is frustrated by being so close to wealth and power yet no one is willing to help her dont they know shes daenarys stormborn her name and dragons are all she has so shes going to be screaming it at people i like daenarys because shes one of the few characters that acts like a real person today dont you get it im daenarys stormborn i have dragons love the hound always have "
"312" "candylilacs" 2012-05-07 " i do miss them but thats because i thought bran should always marry meera because she was so cool no money but great with a knife a sense of adventure and loads of common sense "
"313" "candylilacs" 2012-05-07 " one of littlefingers speeches at the tournament first season about how the hound got his scars by the mountain  in the book it was told to sansa by the hound when he was in his cups it kind of showed that he had gotten drunk and his boundaries opened to include sansa of course in the book she was scared of him he realized that and then left "
"314" "Joemanji" 2012-05-07 " also anyone else expecting to hear you know nothing at a certain point "
"315" "candylilacs" 2012-05-07 " tywin is a an understandable person in the books and in the series he has a sense of ethics although all the lannisters seem to turn a blind eye to the mountains evil doings and wants things for his family however i think hes the first person being such a critical father to say his family has failings and failures the only reason he talks to his children is to criticize or berate them even his compliments are backhanded at best such as giving tyrion the hand role "
"316" "Mithriades" 2012-05-07 " where was brans direwolf he should have ripped theons balls apart when he entered the room "
"317" "Kadayi" 2012-05-07 " im not sure they really serve any great purpose any new character has to possess some added value to the narrative vs say more prominent players and i dont see either of them as essential to the story lines progression anyway were getting ahead of ourselves "
"318" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-07 " no bron i dont really find the whole theon taking winterfell very strong  whats the point in taking italso what was the point in osha sleeping with theon liked the stuff in kings landing  the hound killing a few peasants does not make him a badass though  we would need to see him in a proper fight lady talisa makes me feel quite delirious jon snow fucking up again  and why are the dire wolves never around when they are needed i do find their use and place in the series to be a little awkward more tywin and arya  good stuff "
"319" "Joemanji" 2012-05-07 " diamonddag agree on alfie allen  im not convinced either he seems to do theons weaker moments well but when hes trying to be commanding  meh i know that is the character but still he may come into his own later on though with that in mind but donald sumpter was absolutely incredible in his brief winterfell scenes with isaac and natalie also fab hard to keep up perhaps "
"320" "DiamondDag" 2012-05-07 " the trimming has to happen it already feels overstuffed as it is think someone else mentioned those two characters might be kept back until season three like you say the show has developed a great chemistry between osha and bran it would be a good idea to keep them together if thats their intention "
"321" "Kadayi" 2012-05-07 " seems to be the case no doubt book purists will be flipping out over their omission as they tend to do at any digression but i dont see it as particularly egregious decision theres good chemistry between osha  bran albeit the books are wonderful the sheer number of characters most of whom are minor players is mind bending and mind numbing at times especially in the later books elsewhere someone described the tv series as game of thrones with an editor and i dont disagree with that sentiment the shows producers have done a good job so far of retaining the essential elements of the storyline and adapting merging events and characters where appropriate whilst trimming the extraneous fat of the books of which there is plenty anyway good episode overall though death of irri  sadface "
"322" "DiamondDag" 2012-05-07 " have to say im loving the extra time spent with tywin i think charles dance is playing him with enough cold and hardness to know he isnt the kind of man youd look to for a hug plus its charles dance get him on the bloody screen as much as possible also the death of amory lorch produced the biggest belly laugh of both series so far i have no idea why maybe just the idea of jaqen getting to him in the nick of time and letting out an exacerbated sigh the hound badass that whole scene was great though its been said by many that grrms ability to write horror is one of the strongest aspect of the books and i felt the death of the high septon was suitable chilling a man torn apart not by monster but desperate angry people those screams i dont think alfie can pull it off he has his moments but most of those scenes in winterfell were just painful for me hes getting outacted by a boy its mostly when hes trying to act authoritative and purposeful he just cant do it i know that part of that is down to the character of theon not being a great leader but its still a less than convincing performance for me "
"323" "ab47690" 2012-05-07 " im glad im not alone in finding dany a whiney petulant brat this season maybe shell become more benevolent as the season progresses i certainly remember her being a bit more wise and tempered in the books maybe well see a change after her visit to the house of horrors i agree with whoever posted that the dragons have probably been taken there "
"324" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-07 " dont write off barristan selmy    remember ned was glad never to have faced him in battle    and where did he go after being humiliated by joffrey "
"325" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-07 " see last weeks thread although we were careful not to flat out name the characters and their function    "
"326" "OLTizzle" 2012-05-07 " yeah i think youre right about that up until a dance with dragons i was alright with daenerys but then all of a sudden she became a stroppy indecisive numbnuts who you just couldnt help but loathe seems like the dany of season 2 is turning into her futureself a little too soon its not a good thing "
"327" "Frances56" 2012-05-07 " and finally the snow getting grinded on in the snow scene was hilarious shes the one thats tied upbut shes the one doing stuff to him against his will  im so confused "
"328" "wickedripeplum" 2012-05-07 " hee ive heard people comment that the show sort of pushes up the character development on the show to more or less how they end up several books in seems more or less accurate "
"329" "wickedripeplum" 2012-05-07 " i assume that the place her dragons were being taken is the house of the undying just providing new motivation for her trippy vision quest there after seeing sansas throne room scene so toned down before i was a little surprised to see the sansa part of the riot toned up im very much enjoying the non book canon bits of the show especially the arya stuff since in my opinion it was very weak and so very boring in the books making me dislike the parts devoted to a character i enjoy though seriously whats up with killing almost all the non white people when theres no reason "
"330" "Joemanji" 2012-05-07 " yeah i skipped past the dany bits on second viewing "
"331" "OLTizzle" 2012-05-07 " is it just me or is daenerys starting to get a bit irritating her tantrums are becoming a tad bit predictable now pout face raise voice so it quivers fire and blood other than that quality tv "
"332" "MockingbirdGirl" 2012-05-07 " its been a while since i read a clash of kings but am i right in thinking jojen and meera reed have been written out i seem to recall they appear in time to help bran and rickon escape from winterfell though perhaps the writers are thinking osha can fulfill that narrative function on her own "
"333" "objectinspace" 2012-05-07 " another excellent episode though they are departing more from the books than i thought they would this does seem to lead to a few plot holesgaps littlefinger must be making good use of his westeros rail card the tywinayra scenes are possibly the best acting going on tv right now both performances are superb on the hardest man in westeros debate id back the hound over jamie just and loras by miles probably over the halfhand toobut where in this debate does jacqen  haquer come that must have been one of the swiftest assassinations in history "
"334" "SharpMango" 2012-05-07 " great episode the opening was a shocker and it took my a long while to realise this wasnt just a dream and was really happeningi do find it a bit contrived that arya is serving the err top lannister whatever he is called and surely he would have more than one servant and that servant he would have done some sort of background referencing oni mean i know its like a fantasy but surely even in harranhall theyd have an hr department which you know might vet people who can potentially poison someone incredibly important at any time i was also pleasantly surprised that there was almost no full frontal nudity in this episode though when the wildling girl did her thing i did wonder what kind of contracts these actresses sign must be prepared to strip presumably ugh i couldnt imagine doing that in public yet our actors seem so casual about it and finally the snow getting grinded on in the snow scene was hilarious "
"335" "Spacedone" 2012-05-07 " you aint seen nothing yet "
"336" "Fulton" 2012-05-07 " as soon as her being female was revealed i got a sinking feeling about how this was going to go i was yelling fucking kill her hoping to forestall the inevitable yeah i was hoping hed kill her too to break from the usual cliche as i had the same reaction oh its a girl they must inevitably now become starcrossed lovers etc "
"337" "SpacedMonkey" 2012-05-07 " what is seduction if not a grind "
"338" "Fireswan78" 2012-05-07 " its hard to see how dany will recover her dragons unless she does another improbable tour de force like surviving the fire to hatch the dragons unscathed that indicates she is supernatural littlefingers habit of popping up everywhere is annoying if only it were varys who at least has clever repartee and livens up the screen this weeks appearance is only useful if petr recognized arya which i suspect he did so far his character is the biggest departure from the books where he usually had the upper hand in the tv show hes a sniveling weakling pimp so far and more of the hound please wil we get more insight into his feelings for sansa "
"339" "JusticeTeam" 2012-05-07 " im currently rereading the books and developing a little bit of sympathy for tywin put yourself in his shoes his father was weak and ineffectual and almost ruined the richest and most powerful house in westeros leaving tywin to pick up the pieces his children are to him a disappointment cersei is scheming vicious and not that smart jaime is arrogant and unable to be his heir tyrion is physically twisted killed his beloved wife on the way out and only compounds that by being the smartest and most capable of his children something tywin is no doubt aware of even if he hates to admit it chuck in joffrey being a psychopathic monster born of incest and its no wonder that tywin gets a little ruthless when his backs to the wall i think the show is doing a good job in painting him as a man who is mainly trying to hold onto what hes built even if he mainly does that by employing monsters "
"340" "Mmmrrrggglll" 2012-05-07 " all those joffreygettingslapped compilations are gonna need updating  "

"344" "Gen73" 2012-05-07 " i did notice lack of merkin but all i can say lice and crabs maybe the reason i am going to rewatch again tonight and lurk in some of the excellent newbie boards until everyone gets up to speed using the method that cannot be named so thanks to my friend who texed me at 0530 which got me my early start happy may monday to all beware the night is dark and osha may get you ps guys if a potenially dangerous woman offers you free sex in an alley would you think maybe this is too good to be true she maybe after my purse or my life just wondering "
"345" "Gen73" 2012-05-07 " amazing episode having only read book 2 once waiting to after season 2 to read book 3 i was like whats going on then the story sort of righted its self so loving the way it is being organised for tv i was yelling at the tv theon dont for the love of the old gods dont sleep with her not that i care about you but that was massively stupid as least tie her up osha offing that guy was ace but my favourite porridge oatsbook club fella rory mccann the excellent sandor clegane gets my bad ass vote totally love him glad he had more to do tyrion total exasperation at joffery slap him some more "
"346" "WillieMillerisGod" 2012-05-07 " all theon wants to be is loved and respected and all he ends up being is hated and mocked by all all i can say about that is lol "

"348" "CharlieBronze" 2012-05-07 " thats a good point she did look handy with a blade though perhaps with sleeping on castle floors in stables on straw and all manner of bug infested environments it is prudent not too ignore too wild a garden "
"349" "Frances56" 2012-05-07 " i miss jinne lammisert   "
"350" "Andalou" 2012-05-07 " it feels impolite to notice and perhaps i should stick to filth like spartacus rather than the highbrow thrones but osha did appear a little uhm tidy it is nowadays probably tricky to find an actress willing to let things grow but there are effects and costume departments is this likely to become a growing concern  debates on the merits of cgi merkins vs practical merkins "
"351" "jlittlewood" 2012-05-07 " if somebody took my dragons i would be pissed in all "
"352" "CharlieBronze" 2012-05-07 " why does the hound keep calling sansa little bird when shes quite clearly an ostrich this was the archetypal game of thrones episode outrageous but inventive liberties taken with the source material breathtakingly fast paced brilliant character interaction gory sexy tense and moving after theon slew ser rodrik and the implications on story reinvention that had i practically cheered later on when roose bolton said word had been sent to the dreadfort for his bastard son to retake winterfell im probably not a good person so did littlefinger recognize arya i like to think he did is tywin being portrayed too sympathetically hes my favourite character at the moment that cant be right i see the wildings had their own arctic camouflage this week im loving the costume departments work on this series "
"353" "weewilkie" 2012-05-07 " he was off trying to find a ship for daenerys "
"354" "illocon" 2012-05-07 " hodor "
"355" "Brownly" 2012-05-07 " another excellent episode but for one niggle the whole snowygrette thing was so bleeding predictable and cliched as soon as her being female was revealed i got a sinking feeling about how this was going to go i was yelling fucking kill her hoping to forestall the inevitable and when snow was chasing her i kept hoping shed be brought down and savaged by ghost appearing out of nowhere ive got a feeling they are going to be tiresome in the story to come  its annoying because i quite like jon snow the hound was on good form  quite like him too ive thought for a while that he has a liking for sansa or at least sympathises with her and would have her better treated when shes having a bit of joffreybother the camera often touches on the hound for a moment and hes always watching her when it happens he was also straight in there with his cloak to cover her when shed had her clothes ripped at court i think his rescue of her in this episode was his own doing as well  not on anyones order oh and my money would be on him in a bout sponsored by sarah hughes presentations inc with qhorin halfhand from what weve seen so far doggy is the faster stronger more aware "
"356" "suziann" 2012-05-07 " and where was jorah morment when the dragons were taken "
"357" "Joemanji" 2012-05-07 " lack of edit i seem to contradict myself basically i thought theon killing rodrick himself was better than the book events but made less sense in the wider context "
"358" "Joemanji" 2012-05-07 " interesting episode im going to have to rewatch to take it all in but a small note on changes to the book  i dont mind them in themselves but there seems to be some looseness with logic going on for example why did ser rodrick return from torrhens square alone why not bring back the 200 men he took with him and oust the dozen or so theon took winterfell with theon killing rodrick himself is a powerful change and one the nonreader will need to take his treachery seriously also how does littlefinger get around so quickly "
"359" "weewilkie" 2012-05-07 " another fantastic episode the look tyrion gave cercei when she talked about wanting to take way from him something that he loved was brilliantly ice and fire "
