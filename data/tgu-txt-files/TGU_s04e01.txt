"5" "S Snips" 2014-04-13 " this is so true what makes the show fantasy yet believable "
"6" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-13 " in what world was the procurer naked since when showing a shoulder count as nudity unbelievable the procurer wasnt naked yet oberyn wanted him to get naked but he didnt get a chance to strip before they were interrupted i liked the old dario naharis at least he was extravagant this want is completely forgetable i also liked the old dario i know that the internet was abuzz with negativity with the previous actor but i liked him the character was supposed to be extravagant and minus the outrageous clothing and hair as in the books i thought that the casting was good unfortunately for us the original actor was offered jason stathams role in the transporter series of flicks and i cant really blame him for taking the part a relatively unknown actor just doesnt turn down big bucks in a big hollywood action movie the new guy seems okay but hes pretty vanilla compared to the first guy though he is better looking and thats going to come into play at some point dont understand cerseis behavior towards jaime explanations wellcome cerseis reaction to jaime may not exactly mirror her actions in the book and in that sense i dont really get it yet either so i guess well just have to wait to see how their relationship plays out "

"13" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-11 " i liked the old ilyn payne the new one is clearly the shows weakest link "
"14" "longtimelurker93" 2014-04-11 " maybe it has something to do with her sleeping with lancel im not sure either "
"15" "Jez Holland" 2014-04-11 " he was definitely going through the book the from front to back but you may be correct about their use of ser arthur "
"16" "Jez Holland" 2014-04-11 " mandy patinkin is the dream casting especially as he is too old to play the red viper and cement the inigo montoyaness of the character "
"17" "utterflanker" 2014-04-11 " with mrs flanker who cares not for the world of got away for a bit ive finally been able to catch up on the episode and the blog welcome back btw plenty of smart comments here so not much to add really but for what its worth highs the tavern scene obviously especially the dialogue but also aryas emotionless face as she watched the effect of needle also her little selfsatisfied smile at the end  was it because shed exacted some revenge or because shed finally got her pony maybe both jon finally growing a pair the details jaimes little wave the joffrey statue yes the red viper and the candle lows daenerys ive given her storyline the benefit of the doubt for three seasons now but wandering about in the desert is getting a bit old if i wanted that id read the bible the absence of stannis i have to wait another week "

"21" "BeheadtheRoyals" 2014-04-10 " great episode im sort of liking more the series than the books long pov chapters which apparently will never reach a conclusion ending and closure back to the telly and having read the book id love to turn you on i found meself very nervous about the events to come in season three some scenes names and characters were different than the books is the same pattern going to repeat in this current season if so i cannot wait "
"22" "Sinequanone" 2014-04-10 " i dont think glossed over just the casual way tywin has done it shows his ruthlessness "
"23" "davidjones2492" 2014-04-10 " the intercutting was all about the sword ice neds sword was the ceremonial valyrian steel blade of the starks which he used to execute the deserter it was also the weapon that killed him this was what tywin was having melted and reforged at the start in regard to the deserter that blind panic took him all the way down to winterfell which is several hundred miles south of the wall ned had plenty of compassion but if every deserter was shown leniency the nights watch would be emptied overnight with every raper murderer and god knows what else trying their luck going south "
"24" "ciwstudent" 2014-04-10 " there has to be a lot of magic in diecasting swords as shown here normally they are forged which means that a bar of steel is heated up and then folded over its self again and again a bit like puff pastrybut heyho its a series with dragons in it im not going to let my nerdiness spoil it "
"25" "brendanbilbao" 2014-04-10 " well i cant flipping well remember whos who or what happened three seasons ago am i alone "

"28" "shellac" 2014-04-10 " it reminded me of boosting in sport deliberately preparing himself for the sudden violence boosting works by tricking the body into a state of high blood pressure and heart rate with an increased utilization of oxygen improving the athletes performance loved the scene "
"29" "Grotesque" 2014-04-10 " it seems cruel that all his heroic deeds  like actual heroic deeds rather than myths people will tell  have gone unnoticedunseen but joffrey having never done anything brave or heroic in his life is having statues built and will no doubt have pages when all is said and done its an interesting comment on fame history and heroism "
"30" "Grotesque" 2014-04-10 " it has not adverts in america so i assume that if it is running a simulcast it will be shown as is i dont remember there being adverts in the sky go showing "
"31" "ID2250637" 2014-04-10 " that was supposed to be a reply to the post directly above "
"32" "ID2250637" 2014-04-10 " the last daario was a bit ridiculous but as the op said at least he was different from all the faces we see in westeroshes meant to be flamboyant and in your face and until dany said his name i had no idea who the new guy was as he just looks like everyone else on another blog people have complained about the lack of diversity being inherently racistwhich is ridiculous when in westeros which is based on medieval england apart from dorne obviously so youd presume most would be white and english but essos  the free cities is a big mix of cultures and itd be good to get more of a flavour of that although to be fair the eunuchsmissandei as well as the citizens of qarth do reflect this i think weve been deprived of any sid vicious tyroshi fashion thus far to be honesti cant understand why anyone would write a blue forked beard out of the script "
"33" "ID2250637" 2014-04-10 " also slavers bay is quite some distance from westeros cant be bothered looking for it now but someone has done a map of the gotsoiaf world and pieced together all the various regions and you then get an inkling as to how far away meereen is immediately across the narrow sea you have braavospentosmyrlys island i think  volantis which is most southeasterly then where valyria used to be  the smoking sea and then on the other side of that slavers bay so even if he did believe the tales of dragons they are a very dangerous boat or land journey away that could take over a year the most recent dragons were stunted and tiny and shes miles away and young whilst westeros is fresh from war with lots of power plays going on behind the scenes "
"34" "RacingCert" 2014-04-10 " i go back and forth on shaeunlike tyrion who no longer wants to "
"35" "VonSparron" 2014-04-10 " thats the only time i can remember seeing her smile "
"36" "tronald" 2014-04-10 " oh i got that it was sarcasm i was just pointing out the correct bit what a dull life you must live to find entertainment in being patronising and sarcastic on a blog about a programme you dont like have a recommend to give you the validation you clearly crave "
"37" "VonSparron" 2014-04-10 " sarah i totally agreed with you until i rewatched episodes 910 from season 3 and found daario a lot less annoying than i remembered first impressions of the new guy were good though so lets see how it pans out over the coming season "
"38" "Sunburst" 2014-04-10 " you were right with this bit it was sarcasm dear one day when you grow out of bookstv shows with dragons zombies and witches youll learn about that too "
"39" "Sunburst" 2014-04-10 " youre monotonously fucking boring and pretentious im modelling myself after george rr martin "
"40" "Wigwampaddy" 2014-04-10 " oh the thoeries i have on this pointdanaerys and her vision in the house of the undying included "
"41" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-10 " well theres nothing like disagreeing forcefully i suppose generally i dont tend to simply say someones talking rubbish when i disagree but each to their own obviously its a personal thing but i couldnt take skrein at all seriously he just looked too like an eighties cheesecake model good point about diversity though although i actually the character of daario is one of the weakest things in the books martin generally writes complex rogues well but for some reason i never find him interesting or believable so perhaps thats why ive struggled with the character on screen "
"42" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-10 " which says it all really enlighten me what does it say i saw peasants "
"43" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-10 " this is background information that is given in the novellas which occur before the events in game of thrones another thing to consider is that during this time period dragons were considered to be extinct for over a century when the last dragon died during the reign of aegon iii grrm has said there are no more dragons known to exist but this is a medieval period and large parts of the world are still terra incognita so there are always tales of dragon sightings in far off mysterious places the maesters tend to discount those so for tywin these reports of dragons are most likely nothing more than rumors about an exiled teenager she is also far off in the free cities which is across the narrow sea east of westeros although you would think a sensible ruler would pursue any potential threats no matter how absurd or distant its also important to note that the in the first season of game of thrones robert was pursuing the targaryens not because of their danger but because of what rhaegar targaryen did to lyanna stark his love at the time he was motivated by vengeance more than anything else they briefly touch upon this early in the first season "
"44" "Kit Kimberly" 2014-04-10 " after the unfortunate decision to lumber ed skrein with a haircut that was more fabio than seasoned mercenary commander we have been granted a new daario naharis in the shape of tremes michiel huisman who already appears a much better bet not least because he looks as though he might know what to do with a sword rubbish skrein and his hair and abs and crooked smile are the closest thing the show has gotten to the diversity across the narrow sea that is not close at all daario is supposed to have blue hair styled wildly and and a long blue beard in 3 braids benioffs and weiss lack of courage or laziness or whatever it is that prevents them from recreating martins wonderfully diverse cultures is the shows weakest link and huisman please he was the one element of treme that was immanently disposable and his lack of charisma is already apparent in got imo hes now the shows other weakest link bring back the longhaired warrior hunks hetwomen need eye candy too "
"45" "Pygar" 2014-04-09 " i thought nihilists were nothing to be afraid of  "
"46" "Anopheles" 2014-04-09 " im certain that was kathy burke cameoing as a corpse facing the camera when hound and little miss stabby pass through the massacre before the inn "
"47" "DiamondDag" 2014-04-09 " fair point i wouldnt expect them to be all cuddly and nice and i do understand why theyve depicted them like this its a quick and easy way to set them apart from the other wildlings "
"48" "Moreisless" 2014-04-09 " even worse he cannot keep his children onside he will end up like henry ii "
"49" "DiddleyDum" 2014-04-09 " his cancer is terminal the initial prognosis was that he would not survive 2013 thankfully he is still with us but this time last year that looked unlikely "
"50" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-09 " wasnt he leafing through the book backwards ill have to rewatch again perhaps ser arthur should be quite recent considering he only died duringjust after roberts rebellion maybe they arent using him as anything more than as a historical famed knight rather than rhaegars closest friend "
"51" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-09 " yeah it was hard not to feel your heart go out to jamie a bit in that scene which is disturbing considering who they are "
"52" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-09 " ive a soft spot for doran he comes across as one of the few noblemen to actually care about all his people rather than just himself or the nobility but i suppose any further discussion of him veers into spoilery territory all i shall say is alfred molina as a dream casting "
"53" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " that seems to be true but the dragon thing does seem kind of an big thing to ignore like someone parking huge missiles right off your coastline its hard for me to see if he could ignore problems to that degree how he could have succeeded as hand as long as he did on the other hand he is cersies father and she is pretty good at making herself believe what she wants to be true tyrion isnt bad at it either so maybe they got it from him "
"54" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " im confused about the part where arya asked the hound why he had not money and didnt steal any from joffery just last season she saw her friends beric and thoros steal all of his cash and give him an iou "
"55" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " the martells i could have done without especially telegraphing their hostility towards the lannisters so quickly this right under the nose of tywin who just brought down robb stark in the end without a battle one of the things that doesnt come out much or at all on the show is that oberyns brother doran aside from having poor health is an extremely subtle politician who plays the long hand and doesnt make bets he wont win he was supposed to be the one to come to kings landing but he sent oberyn instead knowing his nature and how he was likely to behave "
"56" "Clariana" 2014-04-09 " as i said above tywin is all realpolitik what he cant see doesnt trouble him "
"57" "Clariana" 2014-04-09 " tywin is a realistempiricist he doesnt believe in anything he cant see although there are dragon skulls for tywin theyre like the dinosaurs long time gone "
"58" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " remember what olenna said  she and mace arent necessarily on the same page "
"59" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " my impression in the books though was that they were civilized in the sense that they had a hierarchical social structure and better equipment not necessarily that they werent brutal and strange although i agree that the cannibalism seems out of place especially in light of later events but maybe they know stuff we dont "
"60" "Clariana" 2014-04-09 " jaime is actually in a horrible position i think tywin knows this and thats why hes left the door slightly ajar i think at the moment jaime is just trying to do his duty while he assesses the situation pressure is coming at him from all directions but he only really lets brienne know that "
"61" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " the hound is always eating pigs feet apples whatever that thing on the stick was "
"62" "Clariana" 2014-04-09 " the one that survives the longest obviously "
"63" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " it appears to me that jamie had a road to damascus style epiphany on the road to harrenhall much like his old man hes concerned for the first time in his life with his legacy its what lives on after youve gone its occurred to me that its significant that he confesses everything that happened after losing his hand while sitting in a bathtub its after that incident that he begins to really heal and grow stronger psychologically and begins trying to be true to some sort of good it seems like a conversion story to me theon strikes me similarly and some others follow the same general pattern as the story goes on "
"64" "Clariana" 2014-04-09 " great analysis exactly let the ner do well second sons duke it out see who comes out on top nothing ventured nothing gained surprisingly but that would be telling "
"65" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " its a problem for her and i think its meant to be but what do we expect from a kid that would be reading teen beat if she lived in our world "
"66" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " i would have maybe said he was a cynic and an alcoholic "
"67" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " i actually had the opposite impression they spent almost the whole time telling us that obyren was kind of decadent and that the dornish think differently about sex martin communicated that with a few lines in a few scenes here and there  not all at once but pretty efficiently and in a way that was integrated into the storytelling we lost a lot of the indications that oberyn was actually politically insightful as well as just dangerous in a more direct way we lost almost all of the backstory of the lannisters and martells all of the stuff about the tywin and the targayrians and all of the stuff about the functioning of the lannister household when jamie cercie and tyrion were youngsters not that i would have expected all that to get into the show but i dont think there is any way the scene in the show came close to summarizing what was in the conversation oberyn and tyrion had while they were riding into kings landing  it was one of the really great scenes in the book funny and clever as well as giving a ton of information the show scene was mostly about looking at boobs it was i think the only one in the episode i was disappointed in "
"68" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " brings me to my oft griped about shae i still cant figure out if its the character or the actress that i dislike or both shes petulant loud ungraciousugh my guess is that you are supposed to have mixed feelings about her book shae was acually much less likable  she was a shallow stupid little twat they have made her more likable in the show she really seems to love tyrion and that is the source of her anger im not sure if that is just to attract viewer or because they felt that people would think the written character was antiwoman but i dont think she could be a completely good character and really move the plot along the way she did in the book "
"69" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " i didnt notice less scars but they seemed a bit differently shaped especially around his mouth but it might have been the hair "
"70" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " plus – did tywin or anyone in kings landing get the raven from the wall about what’s about to come never mind the wildlings – this white walker malarkey has got me worried the thenns byjingoes they are looking for some fat southerners aren’t they mind you if you didn’t eat your enemies beyond the wall there is a good chance they’ll come back as a white walk then you would really be in a spot of bother… he doesnt believe in white walkers or even that there are enough wildings to be a threat in act i would say that while brilliant in one sense his inability to imagine anything is different from how he sees it is his big blindspot he doesnt really think his family will oppose him that the supernatural could be real or that people who slaughter their guests might e cursed by the gods those possibilities just dont exist for him i honestly perhaps naively thought that when jamie said he was not going to have a wife or children he might hot foot it to the wall don the black and become a crow yes i know naive huh he meant he would remain in the kingsguard they serve for life and are not allowed to marry or hold land by becoming kingsguard he deprived tywin of his heir "
"71" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-09 " he discussed it with joffery last season but didnt seem to think it was important which seems odd i cant decide if he was lying about what he thought or it is just too airyfairy for him to take seriously  he pretty much dismisses the possibility of anything magical "
"72" "R042" 2014-04-09 " got is categorically not trying to be clever its unpredictable entertainment nonsense its a highly topical and relevant commentary on the war on terror not to mention an incisive look into gender politics and on top of that a look into the australian labour party "
"73" "R042" 2014-04-09 " its coming back on amazon tv causing conniptions in people who really hate amazon for being the scum of the capitalist earth some nonsense to do with taxes "
"74" "Jez Holland" 2014-04-09 " remember there are only three people in the kingdom who could best jamie but i would go team selmy all the way "
"75" "VonSparron" 2014-04-09 " i did wonder about the hood thats a terrible shame if its the case as i thought he was perfectly cast "
"76" "VonSparron" 2014-04-09 " oh yeah go on then ill have half half a tic tac "
"77" "VonSparron" 2014-04-09 " i agree with your first point take the scene with oberyn  two full frontal female nudes and a slight glimpse of the procurers hairless chest hardly even handed regarding your second point  all the whorehouses we see are the ones visited by noble lords so i imagine the workers are well rewarded and looked after im sure you can find the less salubrious kind down fleabottom "
"78" "SharpMango" 2014-04-09 " yes  the costume designers were fantastic this episodewhat brienne was wearing completely captured how uncomfortable she was feelingwhat the highgarden girls wore being all summerydaenery rocking a dress and trousers look hey im a guy i dont know the technical termsand of course the dornish prince with the deep vee "
"79" "R042" 2014-04-09 " a little worried about arya loving the killing so much though its just a sign of how progressive and feminist the show is  a young girl killing grown men is very progressive and shows how game of thrones is the most feminist fantasy story "
"80" "SharpMango" 2014-04-09 " you mean your tired of her marching around completely disconnected from the rest of the characters liberating slave cities we hadnt heard of beforei cant wait to see if she frees mereen sooooooo interesting it looks exactly like yunkai complete with grr martins interest in having a goddess as its symbol with her legs wide open "
"81" "R042" 2014-04-09 " just as in the real word the us has committed all sorts of terrible acts but our propaganda tells us the russians are the bad guys  and how that living in fascist uk plc is literally worse than north korea "
"82" "VonSparron" 2014-04-09 " tywin disowning jaime appears to have been a little bit glossed over that seems like a fairly important plot point "
"83" "R042" 2014-04-09 " he’s tryin’ what with the folksy charms and protohomoeopathy “this one makes tea this one is poison” i wasnt aware that my cup of tea this morning was homeopathic "
"84" "Sinequanone" 2014-04-09 " yes i guess at the time robert did not have so much to worry about still people should be aware  that dragons are coming "
"85" "rickyredmanc" 2014-04-09 " great sense of humour you have there "
"86" "pdboxer" 2014-04-09 " no need to apologise i found it useful if you were to give spoilers for future events ie tell me jodfrey gets his head chopped off in the next episode i read it in the books or something i might have grounds for complaint well maybe not if jodfrey got his head chopped off that would be grounds for rejoicing however it happens but filling in details around events that have already happened based on what you read in the books is useful so thanks "
"87" "Moreisless" 2014-04-09 " tywin has stated several times that the most important thing is family his 3 children and grandchild are not obeying him his goose is cooked "
"88" "VonSparron" 2014-04-09 " robert was paranoid and hated the targaryans more pragmatic ned stark essentially told him not to worry about it im sure tywin is aware of it but has more pressing things to attend to like his grandson being a right royal pain in the proverbial "
"89" "Sinequanone" 2014-04-09 " no spoiler please but here is a picky point in the first season robert was very aware of the danger of the targaryens and their activity over the sea surely tywin is aware of dani and her dragons and slave army has he mentioned it "

"93" "MashaHeddle" 2014-04-09 " i read the initial reports that he had decided not to undergo treatment and therefore was going to withdraw from production sounds like perhaps there was more to it going by your comment if he is now getting treatment then all the best to him its hard to imagine anyone else taking his place "
"94" "pdboxer" 2014-04-09 " ah i was about to say i think i would have remembered that line but i guess you got it from the books which i have not read "
"95" "Sinequanone" 2014-04-09 " i think one of the great things about got is its politics are complex and no one is without guilt and the winners write the history just as in the real word the us has committed all sorts of terrible acts but our propaganda tells us the russians are the bad guys  "
"96" "Sinequanone" 2014-04-09 " im not a book reader and i agree that the other daario did look more exotic the new one does look samey agree its the one jarring negative of the opener "
"97" "bleudegex" 2014-04-09 " joffrey actually suggested to tywin that they should do something about dany last series and tywin curtly dismissed him probably the only mistake he has made so far "

"110" "NZerDan" 2014-04-09 " tywin is the man if something needs to be done about the dragons he will put pen to paper and have dany killed by someone like a faceless man of braavos in his own good time of course he has no idea about arya bran  rickon being alive keeping the starks in the game but has sansa in his pocket foiling the tyrell plot easily funnily enough his kids give him the biggest headache just like most folk the thenns can i say i liked the book version of them without being spoilery they showed their hand with what the viewers will get from the thenns but i agree they look scary mofos but the cannibals could have been another tribe surely "

"113" "ocelot75" 2014-04-09 " great episode welcome back sarah from the house of hughes and all the regulars from last season’s blog so good to see you all was it wrong that i was quietly cheering for young ayra to get involved with the hound in the fight that glint in little ayra’s eye you literally could see her ticking it over in her mind when the right time was to get involved oh sweet revenge i did cheer at that moment when she skewered polliver plus she got her pony… interesting that tywin thinks that by melting down neds sword flinging the dire wolf pelt on the flames that the house of stark is no more but could it be said the best chance dare i even think it of justice for the house of starks comes from ayra and her reclaimed sword needle have no idea how this will come about perhaps that coin is burning a hole in her pocket the two swords from the house of stark size isn’t everything then again – after the red wedding i have learnt that got can give cruel twist of fate to favourite characters and justice sometimes never comes one thing that has struck me is that tywin thinks he is all over everything that nothing will get inbetween him and his family’s power in westeros but i think he’s a bit blinded at dany and her dragons was there mention of dany last season by someone in kings landing that she now has dragons can’t remember who it was but they mentioned that if she did have dragons they would be tiny and deformed like the last dragons who lived in kings landing at least robert baratheon kept taps on the khaleesi plus – did tywin or anyone in kings landing get the raven from the wall about what’s about to come never mind the wildlings – this white walker malarkey has got me worried the thenns byjingoes they are looking for some fat southerners aren’t they mind you if you didn’t eat your enemies beyond the wall there is a good chance they’ll come back as a white walk then you would really be in a spot of bother…i honestly perhaps naively thought that when jamie said he was not going to have a wife or children he might hot foot it to the wall don the black and become a crow yes i know naive huh too many questions and it’s only the first episode all i know is winter is coming "

"116" "digit" 2014-04-09 " ill buy that "
"117" "digit" 2014-04-09 " no its just that i cant see that hes doing what you say hes in a difficult situation but he could easily still at some point find a way to beat both joffrey and his father not engaging with the situation at all was never going to be the way to do that im prepared to concede that regardless of how bad stannis eventually turns out to be – and he could be very bad indeed if his penchant for human sacrifice matures – theres no way tyrion could have known how bad he already was when the battle occurred but didnt he try to get the inexperienced and slight joffrey to ride into battle at the head of the army "

"123" "zephirine" 2014-04-09 " people allow the fact that hes a sympathetic character to cloud their assessment of what hes actually doing my impression is that both you and digit are right about tyrion because hes changing he has been as you describe complicit with his ghastly family all his life because he didnt know any other way to be and he still is complicit in the sense that he participates in the lannister government and for a long time in the past he just stayed drunk and got laid and presumably hid a terrible deep hopelessness but what were being shown increasingly is a man whos gradually realising that he isnt quite as trapped as he thought he was and is also becoming more aware of his own capabilities thats why the character is so fascinating because at this stage we dont know how far he can go towards the good side or how far he wants to go "

"127" "pdboxer" 2014-04-09 " i love the character hound his scene this week was one of the few times i agreed with the statement i was given years ago by those friends trying to persuade me to watch game of thrones its like sopranos with swords they also said sons of anarchy was sopranos with motorbikes the actor who plays hound is awesome one of the most realistic scenes was him and jerome flynn trash talking each other in the bar last year that actor has genuinly seen hard nuts and how they behave in scotland quite obviously and can brilliantly put himself in their shoes their mindset in a similar way that de niro or pesci can draw on their experience of wiseguys i didnt like the bit where they melted down the sword "

"152" "elleesse" 2014-04-08 " yes but tyrionwhos been whoring his way around westeros since we met him in season 1 it would be more befitting of his character to relieve stress in the same old way i would have thought this just seems very out of character  not that hes being nice and kind and empathetic towards his new wife but that hes not being like that and twisting the situation to benefit him as well however i take your point and point of refan99 i suppose having tywin lannister lurking about would be enough to shrivel up anyones sword butalsobut he seemed to actually love shae and he just let her waltz out of his life hating him rather than getting her out of his life and still holding him in some kind of esteem anyway no doubt all will become clear in further episodes which i await with anticipation   "

"174" "digit" 2014-04-08 " i had a feeling you were partly going on extra info from the books which i dont have but sorry even with this you havent convinced me he said he enjoyed playing the game yes but what did playing the game involve for him it was entirely about mitigating the harm his family were doing what do you need him to do in order to see this have him bang on about his virtuous intent like some puffedup pious bore in failing to see this you treat him the way the ordinary people of kings landing did lumping him in with the lannisters as a hate figure when he was the only one trying to ensure they didnt starve his enjoyment of the game and his own adeptness at it is all about the chance to use his considerable but previously underemployed intelligence in the service of good after a lifetime of being a useless dissolute addon despised and illtreated by his family and having to watch that family commit all kinds of appalling obscenity your objection that he only cares about harm to others when its nearby and real to him feels like a version of that common cif accusation whataboutery hes doing what he can theres no way he could have stopped the war between the starks and the lannisters and to the extent that he was jocular about sansa being raped it was only with the acerbic humour of someone whos disgusted by this kind of abuse his participation is ultimately voluntary out of a mix of enjoyment of having power fear of losing his cushy lifestyle and an unwillingness to go against his father according to his own logic he could have had an even cushier lifestyle with shae on an island i dont think hes afraid of losing that at all tyrion could have joined stannis he didnt have to oppose him ive already addressed this stannis himself is just as bad as joffrey and if his army had overrun kings landing a lot of innocent people would have been massacred also though this was tyrions chance to prove once and for all to his family and his father above all that he was not the useless embarrassment theyd always made him out to be and he did they just didnt have the decency to acknowledge it "
"175" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-08 " but theyre not very interesting they really arent that interesting danys storyline in general does get a bit tedious in the books im hoping this is one aspect the show will change and improve on "
"176" "CaptainCanada" 2014-04-08 " and to point out he explained his reasons for staying to shae in episode 210 he likes playing the game and hes good at since then things havent been going nearly so well for him of course his participation is ultimately voluntary out of a mix of enjoyment of having power fear of losing his cushy lifestyle and an unwillingness to go against his father tyrions conscience is only really challenged when he is asked to harm innocents personally right in front of him as with sansa who he was asked to rape himself when tywin first raised the idea of the lannisters raping her he was jocular he became outraged when he was asked to do it the rapes and murders the lannister armies hes supporting are committing by comparison are abstract to him this is not to argue that tyrion is a truly terrible person or anything if he alone was calling the shots most of this wouldnt have happened though he was planning to unleash hordes of mountain clansmen on the vale to rape pillage and plunder in response to his being put on trial there but just following orders isnt a moral defence "

"186" "DrGiggles" 2014-04-08 " that last scene demonstrated that the show will overtake the books panic brigade are wrong it was almost 10 minutes for a relatively minor incident yet it was the most gripping of the hour i wish they would do this more often build up the tension let the writing and acting and violence take over the characters are good enough to get away with this tactic no need for these short dropins the vying for danys attentions bit was the episodes low point screw these guys personally i cant wait for the return of the bastard of bolton ramsay snow and his rotten papa "

"193" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-08 " i personally think that the bookshows strongest characters are largely the female ones sansa caitlyn arya and cersei all have phenomonal characterization sansa in particular is one of my favorites she begins as this naive girl only concerned with knights and songs and lemon cakes then to this grief stricken teenager and she quickly learns what to say and how to act in kingslanding to survive without diving into spoiler territory her character development doesnt stop there in my opinion sophie turner knocks it out of the park "
"194" "longtimelurker93" 2014-04-08 " that shake of the head from tyrion was priceless "
"195" "Sinequanone" 2014-04-08 " not disappointed can they keep this up year after year fingers crossed loving the arrival of the spanish in the series to get a whole new fab character or two seems like a a lovely gift  almost unbelievable they can throw new quality at us like this the hound  gets by some distance the best fight scenes the best so far i thought was against beric dondarrion  that blew my mindthis was also fab at one point they nearly had him  and there was arya watching  she might also have been quite happy to see him killed  and then stepped in at her moment of choosing  shes so fricking sharp and clever  omg what could she become when fully grown no spoilers please sill love daenerys and her little troop of followers and the bit where the dragon bit back at her was one of the best moments of this fab opening epidode really did not expect that  presumed they were hers completely awp sansa and tyrions conversation gave me a little tear  i think she has always done a great job with one of the hardest parts to play in the series good to have you back too sarah "
"196" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-08 " although if the intent was to give it to margaery why not just do so directly instead of giving it to sansa sansa said she would wear the necklace with pride after finding out what it means to ser dontos so i do think she may be hesitant to give it up "
"197" "Jez Holland" 2014-04-08 " i agree re dany  the only thing she has going for her is her dragons that and the 8000 super eunuchs who feel no pain "
"198" "longtimelurker93" 2014-04-08 " also the necklace is blue margaery always wears blue dresses i think im clutching at straws here "
"199" "weirdofella" 2014-04-08 " i missed the intro scene my sky recording began midway through the opening credits thankfully reading this blog ive just watched it on youtube one thing ive learnt is never to delete an episode after watching it as after reading these blogs i always feel the need to have a second viewing in the case of true detective thats a second viewing with the subtitles turned on ive read all the got books but i guess i just cant take it all in "
"200" "Flossiethefloozie" 2014-04-08 " i cancelled the live stream part of my lovefilm when i saw the charges amazon were imposing though i think they had a more expensive offer that got you everything but it wasnt good value for money for a couple of shows when compared to now tv and netflix "
"201" "ishouldbewriting" 2014-04-08 " also had that badboy dangerousness about him the kind thats kryptonite to 1617yearold girls all over the world and to be fair a number of women whore supposedly old enough to know betteri just wish someone had told me id have been much more of a git when i was a younger man or probably not "
"202" "MRONeill" 2014-04-08 " yep if you recall early in the series robert and ned in winterfells crypts visiting lyannas grave i dont think its spoiling anything to say that her abduction by rhaegar was at least partially the impetus to roberts rebellion against the targaryens "
"203" "MRONeill" 2014-04-08 " very true  we havent seen jaime and joffery in the same room together for quite some time but even knowing how evil joff is i was surprised to see how utterly horrid he was to jaime i think at this point in time jaimes insistence on remaining in the kings guard is more of an honor thing and defiance of tywin than anything else also cersei hadnt so rudely rebuked him when he told tywin he was not going to return to casterly rock "
"204" "ishouldbewriting" 2014-04-08 " she is absolutely fantastic though mention should be given to sophie turner toolets hope she doesnt disappear up her own backside though itd be so easy to do at that age "
"205" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-08 " i have a hunch i do doubt its a coincidence that 1 ser dontos approaches sansa after being gone for so many episodes 2 he gives her a necklace and there is a scene where margery needs a better one to wear on her wedding day "
"206" "ishouldbewriting" 2014-04-08 " as i understand it a psychopath is someone who enjoys making others suffer andor derives pleasure from the act of killing and is driven to act they have a modicum of empathy since they understand fear in others at least and enjoy being the cause of it animal or human it makes no odds in the series theon is in the hands of a psychopatha sociopath on the other hand derives no true pleasure from others suffering or from the killing they lack empathy for other humans but most likely wouldnt harm or kill an animal without cause survival be it selfdefence or for food being the notable exception if or when they kill it is an objective exercise and one that is consciously chosen even if there is drive there the time to act is carefully selected and prepared for in the series aryas pretty well on the way to becoming a sociopath "
"207" "QuestionMark83" 2014-04-08 " i think lions tooth was the sword arya flung in the river and joffrey got a new one hearteater "
"208" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-08 " the intro scene was great but i was a little underwhelmed by the lack of magic being shown for the reforging of a valyrian steel weapon it seemed pretty standard and ordinary especially since it is said that only 3 people know how to accomplish such a task "
"209" "BishopLenBrennan" 2014-04-08 " no he gave jaime the bigger one the smaller sword is kept for someone else "
"210" "jimmy_mac" 2014-04-08 " and clearly joffrey is aware of the incest rumors swirling around cersei and jaime i wonder if joffrey sometimes worries whether uncle jaime might be a closer blood relative for joffrey the most worrisome aspect of contemplating his actual lineage is probably not the potential scourge of being a child of incest instead joffrey knows he has no legitimate claim to the throne if it should be revealed that he is not the son of robert baratheon but merely the bastard son of jaime lannister i mean thats why ned stark had to go right westeros cant have lords running around saying joffrey is simply an evil bastard son of incestuous sibling lannister parents "
"211" "Jon Snow" 2014-04-08 " indeed particularly as he seems like such a good lad in real life httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2puefijbjqq "
"212" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-08 " surprisingly cersei sansa and catelyn all came across alot more sympathic in the tv series than the books because of the sheer volume of the books swallows their roles dany on the other hand gets alot of book time but yes seems a bit tame at the moment and all conquering as for the hound remember he offered to take sansa away from kings landing albeit in a very hound manner "
"213" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-08 " i dont mind the nudity much especially when it makes sense in the context of the narrative oberyn is one of those times where to me it made sense it does seem that as the series progresses there has been less overall nudity ill be interested to see where they take arya and the hounds storyline since the inn was near the end of asos and a certain event didnt take place though more scenes with the hound and arya are never a bad thing also the only time i ever rooted for dany was in book 1 and towards the end of dance "
"214" "Valeria Collins" 2014-04-08 " ive already got a lovefilm subscription so the next step to amazon video is worthwhile for me but ill wait until ripper street reappears "
"215" "BishopLenBrennan" 2014-04-08 " lions tooth was the sword that arya lobbed into the river in s1 which cost us the bakers boy and sansas direwolf also earned the hound aryas enmity lost it was then replaced by hearteater that sansa had to kiss "
"216" "dsk84" 2014-04-08 " a work colleague told me to check out the reaction of the crowd when the undertaker got beat biggest state of collective shock ive seen since the videos of the red wedding reactions "
"217" "HashRouge" 2014-04-08 " its not that i find it offensive god knows i watched every single series of spartacus so a bit of nudity doesnt bother me more that it just seems so pointless its almost as though the directors have sat down and thought you know what this episode needs more boobs "
"218" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-08 " shit yeah how the hell did i forget that i love spaced  anger pain fear agression is one of my favourite responses to how im feeling of all the things everyones written today that might be the thing that makes me kick myself the most curse you also he was in black books so i failed twice over there "
"219" "RedFan99" 2014-04-08 " i must say i find his lack of lust for her since marrying sansa strange i think it has more to do with his father now being around and being the hand the family dynamics are pretty clear the real lion of lannister is reigning as hand and all his children and grandchild king or not best be on guard he has already killed tyrions first love tywin will do whatever it takes to get his way and tyrion knows this better then anyone and there is more coming about this but no spoilers  "
"220" "Flossiethefloozie" 2014-04-08 " i agree re dany  the only thing she has going for her is her dragons and the less time we spend with her the happier i am same goes for melisandre and the greyjoys im not bothered at all by the nudity  it neither adds nor detracts from my enjoyment of the show as there are far more interesting things going on in the plot to worry about whether i find it offensive or not "
"221" "Rob Unkut" 2014-04-08 " good to see that tywin made sure that his sword was slightly longer than the one he gave jamie cant have your onehanded son swinging around town with a bigger blade than his old man can we "

"224" "longtimelurker93" 2014-04-08 " i did this for every episode whilst catching up with the series "
"225" "digit" 2014-04-08 " i totally disagree the only way tyrion can really be said to have helped joffrey stay on the throne is by beating stannis but that wasnt about individuals if stannis had won tyrion himself and numerous others at kings landing would have been for the chop and its not as if stannis would have been any better than joffrey anyway it would have been like replacing caligula with the grand inquisitor other than that hes quite terrified of his father as everyone can see from the way he desperately tries to hide shae the one option he seems to have had is to go off with her for a sybaritic island life but here i think the writers have suffered a slight lapse of logic instead of saying to shae but what would i do surely the real retort is youd never be safe theyd come after us and kill you because my father would never allow me to sully the lannister name by marrying a lowborn whore im hoping hell use his political cleverness to beat his dad and his sister "

"228" "HashRouge" 2014-04-08 " ive never posted on the blog before so here goesi absolutely loved it really liked oberyn martell that was a great piece of casting i loved all the little interactions between key characters jaime tywin jaime cersei margaery olenna tormund ygritte etc one of the strokes of genius of this show is that such small scenes can teach you so much about the characters as well as being incredibly entertaining as a whole the show is ridiculously well cast i think one of the reasons it works so well is that we can believe so completely in the characters as for arya and the hound  i knew this was going to be good because i loved it in the books but even so it surpassed my expectations it was simultaneously hilarious and tragic  arya has been forced to unite with a man that she hates hated and is almost subconsciously finding that hatred fading i think its because they both now have something in common in that they have lost their sense of purpose the hound spent his life serving the king and now that he has left that behind he is a man without real purpose other than survival while aryas goal has always been to reunite with her mother and brother and that possibility has been taken away from her i am a little bit tired of all the sexposition but im also used to it i did think the whole naked prostitutes thing was a bit unnecessary even if it was also completely typical of the show they do seem to like making random and unimportant female characters take their clothes off whenever possible i dont buy that it was necessary to the scene or to the character development of oberyn and ellaria but never mind im not really looking forward to the reintroduction of bran yawn theon i wish theyd follow the books in this respect the less theon we get the better and melisandre or to the arrival of the rest of the greyjoy clan though i did enjoy the fact that this episode didnt feature any of my least favourite characters also am i alone in finding it increasingly difficult to root for dany "

"251" "VonSparron" 2014-04-08 " firstly a compliant  after a years wait and feverish anticipation an hour just is not long enough lets have a double length ep01 for season 5 hbo i thought this was a cracking first episode oberyn martell is going to be a lot of fun to watch nice to see him being even handed in his treatment of men and women  they are all sexual objects to him unless they are lannisters in which case he wants to kill them the hound and arya make a great if disturbing double act its interesting how the male role models in aryas life have shaped her syrio forel taught her how to fight and not be afraid jacquen hagar showed her how to kill and it looks like shes learning to enjoy it from the hound sinister stuff the magnar of thenn was creepy the new actor playing daario naaharis is much much better cast those dragons are getting a but feral jon snow was lucky to keep his head with janos slynt and ser alliser thorne judging him where are stannis and bran roll on next sunday "

"266" "longtimelurker93" 2014-04-08 " delighted to finally contribute to this blog after catching up with got over the past month or so hence the user name initial thoughts are that it was a strong opening episode my highlights were the introduction of oberyn martell tyrions awkward position within the realm jaime standing up to tywin and last but not least arya getting her revenge with her beloved needle i have to give sophie turners performance a mention as i think she portrayed sansas grief brilliantly curious on the significance of the necklace given to sansa by ser dontos as well as jaime metaphoricallyliterally closing the book on his bad deeds "

"324" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-08 " the game of thrones opening is definitely up there interestingly enough this year has already brought us two new series with openings that might be even better true detective and black sails also i recommend checking out a great opening from a canadian series durham county just google durham county opening theme i only wish it were longer than 40 seconds i havent yet seen black sails i dont have starz but i was happy to see the music was composed by bear mccreary who composed among other things the music for battlestar galactica though mccreary didnt do the opening theme for bsg both black sails and durham county have good title sequences as does true detective all of these shows check the right boxes for me they have good original music an interesting graphicintensive opening sequence and they mostly dont feature the actorscharacters featuring the characters in a title sequence is something that you almost always see with procedurals and some of those work quite well like with house and law  order  both using the everyone walking down the hall shot comedies often feature the actors by putting the names next to the pictures but i see this as often being a copout see community which despite being a halfhour comedy feels no need to show the actorscharacters as good as the title sequence is for black sails et al i do think that the opening for game of thrones is set above most other shows primarily for the reason touched upon by jonnytheshirt above being a fictional world showing a map is really handy to give us an idea of where everything is and by changing from time to time which cities are featured on the map it gives up a quick idea of how the story has progressed one of my favorite openings comes from the sopranos which may seem to violate one of my rules by showing tony the whole time but by having him drive from manhattan across the bridge through all the different neighborhoods and finally arriving in his upscale neighborhood at his big house gave us some geographical and socioeconomic perspective "

"410" "candylilacs" 2014-04-07 " in the book daario has a gold tooth and a dyed beard i think not exactly everyones cup of tea mine included it wasnt just that he was considered goodlooking but also had that badboy dangerousness about him the kind thats kryptonite to 1617yearold girls all over the world "
"411" "MRONeill" 2014-04-07 " i havent read the chapter id prefer to wait for it allshe says daringly  but wasnt she repeating what polliver said to lommy when killing him and to arya when taking needle from her "
"412" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-07 " or maybe i am wrong "
"413" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-07 " as far as im aware the reasoning for doran not being at kingslanding was the same due to his poor health although its been some time since i last read the books "
"414" "MRONeill" 2014-04-07 " so that was the mountains damage across the burning countryside at the closing of the episode "
"415" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-07 " he was the one invited as the senior dornish prince sending his incredibly violent vengeance obsessed younger brother in his stead is liable to be seen as a snub by tywin "
"416" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-07 " well hello you "
"417" "Clariana" 2014-04-07 " i dont think oberyn cared to explain yet he was too busy having a pissing contest with tyrion "
"418" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-07 " off topic but after the episode on hbo they aired the debut episode of silicon valley a 30 minutes comedy about well its obvious by the title it was pretty good actually laughed a few times out loud you lot should check it out a mike judge production httpwwwmetacriticcomtvsiliconvalley "
"419" "MRONeill" 2014-04-07 " true  but i think it certainly shows a potential weakness of dany between that and her trying to calm a food aggressive dragon it seems she still has a lot of learning to do "
"420" "ntofr1" 2014-04-07 " great opener great to have you back sarah hello everyone can anyone refresh my memory as to what the deal with doran martell was a la tv show and not book if it was any different these details are easily forgotten if theyre slipped in around big season events "
"421" "ntofr1" 2014-04-07 " ah westeros i can only think about next weeks episode the promo shows wedding bells in kings landing and stannis being stannisy "
"422" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-07 " it hasnt "
"423" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-07 " if i bother my cats when they are eating they also transforms into dragons true "
"424" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-07 " my first reaction was oh no theres only 9 episodes left "
"425" "ID1375510" 2014-04-07 " never fails to live up to and beyond my expectations i love this show do muchcan i just praise jack gleeson maisie and sophie get a lot of love thrown their way and jack sometimes seems to be overlooked he is doing an incredible job with joffrey i really dont think ive hated a character as much as i hate him and that is true credit to the way jack is portraying him he says hes drawn on joaquin phoenixs performance in gladiator hes got it down to a tee a more perfect joffrey you couldnt hope to find "
"426" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-07 " what i missed that when did this happen "
"427" "DiamondDag" 2014-04-07 " now that ive seen the episode it looks like pedro pascals oberyn is going to be just as much fun as deathstroke loses points for lack of eyepatch though perfectly cast and welcome back great read as ever "
"428" "MRONeill" 2014-04-07 " margery being that blunt and open was a bit of surprise to me  we havent seen her lose her facade yet have we i couldnt tell if it was an out of character moment or just making it clear that even the most pr savvy let loose now and again "
"429" "mikebhoy" 2014-04-07 " more bron please "
"430" "machinehead" 2014-04-07 " awesome first episode sets things up nicely for plot lines to come whilst not stinting on the compulsory got sex intrigue and gore the world is right once more "
"431" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-07 " yeah this were good too "
"432" "MRONeill" 2014-04-07 " agreed  the hounds line what the fvck is a lommy and that entire back and forth between he and arya in the trees was priceless "
"433" "DiamondDag" 2014-04-07 " yeah i understand shes changing and maybe they feel the need to speed that up on the show but i think it would be a mistake to lose aryas more erratic tendencies too soon its only episode one though i might be worrying about nothing ill wait and see "
"434" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-07 " this friend is the unfairness of life in a nutshell this is daario in a nutshell "
"435" "Clariana" 2014-04-07 " the squabbling dragons were great and really really scary taste of things to come danny is the twiglet with the three oversized pitballs who you dont want to meet when youre out strolling very interesting how ultimately most of the plotlines in got turn on sibling relationships "
"436" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-07 " melisandre is smoking hot probably literally too "
"437" "Clariana" 2014-04-07 " and now tywin is hand once again but his golden boy has lost his and wants to remain in the kings guard rather than inherit casterly rock "
"438" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-07 " only things i wasnt sure about were the thenns which ive mentioned elsewhere i am kind of split in regards to the thenns as it may affect the plot further on down but it is a nice reminder that there are savages beyond the wall although in the past i have criticized a change dd has made before only to later see it worked out well if not better so i guess ill have to wait and see "
"439" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-07 " yeah but got kinda wins because its cleverly informative and changes bringing aspects of the story into the map "
"440" "Spacedone" 2014-04-07 " only things i wasnt sure about were the thenns which ive mentioned elsewhere and arya i think for the first time they were a bit off with her the cold way she killed polliver didnt feel right at all i know shes changing but shes always fierce impetuous and hot tempered i hope they dont try and turn her into a cold killer with that stupid smirk shes still just a kid remember what she did at the end of season 3 she took out the coin that jaqen hghar had given her and spoke the words valar morghulis jaqen had told her to do this if she ever wanted to go to braavos to join the faceless men she has seen her family slaughtered and believes that she is pretty much alone now she wants revenge against everyone who has crossed her chanting the names of everyone she wants dead and she found one of them in that inn shes been on this path for a while "
"441" "mixxy1" 2014-04-07 " melisandre is delicious "
"442" "ShrewdOtter" 2014-04-07 " is it my imagination or have the made the hound have less scars this season "
"443" "Clariana" 2014-04-07 " well they may have been making cersei more sympathetic up til now that was because seriously in that scene her treatment of jaime was petty selfish and horrible "
"444" "BenMcCrory" 2014-04-07 " sadly no its mondays at 9pm from now on and there will be ads "
"445" "DiamondDag" 2014-04-07 " well i thought that was a great introduction they settled back in quickly and got things rolling i think youre right sarah they seem to have finally got a handle on the pacing and plot juggling the introduction to oberyn was brilliant they pretty much covered all the important aspects of his character straight off including his motivation for being in kings landing and i like the little details like lifting tyrions chin which is not something youd expect from any of the other players in the capitol and set him apart nicely i also think having jaime back among things is going to be great someone else to shake things up you can already see the contrast with how he talks to tywin as an equal and the way tywin talks to him compared to tyrion and cersei hes a strong presence plus this episode is all about the little wave he gives qyburn with his golden hand made me chuckle there were some great exchanges too the hound with his of course you named your sword but the best for me was i commanded the city watch of kings landing boy and now youre here you must not have been very good at your job jon snow 20 i like you already only things i wasnt sure about were the thenns which ive mentioned elsewhere and arya i think for the first time they were a bit off with her the cold way she killed polliver didnt feel right at all i know shes changing but shes always fierce impetuous and hot tempered i hope they dont try and turn her into a cold killer with that stupid smirk shes still just a kid oh and daario bland come back ed skrein all is forgiven "
"446" "Spacedone" 2014-04-07 " its the little things that i enjoy the most such as oberyn telling the procurer that they needed more girls and then it cuts to tyrion shaking his head and bronn nodding his head enthusiastically "
"447" "Clariana" 2014-04-07 " he was good but his mincing wiggle the scarification and the chains all bought to memory the king of the persians in 300 "
"448" "Clariana" 2014-04-07 " yes tywin took his eye off the ball its no good defeating all your external enemies if you have no allies at home "
"449" "DiamondDag" 2014-04-07 " im actually quite annoyed by how theyve depicted them in particular the cannibalism its possible this is for a very specific reason that will come into play later but at the moment it feels like a cheap shock tactic its hard to really dig into my reasons for hating this because it might wander into spoilers but basically everything we know of the thenns from earlier on in the story suggests they are the very last tribe of the wildlings that would resort to such things in fact they are the complete opposite and stand out among the other tribes by virtue of being the most civilized people north of the wall that would have been interesting a tribe that broke the conventions of how the south viewed wildlings with laws and culture not one that just confirms their fears turning them into cheap boogeymen would be a tragic waste but their introduction doesnt leave me much hope "
"450" "jimmy_mac" 2014-04-07 " hes at least bisexual he had sex with melisandre and sired the shadow spirit that killed renly "
"451" "sydneysider28" 2014-04-07 " well now that cersei doesnt fancy him anymore maybe he wouldnt mind "
"452" "Debsta81" 2014-04-07 " second that request for a nashville blog i think sarah would do an awesome job of that "
"453" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-07 " nihilist "
"454" "Debsta81" 2014-04-07 " i didnt think it could get better than jaime telling tywin to shove his rock up his arse but then oberyn came on and there was so much menacing sexiness on my screen my laptop nearly overheated perfectly cast also loved indira varma absolutely smouldering up the screen as ellaria i found her a bit ordinary in the books so hopefully they can flesh her out a bit cersei  what a cow you took too long  he was in bloody chains for 2 years you ungrateful whore the thenns  was worried they were going to leave them out and here they are creepier and more menacing than i ever imagined amazing loved that we got to spend some time at castle black i have missed it so sam absolutely broke my heart with his sometimes i want to hate you to jon nice to see lord snow having something to say rather than trudging around the country side being told how little he knows and lovely maester aemon schooling slynt and thorne on how to identify a liar i grew up in kings landing amen i was going to give jaime line of the week for his are you sure were not related ever since ive been back every lannister has been a giant pain in my ass but then the hound came and totally badassed everyone under the table i understand that if any more words come pouring out your ct mouth im going to have to eat every fking chicken in this room boom i dont think i blinked once during that tavern scene incredible arya getting her vengeance on at last you go little one stick em with the pointy end that creepy little grin she did at the end when she was on the horse was just superb if she doesnt make it to the end as a teenage assassin killing anyone who betrayed the starks im gonna be mighty pissed at grrm "
"455" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-07 " persevere it gets more interesting as a sort of afghanistaniraq allegory later on "
"456" "davidjones2492" 2014-04-07 " that line what was it you say another word and im going to eat every fucking chicken in here priceless "
"457" "lolife67" 2014-04-07 " he refers to killing as the sweetest thing "
"458" "MichaelDeery" 2014-04-07 " im starting to get bored of daenerys story it feels like the same thing every season get confronted with evil overcome it and get advice from some dude trying to sleep with her jon snow had the same problem for a while but his story seems to have picked up "
"459" "jimmy_mac" 2014-04-07 " some of the posts today mention the hounds utterance that a man has to have a code as hearkening back to omar in the wire i was struck last night by the hounds shared similarities with wild bill hickock in deadwood  for example the hounds deadeye stare as he speaks the words ct mouth in the table scene was a deadringer for the table scene between wild bill and jack mccall moreover the hound seems infused with the same spirit that hickock had  to just go to hell the way he wants to "
"460" "HonestIago" 2014-04-07 " i loved how it was actually kind brienne gets nothing but abuse from people and one of the most powerful people in the kingdoms is genuinely impressed by her "
"461" "BrenhinesGwenhwyfar" 2014-04-07 " favourite moment for me the way the shot of arya and the hound riding off into an incinerated landscape touched upon the historical events of the harrying of the north what can i say im a history geek all in all a great episode "
"462" "MichaelDeery" 2014-04-07 " it reminded me of vin diesel in fast and furious 6 "
"463" "raeofsunshine" 2014-04-07 " i dont like the thenns they frighten me between the attempted rape and cannibalism of last week on walking dead to more attempted rape and cannibalism it all gets a bit much love oberyn martell id almost go far enough to say he might become my new favourite but we know too well that it doesnt pay to get too attached to anyone on this show "
"464" "Woof73" 2014-04-07 " fck it all right then but this changes nothing i was a hypocrite already first of all i wasnt in this episode which is a bit disappointing though i was mentioned several times the most disturbing of these came during lady briennes scene it is fair to say that my sphincter tightened considerably hey when you live off a diet of mackerel and youre me its never all the way relaxed when she swore vengeance upon me that right there is the greatest threat to my survival a true believer brienne is capable brienne is connected to jamie lannister of all people and brienne is committed shes also said to be plain and unattractive shes me in other words and me i get the job done so if im going down odds are its on the end of her sword my last words in such a situation fair enough the kingslayer feels he has nothing left and is looking for a new code to live by if he picks hers up im in real trouble still theres some comfort in that just ask the hound and speaking of mirror images here comes the dorn patrol it says here pause for laughter oberyn and his woman playing the roles that cersei and jamie used to inhabit before life got in the way or is there more to them than theyre letting on either way assign bronn to the case they seemed to get on was it just me or did anyone else really miss ros in the brothel scene its just not the same without her so is the war over absolutely is the war about to begin absolutely while tywin warms his hands by the fire oh so very smug my thoughts turn to the cold north though i approve of melting one big sword into two more practical that oh and for the record it was melisandre who named my sword lightbringer not me just so were understood cannibals and everything for a moment i thought there were vikings too but turns out its a different actor than the one who plays jarl borg theyll need snow if he lives of course id have hung him if it were me he admitted to breaking his oath other than that its the usual thing after a war wild animals roaming the countryside dragons hounds pollivers you name it things will calm down after the wedding im sure stannis baratheon "
"465" "raeofsunshine" 2014-04-07 " my reaction when the episode finished why arent the episodes longer i need more more "
"466" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-07 " was a bit on the slow side perhaps for me the highlight was the opening scene with tywin melting down neds sword to the tune of rains of castamere complete with suitable gloating expression followed perhaps by aryas slow killing of polliver complete with patented creepychildfaintsmile and monotonenot too sure if oberyn and ellaria are being played on the right side of the depraved bisexual trope complete with accents that remind me of catherine tates language sketch not sure why theyre having cersei reject jamie when as far as i can recall it was very much the other way around but then they do seem to be making her more sympathetic a character in the seriesnice to see mention of duncan the tall and ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning probably the latter to foreshadow a rather melodramatic character in season 5 i am of the night for those who are in the know and to avoid spoileringalso am i the only one who finds joffreys pantovillain level of nastiness now so much fun im quite pleased when his scenes come up "
"467" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-07 " in my opinion its a bigger scandal than jamie and cerseis twincest "
"468" "themanlikedave" 2014-04-07 " looks like tyrion and shae have been rumbled "
"469" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-07 " i mentioned that this chapter had quite a history its true the first draft was written more than a decade ago originally it was intended to be the opening arya chapter after the infamous five year gap her first appearance in a dance with dragons as initially conceived georges blog "
"470" "mixxy1" 2014-04-07 " sounds made up doesnt it cant believe no ones talking about it "
"471" "Foxy888" 2014-04-07 " you have a womans hand you know the one on the fire "
"472" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-07 " i did not see it coming i still dont "
"473" "mixxy1" 2014-04-07 " cant believe stannis turn out to be gay just like his little brother amazing twist "
"474" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-07 " tyrion should inherit as jaime renounced his titles when he joined the kingsguard and cersei is a woman but i think tywin is definitiely one of those people who thinks the rules dont apply to him a gold hand would be a nightmare youd absentmindingly scratch your bum and end up going the full renly "
"475" "setekh" 2014-04-07 " i think weve past the point at which the good guys have bad things happen to them and have now reached the point at which the evil of the bad guys comes back to haunt them jamie  hes based his life on his relationship with his sister and his prowess as a warrior and he finds that both things are now gone or going cersei  she hoped she would finally come into her own after robert died but she finds that the role of queen is taken up by a younger woman while she is forced to marry someone she cant stand tyrion  despite his disgust at his familys crimes he has never been willing to turn his back on them but now he finds them increasingly turning their backs on him helping preserve his familys power at the battle of blackwater seems to have gotten him nothing but more contempt tywin  his older son refuses to follow in his footsteps and hes left with a daughter whose behavior is a public scandal and a younger son who is his lawful heir but whom he despises hed rather see casterly rock destroyed than turned over to tyrion but what choice does he have readers of the book know theres more grief in store for the lannisters "
"476" "FormicaAtomica" 2014-04-07 " cooold bloooded tywin is too much "
"477" "boleyngroupie" 2014-04-07 " i wonder how many episodes it will take to get to the next big death it will be a doozy ive been waiting a year to see jon snow again i was not disappointed hes coming into his own him and dany on the throne "
"478" "Sammed" 2014-04-07 " actually in the books the hound is driven by sibling rivalry his older brother gregor aka the mountain the show touches upon how gregor is laying waste to the countryside and mind you gregor is the reason the hound has half his face burnt off its not a coincidence that the show touched upon moral codes with the hound because this will resurface later on "
"479" "sydneysider28" 2014-04-07 " i guess tywin doesnt think that heirs of tyrion could inherit and joffrey is already king he wants jaime to do what he wants as tyrion and cersei already are one other thing dont you think a gold hand would be quite heavy might not be too practical "
"480" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-07 " dany what a beautiful blue rose you got there "
"481" "hozho" 2014-04-07 " i understand that if hear any more words come pouring out your cnt mouth im gonna have to eat every fuckin chicken in this room you lived your life for the king you gonna die for some chickens someone is "
"482" "HonestIago" 2014-04-07 " the starks lost a sword the starks regained a sword the war is over the countryside is burning and there are cannibals loose damn it i love game of thrones "
"483" "CaptainEllie" 2014-04-07 " pretty sure cersei called margaery something stronger than a witch "
"484" "Mao222" 2014-04-07 " i love my dragon majestys boots    "
"485" "HonestIago" 2014-04-07 " one of the funniest bits im almost sure was an adlib as qyburn left and had his little conversation with cersei jamiencw did this little wave with his golden hand it was a thing of beauty "
"486" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-07 " i love john bradley hes brilliant  at the preview screening he was hysterical also brilliant thennstaste reference wish id thought of that to be honest "
"487" "Simgeo" 2014-04-07 " good to see owen teale back as the amusingly cantankerous alliser thorne with his pathological hatred of jon snow even better now that jon now snaps back at him rather than glowers and sulks should be a good clash for this series i still think hot pie will end up as king hes playing the long game hiding out in a tavern fantasising about desserts until every one is dead except him and sam "
"488" "HonestIago" 2014-04-07 " yeah but jamie is supposed to be stunningly good looking plus hes had a life of privilege and extreme wealth never really suffering in his life which is why brienne was so callous in telling him to shut it when he lost his hand last year daario is supposed to be a mercenary from one of the less respectable companies his whole life would have been one of hardships and close scrapes it should show "
"489" "HonestIago" 2014-04-07 " in the blackwater episode sandor says something along the lines of killing is the sweetest thing there is to bronn in a world where violence is a way of life being good at it isnt necessarily a psychotic thing agree sandor is an almost tragic figure and he undoubtedly feels something for both sansa and arya he is genuinely kind to sansa keeping her from killing herself and joffrey at the end of s1 and offering to take her away at the end of s2 and hes clearly concerned for aryas safety "
"490" "jet199" 2014-04-07 " pretty sure sandor specifically says he loves killing sandor is a bit of a sadist and he lives in a time when it is completely ok to kill people if you or your boss are a lord he also has his own sense of morality and has empathy for others so he is no psycopath hes just hardened or he would see it as everyone else being soft i think his actions are as much down to his culture as upbringing or psychology or anything else if you were a solider and you couldnt kill people you wouldnt be much good and most men in got are warriors of one kind or another "
"491" "EnglishDisco" 2014-04-07 " maybe something to do with a hairnet also  house darklyn defied and imprisoned the mad king  this was a major factor in causing the rift between tywin then hand and aerys as the mad king thought tywin took too long to arrange his rescue aerys killed every member of house darklyn and hollard their vassals apart from ser dontos who was a child and spared thanks to ser barristan he took him to squire in kl this wasnt a major contribution to the war of the usurper  but did have an impact on the lannister allegiance that being said if robert lost at the trident you can bet your dragons that tywin would have sided with the targaryens too much geek overload must sleep now "
"492" "SecondChance" 2014-04-07 " two exclamation marks is probably two too many for such a short and boring post forgive me ive just finished watching the episode and im pretty bloody excited  "

"494" "SecondChance" 2014-04-07 " theyll all be here soon enough theyll probably push this blog after 10pm tonight at the moment only the hardcore fans who have stayed up late to watch it or got up early will be posting on here make the most of a sane and considered blog although to be fair despite the odd annoyance over the last 3 seasons this is one of the best discussion blogs ive found "
"495" "hozho" 2014-04-07 " yeah i thought the same "
"496" "SecondChance" 2014-04-07 " same here now i think about it theyre probably waiting to push this blog until after the 9pm showing has been and gone "
"497" "SecondChance" 2014-04-07 " yes loved the omar reference i wonder the wire and got are my two favourite shows because they both do an excellent job of showing that the game is always bigger than any one person no matter how well they play it and the game everyone thinks theyre playing as always part of a bigger game on a hound related note have they softened the scarring on his face in this series it seems less red and angry than it did in previous seasons maybe its deliberate to help the viewer warm to him or maybe its deliberate and is a sign that the hounds relationship with arya is healing some of his childhood pain or maybe its just my imagination as i love the hound so much now a mans gotta have a code "
"498" "YoothaJoyce" 2014-04-07 " ahhhh thrones is back sarahs blog is back and all is right with my world again what with the hounds chicken dinner and the scary thenn epicurean delights itwas like a skewed and fabulous version of the tastewith deaths sarah hughes  i even stayed up to watch thronecast and their interview with the gorgeous john bradley reminded of me your comment about sam larping up a storm  which i am geeky enough to say i still laugh at "

"500" "guardiansek" 2014-04-07 " haha given jaimes predilections that would be the first step to arousal wouldnt it i view you as a longlost lannister cousin and frankly that excites me but i rather think that jaime is not what brienne is looking for "

"506" "candylilacs" 2014-04-07 " as rickibobby said theyre essentially the same thing some believe its more a product of environment others that its hardwired but likely its a combination of both supposed to be glib superficial lack of empathy cruelty to othersanimals narcissistic shallow emotions lack of impulse control i think the hound is actually very good at impulse control "

"514" "doswillrule" 2014-04-07 " which must have been shot long before that was released to the publiceither grrm is sharing some very detailed notes or im suddenly not so worried about them overtaking him "
"515" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-07 " judging by their conversation this episode tywin was likely never keen on his sn and heir joining the kingsguard indeed the mad king elevated jaime to the kingsguard specifically to annoy tywin who promptly quit as hand "
"516" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-07 " i thought it was cool that aryas lines while killing poliver were similar to those given in the mercy chapter that grrm released "
"517" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-07 " i think the whole series will be simultaneously broadcast hopefully without ads i dont think it will i recorded the simulcast hey check me out with all the lingo on sky and set it to series link but it hasnt picked up episode 2 next week so i think were back to 9pm mondays from here "
"518" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-07 " no youre right hot pie stayed at the inn to make hot pies "
"519" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-07 " really enjoyed that they got the pace just right for me building to some satisfyingly gruesome retribution visited on polliver highs  arya and the hound the return of alliser thorne and janos slynt the new daario nahaaris a million times more believable than ed skreins wig the way they keep finding new things to do for bronn hes picked up a few minor characters story lines along the way which is all to the good and the shared joke between him and oberyn recognising each other as ruthless killers was a great moment lows  its a relative low but the story does drag a bit whenever we drop in on dany hopefully a bit more action will liven things up "
"520" "UninventiveName" 2014-04-07 " no i think youre right psychopath was the wrong word to use i did consider sociopath but ultimately hes a more interesting character than either of those words suggests to go a bit offtopic could someone tell me if there is any substantial difference between a psychopath and a sociopath i frequently see them used as if theyre quite distinct often in reviews actually but i seem to remember from reading about them that clinically there is very little difference between the two in fact i thought they were almost interchangeable if anyone can enlighten me id be grateful and yes the hound is a great character "

"527" "Millais" 2014-04-07 " of course you named your sword lots of people name their swords lots of cnts "
"528" "SiccarPoint" 2014-04-07 " excellent stuff from bronn too during his interaction with oberyn you could just see the admiration dripping off him "
"529" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-07 " they give the hound the best lines "
"530" "BenjyUK" 2014-04-07 " im so sad for the hound hes got nowhere to go nothing left to do its nice that he gets to find some comfort in his begrudging protection of arya "
"531" "dsk84" 2014-04-07 " i cant recall from the books but they seem too symmetrical and perfectly formed to be war wounds the thenns were intimidating but not quite menacing enough until the line about trying crow that certainly managed to push that right over "
"532" "Flossiethefloozie" 2014-04-07 " its worth getting up to watch it in the middle of the night for the lack of adverts alone  it just flowed so smoothly last night earlier on id been catching up with true detective and those pointless breaks that sky atlantic put in completely ruined the flow of the show im aware im watching sky atlantic as i had to pay good money to get it so theres no need to keep hammering it in "
"533" "vegeta83" 2014-04-07 " thenns were scary reminded me of hellraiser anyone know how they get their scars is it a ritual or just war wounds "
"534" "vegeta83" 2014-04-07 " i think the whole series will be simultaneously broadcast hopefully without ads but the one later today will have ads "
"535" "SanMiguel" 2014-04-07 " definitely called hearteater in season two from the telly too as he says before going out to the walls for the battle of blackwater bay hearteater ive named it and then gets sansa to kiss it which definitely makes point indeed "
"536" "vegeta83" 2014-04-07 " read the above post from flozie to get to the blog i had to search for sarah hughes i couldnt find it in the got section the top story is julia gillard "
"537" "vegeta83" 2014-04-07 " i had to search for sarah hughes to get to the blog usually its in the got section but as dsk says im glad we kept the trolls out "
"538" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-07 " in season one it was called lions tooth and in the books at least the sword from season two is known as hearteater which rather proves your point "
"539" "BigTex" 2014-04-07 " in preparation i binge watched all three previous seasons one of my favourite moments is bronns quip theres no cure for being a c i find it to be very useful when said to myself at work "

"541" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-07 " hey ive addressed this below but essentially yep agreed psychopath is the wrong word and does him a disservice "
"542" "vegeta83" 2014-04-07 " i prefer this fiery jon to emo jon "
"543" "BenMcCrory" 2014-04-07 " the season 4 opener was powerfully done ably directed by db weiss and looked fantastic and it had no ads which was nice its a shame that the opener appears to be the only episode simultaneously broadcast on both sides of the puddle but i can live with that when it is so good to have got back i particularly enjoyed the hound unleashed his wordplay was as good as his swordplay and i dont normally approve of young girls skewering men and liking it so much but in this case i shall make an exception i look forward to seeing her skewer joffrey one day "
"544" "vegeta83" 2014-04-07 " it is a great twist from grrm the goodlooking white knight is reviled by readers and the people but his actions are actually noble if jaime didnt love cersei he would not have been in the kingsguard he would have married some highborn lady he is a great warrior he would have been one of the most loved and respected characters in the show "
"545" "lolife67" 2014-04-07 " pretty sure sandor specifically says he loves killing "
"546" "paddysdad" 2014-04-07 " thank joffrey its back been through the entire box set on sky in last two weeks in anticipation and it hasnt disappointed the hound is my new favourite character an enigma wrapped in a fkoff big mystery in a killingmachine shaped puzzle lots of people name their swordslots of  which poses a question  whats joffreys sword called as if there is a swordnamer in westeros hes the biggest of them all "
"547" "BenMcCrory" 2014-04-07 " my swords called tickler "
"548" "Annuska" 2014-04-07 " sandor is no psychopath he knows fear and he knows empathy hes just very very damaged and thoroughly disgusted with the whole ideology he grew up in he keeps telling people hes not a knight his brother is and he knows very well what is brother is and that people who call him a knight know it too "
"549" "vegeta83" 2014-04-07 " why have you wikied and linked cold open "
"550" "ChinofJim" 2014-04-07 " but that moan wouldnt be legitimate anymore  if it was before because the episode broadcasts in the uk simultaneously with us and is already available on nowtv in think it was problematic last year when the blog was up before uk transmission but the guardian was in a bit of a damned if guy do and damned if you dont situation so i wouldnt criticise their decision "
"551" "vegeta83" 2014-04-07 " isnt pulling hair and being mean a sign of affection "
"552" "dsk84" 2014-04-07 " its good that way otherwise wed undoubtedly see more comments about another got blog how many more are we going to get are hbosky paying the guardian and so on best to keep the trolls distracted "

"554" "vegeta83" 2014-04-07 " will to power you cant blame tywin for the war catelyn for kidnapping tyrion jaime for ned and then joffrey for executing tywin was the one who wanted to avoid war also jaimes rash actions in the whispering woods got him imprisoned "
"555" "CentralBelter" 2014-04-07 " got has a nice way of sniggering at the conventions of fantasy i particularly enjoyed hounds line about the naming of swords lots of people name their swords lots of cs it was a contrast with jaime moping over the empty pages where his heroic deeds should be  ill be interested how he decides what heroism is going to mean for him "
"556" "ChinofJim" 2014-04-07 " i loved jons snarky put down of janos slynt you cant have been very good at your job "
"557" "Jez Holland" 2014-04-07 " i have trawled through all the comments and not yet seen one complaining about the earliness of this blog posting also i have seen noone posting about not being able to watch the show because they dont own a television and therefore this show must be rubbish because you know it is on television does this mean we are declining into a comments section that may actually be sensible i havent yet seen this episode but have read a few reviews and blogs and i am eagerly awaiting getting out of work and putting my daughter to bed so i can settle down and enjoy this team red viper "
"558" "ChinofJim" 2014-04-07 " its not that hes done nothing of note he did after all kill a tyrant and by doing so prevented a horrific fiery death for everyone in kings landing he didnt do that because he was tywins pawn judging by their conversation this episode tywin was likely never keen on his sn and heir joining the kingsguard he did it because he was appalled at the mad kings intentions and the suffering it would cause the problem is it is this one thing if note that he did saving countless lives that has left him reviled and mocked the kingsguard book mocks this fact killing the king isnt really the sort of deed you want to include in a chronicle of notable deeds by the kingsguard "
"559" "dsk84" 2014-04-07 " finally ended up watching it and it certainly lived up to the anticipation agreed with the review that the best moment was the shot of joffreys statue standing over a dead wolf very much what youd expect from a tin pot dictator though the moment that had me laughing the most was the hounds what the f is a lommy as someone who read the books between season 1 and two of the show i felt i was picturing a lot of characters as they were portrayed in the show so it was always going to be interesting when characters that i had read were introduced daario especially the original did not work how i pictured him after reading though the new one works a lot better but just after the first scene with oberyon i really cannot imagine him in a different way had the perfect combination of charm and danger and am very much looking forward to more of his scenes in the future one thing i did like about this opening episode was that the didnt bother showing every single story arc that is happening  in addition to stannis the left out bran rickon reek and the brotherhood theyll no doubt visit them in the next episodes but this way they allowed enough time for the arcs that were shown which i think is the way to go otherwise everything seems a bit rushed as was the case with the season finale last year i was telling someone yesterday how much i seem to enjoy joffrey in a show with so many shades of grey no not 50 it is somewhat refreshing to have a character that is just a pure douche and you dont feel guilty about hating at all tywin you sort of have to respect but not joffrey despite or perhaps because of his opinion of himself hes far more his mother than his father with him thinking hes better than he actually is "

"561" "vegeta83" 2014-04-07 " harsh to call sandor a psychopath he is a great warrior and enjoys killing but in general he does have a code and empathy his brother is a psychopath "
"562" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-07 " oh me too and then i had a near nervous breakdown when i tried to rewind back to check and discovered hbo preview discs arent happy when you do that "
"563" "jacjac" 2014-04-07 " i think it was a one off the sky atlantic tv schedule for got tonight has a 900  1015 slot  more than needed for a nonadvert version "
"564" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-07 " cont has a cutting sense of humor but nobody will fear him without his sword hand and hes one of the most reviled men in the realm "
"565" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-07 " that was the point of the half empty page in the book of the kings guardnbsp jamie had done very little of note because hes spent the first 40 years of his life being tywins pawn he talks big and "
"566" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-07 " i think their intro was well done and ups the ante of the wildling attack after jon had gotten all matey with thormund and ygritte the cannibal piece was a reference to the fact that beyond the wall there are things they no longer believe down south and omly exist in old nans tales of blood drinking wildlings the reaction of janos slynt to jons suggestion that mance had a bunch of giantess betrayed the same pointnbsp north of the wall is not another land its another world altogether "
"567" "Flossiethefloozie" 2014-04-07 " why has this blog all but disappeared from the main tv page yet that rubbish about julia gillard has the main spot "
"568" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-07 " you gonna die for a chicken somebody is "
"569" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-07 " oberyn is like tyrion crossed with jamie smoldering violent and possessed of a devious low cunning unlike most you feel he might quite enjoy playing the game of thrones i actually found the melting of ice quite sad to watch but its interesting that just as tywin gets everything he wants you can see his carefully woven plans starting to unravel jamie wants to put his own honor before the family schemes for once  tyrion wants nothing to do with him cersei seems to be sinking into a goblet of wine and just as he destroyed house starknbsp he has found a new rebellious upstart who wants bloodnbsp this one doesnt appear to big as hung up on honor as the last foenbsp let the games begin "

"572" "Redscum" 2014-04-07 " the confusion wrought on his face when tyrion passed up his offer with im married was priceless "
"573" "Muppet_N2" 2014-04-07 " i loved this episode a couple of points im finding daenerys as an increasingly unpleasent and selfish character daario broke an order but is forgiven because hes pretty and i dont know if im reading too much into it but it was curious how all the swords were being wielded while the one of the characters were sheated it seems a metaphor of a posttraumatic experience the characters are unable to have sex and are only able to kill the other its weird in a game of thrones world where the characters have sex anytime they can "
"574" "98smithg" 2014-04-07 " my mistake it is hollard as you say but they were a vassal to house darklyn that battle was one of the primary contributing factors to the war though "
"575" "ChinofJim" 2014-04-07 " with the starks and stannis beaten the lannisters have literally reforged westeros but i thought the telling bit was that he waited until jaime was back who i would suppose is tywins anointed successor  his legacyof course jaime has other ideas "
"576" "dsk84" 2014-04-07 " agree about true detective and black sails  black sails in particular dont think i could have imagined punk meet pirate would have sounded so good but it just works game of thrones is brilliant but id say the video sequence helps elevates the music as it works even better in combination "
"577" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-07 " ooh an arrow reference nicely done "
"578" "DiamondDag" 2014-04-07 " ill be watching this tonight but by now im pretty confident in the quality of this show however the landscape of tv has change since the last series we now live in a postmanu bennettslade wilson world and as such all thoughts of badassness have to be redefined if your characters cant undermine the hero with a simple smile and gravely voiced kid then you need to rethink the direction of your show the bar has been set red viper "
"579" "OldhamA" 2014-04-07 " one of the story arcs in the books is how the lannisters lost their valyrian steel sword one of tywins uncles went off with it across the narrow sea i think i agree that tywin melted ice down as soon as was it was feasible politically "
"580" "ACertainBang" 2014-04-07 " the last scene with the hound and arya was this show at its best interesting stuff with sansa also is this the season that theyll let her have a personality and jon snow showing some balls too a strong start for the starks "
"581" "sydneysider28" 2014-04-07 " jaimes little wave was good it seems like hes starting to get a bit annoyed about being pushed around by everyone when he tries to do the right thingand joffrey who doesnt know who jamie really is to him was being especially meanbut much as i like jaime still have to remember that he pushed bran out of the tower and has been having twincest for years arya and the hounds journey is shaping up nicely  def the new brienne and jaimeand joffreys wedding is soon  2 weeks they said that must mean in the next couple of episodes we know what happens at weddings in this show "
"582" "OldhamA" 2014-04-07 " too good looking youve seen the guy that plays jaime lannister right "
"583" "OldhamA" 2014-04-07 " honestly it was the teeth of the old daario "
"584" "LostTransportation" 2014-04-07 " dont disagree as daenerys was the partner of khal drogo just being pretty wouldnt be enough for her story arc logic "
"585" "ACertainBang" 2014-04-07 " are you sure were not related big hint that jaime is going to put the moves on brienne now cersei has given him the cold shoulder "
"586" "OldhamA" 2014-04-07 " inigo montoya is a perfect summary of the red vipers character bravo sarah didnt warm to him in the books hes slightly more likable in the tv show "

"588" "Flossiethefloozie" 2014-04-07 " i thought that ed seemed a bit cartoonish so im quite happy with michael he just seems to be more suited to the role "
"589" "Ardbroilach" 2014-04-07 " hbo is a subscription channel so no advertssimulcast means we see exactly what goes out on hboi think "

"591" "Beetlegeuce" 2014-04-07 " brilliant for all the talk of the violence and nudity a lot of people seem to forget that its also bloody hilarious i counted at least five quotables in that episode alone "
"592" "Flossiethefloozie" 2014-04-07 " it was a very welcome improvement "
"593" "Flossiethefloozie" 2014-04-07 " a small bit of stark revenge via arya the north definitely remembered "

"595" "ChinofJim" 2014-04-07 " i read the sword thing the other way someone other than tywin might have melted down nefs sword a lot sooner tywyn waits until the war is won and his son is returned to safety "
"596" "LostTransportation" 2014-04-07 " i did want to know his product regime as being able to have hair that immaculate after a nights swordplay and sacking of a city has to be worth it agree with candylilacs that ed was much prettier than michael "
"597" "ChinofJim" 2014-04-07 " i like the fact their hostility to the lannisters is so up front and centre it adds a great new dynamic to kings landing and besides you get the impression that oberyrn isnt someone who does politessealso bringing up the story of oberyns sister and his niecesnephews immediately juxtaposed with sansas frozen grief and aryas cold blooded murder reinforced the impression of the lannisters having been involved in some pretty dicey stuff rubbing a lot of people up the wrong way "
"598" "grandcanalman" 2014-04-07 " great to have the blog back great first episode especially cool to have more of bronns quips "
"599" "dhulmes" 2014-04-07 " i also missed stannis and his legendary grimacesoh well heres hoping for next week great season opener loved our introduction to both prince oberyn and the stenns the definite daario upgrade a small bit of stark revenge via arya also enjoyed jon snow putting down janos slynt at the wall not sure if he knows about his betrayal of ned but itll surely come up at some point "
"600" "ChinofJim" 2014-04-07 " i dont think that counts as aryas first bonafide kill on the show i guess you can put down the stable boy in season 1 as involuntaryself defence and all the kills at harrenhal were carried out by her request but not by her hand however she definitely chalks up one in the last episode of season 3 when she and the hound come across some house frey men celebrating their part in the red wedding "
"601" "Moreisless" 2014-04-07 " have they got rid of the adverts  im sure there were none or was i dreaming "
"602" "Flossiethefloozie" 2014-04-07 " and the way she just stood there staring after shed done it  not a hint of regret or disgust excellent stuff "
"603" "cybersuperhero" 2014-04-07 " sorry but thats bollocks ser dontos is a member of house hollard as his name suggests and the battle you mentioned wasnt part of that war but never mind "
"604" "Zaichik" 2014-04-07 " i look forward to the return of this blog almost as much as i look forward to the return of the series "
"605" "ChinofJim" 2014-04-07 " i think that was the best series premier game of thrones has had maybe because it effectively is starting halfway through book 3 it has les heavy lifting to do than the other openers certainly wed expect fewer new characters this time around but the ones we did get in oberyrn and ellaria are fantastic and already add an intriguing new dimension to the show "
"606" "marineBLU28" 2014-04-07 " yes great first episode but one of the most pleasurable things for me at staying up to watch it at 2am was there were no adverts breaking it up wonder if that will continue or if it was just for the first episode looks as though its going to be a corker of a series tho  "
"607" "DiddleyDum" 2014-04-07 " its the little things that stick in the mind  like the hound eating chicken as they ride away ps welcome back to sarahs blog "
"608" "Piperboy" 2014-04-07 " very happy were back really liked the episode amongst all of the drama i thought the conversation about chickens was delightfully dangerously comedicuntil it finished "
"609" "LordMeowingtons" 2014-04-07 " not seen this yet so will be watching it after work cannot wait my favourite show has returned i havent read the books and i would love nothing more then to see the starks getting their revenge at some point but sadly i have a feeling that will not happen anytime soon if at all "
"610" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-07 " no i think youre right psychopath was the wrong word to use i did consider sociopath but ultimately hes a more interesting character than either of those words suggestsagree he doesnt care whether he lives or dies as well "
"611" "weewilkie" 2014-04-07 " i also loved her flamboyant technique in cutting down polliver "
"612" "weewilkie" 2014-04-07 " ah could be right itd be joffrey then id imagine i did wonder who dot the smaller sword "
"613" "Flossiethefloozie" 2014-04-07 " it looked much smaller than the one he gave jamie so probably for joffrey or tyrion "
"614" "Flossiethefloozie" 2014-04-07 " i have to say that this was well worth getting up at 2am to watch arya reunited with needle whilst getting revenge for her dead friend  im loving the way theyre taking her character "
"615" "weewilkie" 2014-04-07 " i guess tywin has kept the 2nd sword made from ice the fact jamie got the other just goes to show who tywin thinks is his true heir also the fact that he would tolerate jamie saying no to him unlike cercei and tyrion maybe this favouritism for jamie will be his undoing "
"616" "pipdog" 2014-04-07 " its often the throwaway moments that most impressively demonstrate how much thought has gone into maintaining the internal logic of this makebelieve world witness hard man prince oberyn trailing his hand through a candle flame before his violent confrontation in the brothel "
"617" "Knowles2" 2014-04-07 " good episode what is it with girls sticking pointy things into people necks that make such good tv twice in one week but good fight scene hopefully the hound and arya stick together for a little while longer daenerys dragons needs to be bought under control i love the opening sequence with the swords talk about counting your chickens before they hatch there still plenty of starks left to do plenty of damage to lannisters yet "
"618" "MoreTears" 2014-04-07 " the game of thrones opening is definitely up there interestingly enough this year has already brought us two new series with openings that might be even better true detective and black sails also i recommend checking out a great opening from a canadian series durham county just google durham county opening theme i only wish it were longer than 40 seconds "
"619" "Knowles2" 2014-04-07 " and does anyone else think that game of thrones has one of the best title sequences ever yes hbo generally does good opening sequences which themselves seem to be dying on tv as networks cut them in favour of more advertising time "
"620" "MissGlenghis" 2014-04-07 " i wish that we had a nashville blog my love for it too is great "
"621" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-07 " ha good catch  although darius is always sonny from treme to me despite my nashville love "
"622" "MissGlenghis" 2014-04-07 " id like to note that benioff and weiss having run out of british actors to plunder appear to have started on the cast of nashville that was deacon for sure in the oberon company and darius is of course liam "
"623" "EnglishMike" 2014-04-07 " hate to disappoint but your rapture will be condensed into only ten hourlong episodes of joy "

"625" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-07 " oh also just a quick thing  i know blog has no discussion of thenns and incredibly creepy joseph gatt thats because i want to discuss them in more detail and will do so when we learn more about them as the series progresses "

"628" "dsk84" 2014-04-07 " dont know if hes the saddest but agreed that you do tend to feel sympathy towards him managed to survive a horrifically sadistic brother in childhood only to find that his reputation as an adult is unfairly maligned very much due to the actions of that brother not to mention the terrible injuries caused by his brother which also tend to give people the impression hes a nasty character whereas he was just the victim of one hes no angel but as he told arya there are plenty of people in westeros that are far worse than him "
"629" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-07 " i really couldnt take daario one seriously it was the hair mark 2 seems a bit more believable in the role so far "
"630" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-07 " yes basically on saturday night i jumped up on the sofa and went damn im sure that was a direct reference to the wire and the hound is game of thrones omar little but it was too late to change the copy by then "
"631" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-07 " and for a bit of the superficial i absolutely loved the this episodes cold open showing tywin having ice melted down to be made into two new swords the music built and built with a rendition of the rains of castamere and then flowed right into the main theme brilliant and does anyone else think that game of thrones has one of the best title sequences ever "
"632" "ThePlayerKing" 2014-04-07 " lots of people name their swords d "
"633" "candylilacs" 2014-04-07 " i dont think the new daario is too goodlooking the other one was very pretty besides daario is supposed to be goodlooking and thats why dany falls victim a big strong handsome guy and shes a hormonal adolescent girl shes supposed to be about 1617  its a natural attraction if she were older and wiser it wouldnt be "

"635" "98smithg" 2014-04-07 " you could be right dontos is the last surviving member of house darklyn the house which started the original war so he is potentially a player in the plot and it is sort of a chekhovs gun "
"636" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-07 " i find the hound to be the most profoundly sad character in the show "
"637" "candylilacs" 2014-04-07 " i do like how margaery let her true opinion of joffrey come out  how she expected his gift to her would be a necklace of bloody sparrow heads and then being quickly hushed by her grandmother my husband does like jamie and brienne together he said shes the only other woman he spends time thinking about or cares about what she says even if hes mean to her as for sansa being a wet blanket  realize shes supposed to be 14 everyones a bit annoying at 14 that means shes completely selfabsorbed and naturally awash in selfpity now that she has lost her entire family as far as she knows shes a bit out of her meager depths a little worried about arya loving the killing so much though despite that i do think a pony is often the best reward for pretty much anything "
"638" "candylilacs" 2014-04-07 " i dont think the hound is a psychopath hes a killer because thats his lot in life and he doesnt question it overmuch i mean look at his childhood  almost burned to death by his brother who is a true psychopath i dont see that sandor loves killing but it is a means to an end  food money a job gregor his brother enjoys the killing you get that more in the books as well as torture and rape i dont sense the hound was much for the latter he has a little softness for sansa and now even arya who got her pony at the end not just a pony but a pretty white one fit for a young lady its the little touches that show he cares more than he lets on also i kind of get the feeling that now the hound doesnt care much if he lives or dies but he does want his last days on the earth comfortable "
"639" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-07 " olenna tyrells reaction to meeting brienne fantastic "
"640" "guardiansek" 2014-04-07 " i enjoyed this episode though probably not as much as the first episode from the last two seasons great buddy moments between tyrion and bronn brienne and jaime are you sure were not related and arya and the hound sad to see arya and the hound riding into what looked like a warravaged landscape at the end though add that to the list of the conveniently forgotten costs of victory that sarah talked about it was also good to see one of the lannister children tell tywin where he gets off if it had been in character i would have loved to hear jaime saydad ive been captive for better than a year maimed without my woman and im halfway through a difficult reappraisal of my life all because of your will to power seriously go screw yourself i prefer the old daario noharis maybe thats just me i like danys grim determination and fortitude in pursuit of her abolitionist crusade but i wonder if it leads to the iron throne eventually also good to see diana rigg back in form and fussing over her granddaughters public relations campaign the martells i could have done without especially telegraphing their hostility towards the lannisters so quickly this right under the nose of tywin who just brought down robb stark in the end without a battle "
"641" "rickylee369" 2014-04-07 " firstly michael huisman seems too good looking for game of thrones it is like watching a fullygroomed beckham trying to fit in among the smacksoaked kings cross of the early 80’s gawd help ‘im he’s tryin’ what with the folksy charms and protohomoeopathy “this one makes tea this one is poison” but the guy from treme should maybe have stayed in nashville producing glitzy country for the sequinned stars of the opry having said that of course the got people know what they are doing and i’d hate to second guess them… maybe im wrong and the hairspray will wash out in the blood and sweat of battle the biggest event of the episode was the first bona fide kill from arya… she’s always been one of the more intriguing characters and to my mind worthy of the iron throne and the leonmathildaesque pairing is working well the hound is now a sympathetic character rather than scary but he hasnt lost his mean streak i for one am grateful that kfc now deliver as that tavern tussle seemed like a barbaric way just to get hold of a bargain bucket sansa… well we are all supposed to feel sorry for her… right personally i find her spoilt and slightly delusional as regards her current status i almost want her to suffer still she’s a pawn in a power play and despite the fact that she is almost singularly unlikeable in this show i am glad she has found a friend even if i suspect that she will end up with a grand prize in tyrion who surely will overcome the odds to take the throne… to me he is the best character in the show… witty charming selfdeprecating flawed powerful but within proscribed limits rebellious and calm among the chaos sansa could do worse… she is expecting prince charming is sure nothing else befits her majesty tyrion is twice the man at half the height please sir… can we have some more joffrey this is a game of thrones unless we can get a perpetual insight into the tyranny of the current ruler why would we care who takes over he can take the piss out of ‘goldfingers’ all he likes but we want to see the pure evil in unlimited power not backbiting and petty insults from a manboy with diminished megalomania “a man must have a code” no not omar little but the hound nice nod to the only hbo show that can top got yes i include the sopranos deadwood and boardwalk in that assessment dany is doing ok despite her adolescent babies kicking back at authority and yes that was a big army who cares about nudity watch it is gratuitous exploitative and cheapens the whole production… however if the dragon mothers interpreter wants to get her kit off… all in all a great first episode there are hints that ygritte let off john sneuuuw with warning shots… that the new guys with face scars are cannibals… that yargs can’t come back from the dead seeya mackenzie crook and that bryn is still trying to catch up with the horsemen on foot which is difficult when your legs are paralysed cersei doesnt want to play doctors and nurses with her relatives anymore… charles dance is milking his role for all the melodrama he can muster nathalie dormer is still gorgeous and diana rigg is a spendthrift as for the two new main characters… not yet caring i have a feeling i underestimate them at my peril a great episode just one complaint i thank the universe for simulcasting got in the ukus but now i’ve got to wait a week to find out what’s going to happen yes it’s event tv but i’d love this as a boxset binge  and no… im not prepared to wait 10 weeks to watch them all in a row though if they keep this standard up i’ll do that anyway after watching weekly "
"642" "dsk84" 2014-04-07 " wow this is out early today i havent seen it yet as it comes out pretty much during the middle of the working day in sydney i woke up this morning with a sore neck and was incredibly tempted to use that as an excuse to call in sick just so that i didnt have to wait till the evening however i realised that would set a bad precedent for the rest of the season and dragged myself out of bed i am really looking forward to see how the new characters are introduced  namely the viper and how the big events of the season gets built up i was talking to a cousin who had read spoilers so asked if he knows whos getting offed this season and he had totally the wrong idea about some characters was tempting but avoided fixing his misconceptions anyway the rest of the day cant go by quickly enough "

"653" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-07 " same problem i had but thats the good sort of problem "
"654" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-07 " so now that ive read the article let me say that its nice to see sarahs game of thrones blog back for another season a few thoughts i was skeptical about the casting of pascal as the red viper of dorne but if anything he made the character even more compelling joseph gatt as thenn was downright scary he even put thormund back on his heels a bit though he didnt seem to scare yigrette as much as he hoped he would and arya stark taking her bloody revenge made for a perfect ending to the episode maisie williams sardonic smile as polliver choked on his own blood was chilling "
"655" "rickylee369" 2014-04-07 " i generally like to get my comments in nice and early on season recaps but first i think i need to compose myself stop grinning from ear to ear like a loon and conduct an imaginary orchestra to the theme tune a few more times "
