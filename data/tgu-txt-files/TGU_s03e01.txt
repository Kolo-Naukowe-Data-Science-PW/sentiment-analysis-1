"11" "Woof73" 2013-04-05 " scandibaby  i want to make it perfectly clear that i am not brooding i am deep in thought kings do this from time to time it is perfectly acceptable kingly behaviour especially for the one true king and especially after the one true king has been on the receiving end of a bewilderingly hard slap from a sneaky midget the night may be dark and full of shadows but blackwater bay is green and full of the melted faces of my men so i am deep in thought it was great to see my bestest mate in the whole world davos again though im absolutely over the moon which is why i would have thrown him in jail whether hed tried to gut melly or not  we cant be showing favouritism now can we stannis baratheon ps thank you all for your kind words im sure ill make you regret them someday "

"20" "5432Hun" 2013-04-05 " diamonddag  i think youre being a bit ridiculous and unfair in your criticism the context of my post makes clear that i do not view grrm as a beast of burden in any way my comments about his death are purely a response to the oftheard whine about the risk of him dying before he finishes the book whether it was clear or not from my post of course his life is more important than the books but  even from the skewed perspective of those who worry about this  it is also a pointless concern because its the same risk with any author and the books will surely be finished anyway however one more point i also find the sensitivity which some people react to these discussions a bit over the top im sure the man who coined the phrase valar morghulis is aware that he is like the rest of us mortal "

"63" "5432Hun" 2013-04-03 " sarahhughes  to be honest i wouldnt credit emelia clarke with any great acting chops but i do have sympathy for her for the simple reason that her story in s2 largely involved her having to be surprised about magical things and wondrous cities which cant be easy from an acting point of view i think kit harrington is doing fine hes sulky petulant and has a chip the size of westeros on his shoulder but then thats the character i must confess to havign a huge mancrush on him mind you so maybe im a bit biased "

"75" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-03 " crooky  yes i think thats a very good call  they do seem less fleshed out and its also possibly because their characters are closer to mythic archetypes ie the lost princess the wouldbe hero with mysterious origins which can be less interesting than other more complex characters i think clarke and harrington are doing a perfectly good job in less easy circumstances i also think robb  the king in waiting  has a similar problem "

"93" "Coombsy1989" 2013-04-02 " this time last year i was living in france and was wading in to say stop this whole silly discussion about when the damn blog is posted im now back in england and think the same theres no point moaning about it being posted when it is because the grans editorial team simply do not care rant over great episode which sets the dominoes in place looking forward to seeing danys growing power in slavers bay "
"94" "LondonJazz" 2013-04-02 " i cant believe the harsh words for danys character or for emilia clarkes acting she is supposed to be portraying royalty not some ditzy teenager and imo she plays it perfectly i agree in s2 the where are my dragons got annoying but it didnt happen like that in the book house targaryen all the way "

"98" "Ardbroilach" 2013-04-02 " sunnyone  and astapor was added for the first time for this episode "
"99" "Crooky" 2013-04-02 " is the problem with dany and jon because theres mystery about their pasts and futures whereas the other main characters seem more transparentyou feel with those two that grrm intends some major story arcs that will effect the whole series so they come across a bit like ciphers "
"100" "LondonJazz" 2013-04-02 " benjamin86  thanks for the reply saved me from doing it "
"101" "Clariana" 2013-04-02 " jennifera30  oh who knows "
"102" "MoreTears" 2013-04-02 " hbo today announced that the series is renewed for season four since there was never any danger of cancellation this is a formality but hooray anyway "
"103" "sunnyone" 2013-04-02 " sarahhughes  did you notice also when cersei went to tyrions room how very wary he was of her when she started to go towards him he moved out of the way pretty sharply but she was only heading for a chair hes trying so hard not to show his insecurity but hes having to work at it "
"104" "ntofr1" 2013-04-02 " sunnyone  yeah the credits sometimes change episode to episode "
"105" "DiamondDag" 2013-04-02 " sarahhughes  no i completely agree they really didnt get their heads around jon or danys stories in s2 and i think its weakened the impact of the wider stories being told at the wall and away from westeros of course there is the element inherent in both their portrayals that jon and dany are growing up differently to others theyre both teenagers out on their own in strange places with no real support loving family and both have some serious baggage to work through they perhaps compare unfavourable to arya who we see striving to cope with a horrific situation while jon and dany pout and whine but arya is a huge exception dany has had a strong start its time for jon to grow up too "
"106" "Pixel42" 2013-04-02 " sunnyone  im sure it will be back next time part of an episode is set there "
"107" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-02 " sunnyone  and yet this show is often better in its quieter moments the look cat gave robb in what was otherwise not much of a scene for example "
"108" "sunnyone" 2013-04-02 " sarahhughes  i think you see sedate the same way i do sarah but im definitely getting the feeling from some of the comments that some people didnt enjoy the sedateness is that a word of this episode and are hoping for more action to come "
"109" "sunnyone" 2013-04-02 " did anyone notice that theyve taken pyke out of the opening sequence in series 2 i loved it when the little bridges between the towers did their little bounce "
"110" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-02 " diamonddag  good points i have to admit that even when reading the books i incline more to the political stuff but youre right that the shows strength lies in the way it uses the fantasy elements part of the problem for me with both jon and dany is that i dont think the shows writers have as much of a grip on their storylines because they are more removed from the main plot both in actuality and in feel too often it can descend into them wandering around on endless journeys repeating themselves that said its the first episode of the third season and anything could happen i already found danys storyline more compelling than last year "
"111" "timestamp" 2013-04-02 " ntofr1 02 april 2013 1103am were called to set by raven yeah i laughed out loud at that one it was actually a pretty peculiar interview as it seemed to be insidejoke after insidejoke most interviews of that sort only exist to sell a show or movie to an audience who hasnt seen it yet but stewarts interview of dinklage wouldnt have made sense to anyone who wasnt already a fan which was just fine with me "
"112" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-02 " sunnyone  i dont actually see sedate as a criticism i feel the stand first made it read like that but i liked the slower pace precisely because we got to hang out with the characters as i think the blog makes clear "
"113" "sunnyone" 2013-04-02 " harshcritic  i just wonder what the people who are saying it was too sedate are actually wanting do you want battles and heads being chopped off and armies marching all the time sedate is good for me as it gives me time to take it all in and it gives the characters time to develop imo it doesnt need to be all action all the time "
"114" "timestamp" 2013-04-02 " sarahhughes 01 april 2013 1008pm benioff and weiss clearly want ros and shae to show what it was like for women who werent the ruling class i think that shae used to be when shae is first introduced she and bronn and tryion are playing a truthbased drinking game and every time tyrion took a guess as to shaes past that wouldve indicated poor or humble beginnings he had to take a drink and her demeanor doesnt seem to match her current lowly station in life now she may have been lying to tyrion when they first met and not everyone carries themselves with the bearing congruent to their classbut my guess is that shes a noblemans daughter ran away from home but ive been wrong before "
"115" "FormicaAtomica" 2013-04-02 " 5432hun  that makes perfect sense dany practically goes on a gap year or 5 around this time basically skimmed her parts in the books looking forward to see what else they bring forward with dany could have saved george a year of writing if it had happened so quickly in the books "
"116" "timestamp" 2013-04-02 " 5432hun 02 april 2013 1112am as well as being of questionable taste its illegal in some countries including the uk to show underage characters having sex even when the actor playing them is an adult dont quote me but i believe that is also true in the us as i understand it child actors are prevented from engaging in even simulated sex on screen therefore the sex is either simply implied or a body double is used minors can perform sexually suggestive roles and can even show nudity its just actively performing a sex act which cant be shown which would probably be just one of many good reasons why hbo chose to make the characters older for the show  apparently a then 12 year old dakota fanning appeared in a tiny little movie that no one saw called hounddog in which she was in a rape scene in which a body double was not used however the scene was dimly lit and only showed her face and hands "
"117" "DiamondDag" 2013-04-02 " sarahhughes  youve said you find it hard to get involved in the stuff going on beyond the wall but i think the show needs an element which is more fantastical to counter the political side the giant was a nice touch along with mance rayders rather eclectic bunch of friends they just need to make jons story more compelling the same goes for danys story really its something a bit more exotic that takes the show beyond what can sometimes look like an episode of the tudors thankfully so far theyve managed to make everything feel coherent and part of the same world although the use of the others at the end of s2 felt like a bit of a jolt they dont as yet feel menacing enough for me "
"118" "avdotya" 2013-04-02 " 5432hun  the fact is littlefinger would have spent far more energy on noticing catelyns daughters when they were at court than tywin who wasnt there much anyway and other than a haircut and shabby clothes she looks no different now than she did then i completely agree that the writers at no point made it concrete that littlefinger knows its her but once hed got over the shock of her being tywins cupbearer and just bearing in mind that human facial recognition is naturally pretty good and hes a particularly observant specimen i just dont see how he wouldnt have clocked it its not like she had some excellent disguise a different voice and a different bearing youre right that it could be a massive red herring and ill be the first to admit that i was taken in but its also distinctly possible that baelish has this on the backburner and hes going to bring it into play as and when he needs to "
"119" "harshcritic" 2013-04-02 " i agree that it was a bit sedate i just hope it gets going quicker than season 2 did "
"120" "PCMonkfish" 2013-04-02 " cracking episode this will fill the gap when spartacus departs in 2 episodes time and why no spartacus blog this show and final season has been fantastic  much better than walking deadtoo much t and a for the grauniad "

"125" "Greenseer" 2013-04-02 " just wanted to say that i lurked about on this blog all through last season and enjoyed all the comments from the regulars thank you so much to sarah for making the blog and for her recaps i intend to put in my two pennorth this year not too much to say about the first episode  i would agree with sarah that it was sedate but as a book reader i can see how it has set up some major storylines for the season ahead and although i am a book reader i am not one of the fanboys who think that martin is the greatest writer that ever was or will be hes a great storyteller  theres a difference having said that im never too bothered about changes the series makes  any opportunity to cut the bloat is welcomed by me as long as the main themes and threads are left intact standout scenes for me last night were the tywintyrion exchange the dinner with margloras and joffcersei and of course  ser barristan returns i look forward to more involved discussions with you all as the series progresses "
"126" "badger1969" 2013-04-02 " its back  yay must admit there seems to be so much packed into every game of thrones episode i never think of it as sedate the sheer density of the story is highlighted by all the stuff we didnt get in this episode arya bran jaime  brienne theon and we got very little robb  catelyn  or sam im pretty sure that all the intrigues of kings landing  no varys pycelle or the dowager countess this week either  would make a damned fine  complex series all on their own and benioff  weiss are somehow weaving about 9 other strands  plus a couple i might have forgotten is yara andor the iron islands still a strand on its own along with it loved seeing ser barristan pop up at the end knew  or at least hoped  it was coming but agree totally that concealed identity doesnt work on tv as it does in book form unless you have the same skill set as jaqen dhgar at least hard to find any negatives with this episode  though i agree with a comment elsewhere that the robb scene was so brief it maybe could have been held back a week but ive loving the margaery stuff already and tywintyrion was also fantastic "
"127" "jennifera30" 2013-04-02 " pod is rather brilliant for all his lumpen shyness dont forget he put a spear through the throat of the knight who tried to kill his master i am expecting great things from him or he will be beheaded before the end of episode two who can tell "
"128" "5432Hun" 2013-04-02 " avdotya  yeah ive thought about whether littlefinger recognised arya i admit its more credible than the idea tywin recognised her but left her in harrenhall instead of taking her hostage but im still not buying it i think the writers are using it as a bit of an audience tease its a bit diffcult to discuss without spoilers but i just cant see what purpose littlefinger knowing arya is alive serves the later plot though i can see how it suits littlefingers purposes in the tv version to pretend and hint to sansa that arya might be alive anyway well see maybe the writers have a surprise or two up their sleeves "
"129" "Clariana" 2013-04-02 " glad theyre keeping pod you cant have enough awkward males in medieval fantasy epics in my view "
"130" "Ed1975" 2013-04-02 " archibaldleach  the main point is to have a character who shows what other characters are like behind the scenes shes had moments with lots of the main characters where they show a side of themselves we dont see elsewhere or taken to extremes in joffreys case "
"131" "Clariana" 2013-04-02 " jennifera30  ummm yes maybe "
"132" "Clariana" 2013-04-02 " jennifera30  the book makes clear that both dany and jorah were understanding the trader but keeping poker faced "
"133" "MoreTears" 2013-04-02 " fatlad  interesting information thanks but still since the original interview gave no indication purefoy was joking one has to wonder if he later just tried to get himself out of a mess after the interview came out his agent probably told him that was a stupid thing to say unless he really wanted to poison hbo against him and rule out ever working for them again in the future purefoy has said that he considers hbo the best tv company in the world so it really would be wise for for him to try and stay in hbos good books "

"135" "Werthead" 2013-04-02 " murrayostril  stephen dillane is killing it as stannis if grrm created a song of ice and fire to be unfilmable then he must have created stannis baratheon to be uncastable an uncharismatic martinet but who nevertheless commands respect and has leadership skills sounds like an impossible contradiction but dillanes done it very well "
"136" "VonSparron" 2013-04-02 " sarahhughes  i agree but theres only so much time per episode and i just wonder if it could have been better spent on the major characters a bit more time with robb at harrenhall for instance that being said i thoroughly enjoy his performance and would love to see him put meryn trant in his place  one of the most dislikeable characters in book and series what i did like from bronn is that he is one of the more honest characters in got as he spells out to tyrion we are friends but im a sell sword  i sell my sword no ambiguity or unknown allegiance there hes just in it for the money "
"137" "RedCat21" 2013-04-02 " sunnyone  no difference whatsoever swoon "
"138" "sunnyone" 2013-04-02 " redcat21  but then againhim killing his cousin was a really really awful thing for him to do it would be so much easier to dislike him too if he werent so damned good looking but that might not make a difference to you   "
"139" "RedCat21" 2013-04-02 " sunnyone  spot on i think jamie is summed up by that line before he pushes bran the things i do for love pretty much everything hes done has been for love taking the white pushing brann a shame that its an incestuous kind of love but still the other thing about jaime is that he doesnt think before he acts hes impulsive and hotblooded and like most of gots characters hes torn between his duty the expectations placed upon him by others and the woman he loves "
"140" "PeteBakewell" 2013-04-02 " jennifera30  any chance she will mature into a great actress over the remaining series i doubt this but hope so "
"141" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-02 " vonsparron  nice post  i really debated how much to dwell on robbs scene its the one i would possibly have dropped until the next episode as it jarred a bit and was very brief "
"142" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-02 " johnnyg79  absolutely spot on the reason this works so well is precisely because it doesnt make a huge song and dance about the fantastical elements they just are "
"143" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-02 " vonsparron  i think increasingly those of us who have read the books have to almost try to disassociate ourselves from them and watch the show as a separate thing tv bronn might well have a larger role than book bronn we dont really know certainly i enjoy flynns performance and am happy for him to have his moments in the spotlight "
"144" "sunnyone" 2013-04-02 " redcat21  i like jaime too i think his integrity grows to the point that we tend to forget about what he did to bran then we remember and it kind of brings us up short the characters in got are intriguing precisely because nobody is totally good or totally bad even the goodies are capable of dreadful actions and the baddies are capable of compassion "
"145" "VonSparron" 2013-04-02 " bakwaas  i like the bronn character too but with such limited screentime for an already huge cast maybe it would make more sense to reallocate that time as you say hes more a bit part player in the books once tyrion loses his position as hand "
"146" "RedCat21" 2013-04-02 " bakwaas  jaime was also my favourite from the books hes so misunderstood what has he ever done wrong ok he did kinda kill the king he was supposed to protect and yes he pushed a 6 year old to his death and yes i guess sleeping with his twin isnt great oh and that time he killed his cousin that wasnt cool and the whole fighting ned thing in the yard not great but apart from killing a king crippling a 6 year old boy sleeping with his sister killing his cousin and almost killing ned he really is quite a good guy he certainly has his own code of honour which he follows hes supposed to be the white knight everyone in westeros thinks hes the black knight but really hes just a grey knight like all of us except for killing a king crippling a 6 year old boy sleeping with his sister killing his cousin and almost killing ned "
"147" "VonSparron" 2013-04-02 " angelamarica  thats a good point re the motivation of the characters sometimes in the rush to fit everything in and move the plot along the reasons why some of the characters behave as they do is slightly lost i guess thats inevitable when you have so many major characters this seems to apply most to dany and jon snow "
"148" "RedCat21" 2013-04-02 " angelamarica  pretty much spot on ive read the books too and dany and jon stories are very much about a personal journey discovering who they are and what they can achieve in this world becausedespite of their status the series tries to show this but its difficult jon looks constantly grumpy a bit like a goth and dany comes across as a bit spoilt and annoying i really enjoyed their stories in the books snows especially but its harder to depict on film dany also suffers from the fact that her story has no direct immediate link to westeros jon at least is a stark of sorts for dany you have 80 of the main story taking place in westeroos all strands being connected to each other somehow and 20 taking place on another continent without any direct relevance to whats happening in westeros it creates a disconnect that some viewers find hard to reconcile "
"149" "VonSparron" 2013-04-02 " clariana  yes i noticed that nice touch "
"150" "sunnyone" 2013-04-02 " bakwaas  i didnt pick up on joffreys softer side hes a smarmy little git and a total coward to boot margaerys princess diana act was just that  an act "
"151" "angelamarica" 2013-04-02 " redcat21  ive only read the books so far  ill now start watching the first two series but from what ive heard from others danearys is not well depicted in the series and jon snows part is also too lightweight danearys is an insecure girl an orphan and has not had a happy childhood in the books she comes across as someone who just wants to have an easier life but must be a queen first and she certainly does care about what happens to individuals in her power jon was made to feel an outsider at winterfell by catelyn stark and is finally finding bonds with others behind the wall slowly coming out of the shadow of robb stark i think the series wont be able to show these back stories and motivations well and perhaps its better not to expect that "
"152" "Bakwaas" 2013-04-02 " my fav character in the books was jaime lannisterwould like to see more of him in this series as to season 3 episode 1 yes it was a fairly sedate opener but the producers have no need to preach to the converted so they didnt need to start the series with all guns blazing they know we are happy to wait for the fireworks so will get all the emotional stuff in early having said that charles dance is tywin captured him perfectly as the ruthless and evil man he is surprisingly joffrey showed a softer side cersei still fantastic as always but margery seems her equal interesting clash ahead dany and the unsullied was interesting but her character still too distant and cold for my liking in the books she was a lot warmer im surprised bronn is being given such a run in the series considering he was just a minor player in the books but he is doing a fantastic job and i wanted to see him rip that thong off with his teeth "
"153" "singist" 2013-04-02 " i gorged on that episode like a khaleesi does a horses heart ive got game of thrones all down my jumper "
"154" "funkymotherpucker" 2013-04-02 " econsgeek  we stole it i mean we paid the iron price "
"155" "5432Hun" 2013-04-02 " johnnyg79  if you enjoyed the first two books then do yourself a favour and read storm of swords at some point even if you have to wait until the books have been covered on tv so as not to spoil your enjoyment sos is by common consent the best book of the lost  and is in two parts so theres lots of it "
"156" "johnnyG79" 2013-04-02 " what i found great is how natural the most fantastical elements seem to gel with the mundane like when that giant ambled over and starts hammering that massive stump or when the cybug hatches and zooms for danny melisandres witch somehow doesnt seem out of place soothing the pragmatic chastened stannis "
"157" "VonSparron" 2013-04-02 " wow where to start firstly im so glad to see this blog back i almost enjoy reading everyones comments as much as i do watching the series in the first place im a massive got fan  ive read all the books watched every episode at least a couple of times and have even started listening to the audio books i approach the series as a sperate entity to the books i want to see my favourite bits in there of course and dont want too many liberties taken but the books as written are far too sprawling in scope and number of characters to film asis and have anything like a cohesive show its also nice to have the odd surprise thrown in and see how things have been adapted right back to s03e01 i thought this picked up the series well where series 2 left off we dropped in on all the major claimants to the iron throne i think the interplay between tyriontywin and cerseimargaery is going to be fascinating to watch play out its interesting that whilst joffrey very much saw sansa as a plaything and was demeaning towards her my initial thoughts are that he respects margaery and wants her to respect him cersei clearly sees shes not going to have everything her own way stannis looked thoroughly defeated and broken on dragonstone the scene with robb was interesting it may have seemed a bit strange but i think was important in showing the seeds of discontent brewing in the northern army camp after catelyns actions and robbs indiscretions it was great to see the astaapor and the unsullied the narrative between daenarys and the slaver via the interpreter were straight from the book and were realised really well what i think sometimes doesnt come across as well in the series compared to the books is that whilst daenerys does want to go home and be queen she genuinely cares about her followers and wants to keep them safe above all else she also has a strong sense of morality see her visible disgust at the treatment of the slaves and her unease at having a slave army i doubt viserys would have cared the one storyline i dont think is being realised particularly well at the moment is jon shows it just seems a bit clumsily handled id be interested to know if non book readers know what he is up to or why he killed the half hand well the half hand let him kill him i hope it picks up because he is one of my favourite characters im interested to see how the branrickon storyline as i understand the characters notably missing from last series will now be turning up late to the party will also be interesting to see what direction the aftermath of the sacking of winterfell will be since that was handled a little bit differently from the books too "
"158" "kellan" 2013-04-02 " lalwende  tywin never got any gratitude for all his hard work so i can see why he wouldnt think tyrion deserves any for one measly battle "
"159" "johnnyG79" 2013-04-02 " dany and joraj did more in that one episode than the whole of season two that kid at the end freaked me out and the dragons looked terrifying can properly see now where the threat from the east is coming from and what en epic battle we have to look forward to eh "
"160" "johnnyG79" 2013-04-02 " from the looks of it i think my decision to abandon the books after a clash of kings is vindicated here as constantly cross referencing throughout the last season left me in need if a serious dose of milk of the poppy the writers know what they are doing and they did an excellent job here they didnt waste a second or a scene the pick was tywin cutting tyrion down to size with some of the most damnable words an unloved son could ever dread to hear "
"161" "basiltaswell" 2013-04-02 " bella79  just dont read the blog till youve seen the episode whats the big deal gah "
"162" "Bellatrixlestrange" 2013-04-02 " ntofr1  5432hun thanks for the responses although thanks to the new embedded comments layout i didnt see them at first agree that fresh comments should bump threads up  are you really supposed to scroll through all the comments to see which have active discussions seems a bit clunkylooking forward to seeing how events shape up at harrenhal with robb tulisa catelyn and the mysterious qyburn having slaked by zombie bloodlust with a belated catchup with last weeks the walking dead im off to that blog now "
"163" "Crooky" 2013-04-02 " i thought the writers and actors did a good job considering that episode was about catching up with what was happening in several different storylines and they only had time to flit between them even with the constraints  alot of ground to cover  they came up with some memorable scenes its so well done it was like easing on an old gloveim going to enjoy jerome flynns bronn more now after his quite different work in ripper streetmance makes more sense to me on screen than in the books because of hinds natural authority and toughness "
"164" "ntofr1" 2013-04-02 " cavelier5  with regards to marginalising characters take osha for example who i expect we will see next ep shes had multiple characters from the book condensed into her character and even grrm thought it was an improvement to how he wrote it "
"165" "sunnyone" 2013-04-02 " mrloverlover  yes its true about the adbreaks its such a pain "
"166" "ntofr1" 2013-04-02 " bellatrixlestrange  yeah shortly before we last saw harrenhall in season 2 arya escaping tywin ordered the mountain to hold it while he rode south robb was expecting to fight when he got there i guess the where abouts of the mountain and the reason for 200 northmen being at harrenhall may not be revealed yet "
"167" "5432Hun" 2013-04-02 " jennifera30  he would have been cast and filmed by now if he was going to appear in s3 i love the character but he doesnt really do much that couldnt be done by someone else so if hes not in s3 i doubt hell be in s4 the reeds are much harder to replace but could be delayed until s3 without a problem "
"168" "kellan" 2013-04-02 " timestamp  i cant wait for the martells but woe we have to  i think they are going to be next season even oberyn itll be so worth it though sand snakes "
"169" "ntofr1" 2013-04-02 " mmmrrrggglll  also im not sure if it has really been mentioned in the show that tywin was hand once before for the mad king before roberts rebellion the line about tyrion having whores in his bed was probably meant to signify that he had coveted and missed the position in court as it was often said that tywin ran the seven kingdoms at the end of aerys reign the books also give a deeper sense of how obsessed the lannisters are with jaime his giving up his right to casterly rock is a source of pain for tywin just as the death of his wife giving birth to tyrion also theres a scene in season 2 where tyrion recounts to bronn or shae what his father did to his first love "

"174" "avdotya" 2013-04-02 " 5432hun  whilst im equally convinced that tywin had no idea who she really was whilst she was his cupbearer i am almost certain that littlefinger did he doesnt miss much but when he was visiting harranhal it would have been too dangerous to try to get her out without alerting tywin to her identity plus he was also trying to broker the lannistertyrrel alliance at this point it does seem odd that hes now letting her wander off but for all we know he has people keeping watch over her "

"176" "5432Hun" 2013-04-02 " lalwende  im fine with what theyve done with robb so far allowing for the fact that they have obviously have limits costs screen minutes etc and chose correctly in my view to simplify the harrenhallbased story line in s2 i dont think robbs infatuation with whatsherface is the strongest element of the show nor the way theyve handled catelyns release of jaime but these arent dealbreakers and the story is still heading in the right direction imho my view is that tolkein purists should grow up these are stories not reigious texts the thing that really annoys me is that tolkein wrote the hobbit as a childrens story then rather than knock off a sequel in a couple of weeks spent years worldbuilding yet the purists would rather that a screen version left out all of that background and instead followed the book episodically "

"350" "SaoilElla" 2013-04-01 " muppetn2 you are a lannister was a sincere point and revealed a very weak part of tyrions personality which is his desperate need of recognition i dont agree  i think tyrion has a perfectly legitimate reason to feel hard done by since he is actually being punished for his heroics which i am sure never happened to tywin for his tyrion would have been cool if that part hadnt happened and wouldnt have looked for praise or recognition also may i say it always feels a little weird to me to talk about characters like they are real people  but hey ho "

"369" "malacara" 2013-04-01 " i wonder if they will find anything useful to do with the character of talisa oona chaplin she didnt get to do much in the first episode and it would be a bit pointless if she will be stuck in the role of the nurse throughout i understand they needed to flesh out robs love interest some more in season 2 but now theyre stuck with her and it would be a bit silly to let her go to waste but kings landing promises to be the most fun part of season 3 treachery hatred and catfights galore "
"370" "Gurgle" 2013-04-01 " im enjoying the series hugely but for me there is one big flaw they desperately need to develope robbs character his character arc is so central to the series it needs developing it just seems that we are spending time on peripheral matters at the expense of the central storyline on a separate note its really hard to talk about this without giving away spoilers however it absolutely has to be done because the thought of spoiling peoples enjoyment at later events is paramount "

"375" "OrpheusLiar" 2013-04-01 " mirthin  the tv shows were never going to follow the books exactly in terms of pacing the way they have split the narratives in certain books on a geographical basis would make no sense for a tv show the material from a storm of swords will be split over 2 series but it wont necessarily follow that everything will happen in the same order hence selmy being revealed much earlier while the red viper is not scheduled to appear in this series at all "
"376" "MaxtonWalker" 2013-04-01 " garymurphy  all fair points its not a totally ideal situation but what with the immediacy of the internet and nonsimultaneous broadcasts in different parts of the world its impossible to do something that suits absolutely everbody i think the main thing is to help people avoid coming stumbling across it accidentally as for spoilers all we can really do is ask people not to  and on the whole people are very respectful of others in that regard arent they "
"377" "Muppet_N2" 2013-04-01 " i enjoyed a lot this episode but i think that the lack of fighting in the fist of the first men was a huge letdown specially because season 2 ended with the huge climax of those things attacking it what happened with the white walker staring at sam how did sam escaped i think that they used the climax to keep us hanged to season three but didnt had any idea on how to solve it anyway great episode for the nudity count i think that it was a great idea to show bronn in a sort of masochistic fashion in his private life all the contrary to the badasskiller that he shows in public and showed a few minutes later an interesting contrast between the man that enjoys being slaped and told what notto do by a woman but that almost get involved in a fight against two armored knights because they merely insulted him "

"380" "Muppet_N2" 2013-04-01 " ninnyhammer  agree with barristan selmy besides the book has too many plots for a tv show and adding another one to game of thrones the misterious old man would have been too confusing for those that didnt read the books "
