"2" "KewlBee" 2011-05-30 " as the series has progressed ive found that im enjoying it more and more started out as pretty much takeitorleaveit for me and evolved into must seeexcept for the gold having the same melting point as wax bit which would have been more terrifying if itd actually looked as hot as it should have been "
"3" "numsi1981" 2011-05-27 " agree with avidfan couldnt wait to watch it but what is the point in starting a discussion now prefer to have a hundred comments next week vestrit7 i think the people here are very careful with spoilers as far as i am concerned when people talk about the next episodes everybody made it quite clear that it is mere speculation speak to you guys on monday  "
"4" "Vestrit7" 2011-05-27 " i tend to agree with avidfan if not quite as grumpy about it  save it for next week just let the rest of us come to it without being told how it begins or how amazing it is in general could people just be a bit more careful about how much information they give from the books and stuff or the hints etc i might be being a little hypersensitive but this is a series in which spoilers really matter ive already had one series the wire season five partly ruined by people giving away a major plot development on a message board id hate the same thing to happen to people here who are enjoying a song of ice and fire for the first time "
"5" "HummDrumm" 2011-05-27 " ps just came across an interview with grrm where he says he is contracted to write one episode each season and this season its episode 8 "
"6" "HummDrumm" 2011-05-27 " well i dont know about tracking down episode 7 i can wait a few more days however i couldnt pace my way throught the book and have to say the end of book 1 is absolutely stunning now pushng on to book 2 should catch up in time for julys publication "
"7" "TAFKAJamie" 2011-05-27 " avidfan your avatar certainly needs cheering up a trip to ros is in order  no fear of people talking about episode 8 early  only the 7th episode got the hbogo weekearly preview "
"8" "avidfan" 2011-05-27 " maybe im just a miserable sod but wtf is the point of people posting on here just to say hey  look at me look at me  ive just seen the next episode online and its amazing good for you but i couldnt give a shit  save it for the next weeks blog i though by then theyll no doubt be telling us how amazing the following weeks episode is "
"9" "MrMydak" 2011-05-27 " the end of the next episode is absolutely amazing it even tops the golden shower "
"10" "littlefox" 2011-05-26 " a great episode i did have a chuckle at one point in particular when a previous comment on season one was discussing the accents used and someone suggested the karstarks would be geordie and we found out that the wildlings are actually the geordies d maybe cheryl cole can find a home on us tv after all peter dinklage is stealing every single scene he appears in he is a fabulous choice for the character of tyrion and is one of the actors who has really settled my heart about the series when i was so concerned that they were filming it a lot of the child actors are fabulous sweetrobin and brandon and arya are all wonderfully believable just a minor point to other commenters on the mediaeval mentality royal men were allowed even encouraged to spread their oats over a wide number of ladies the royal ladies were expected to only sleep with one man and would be executed at the merest suspicion that they had taken a lover as someone else pointed out let catherine howards fate be your guide the reason queen isabella wife of edward ii got away with it with roger mortimer was because she held all the cards against a weak king and then she got her comeuppance in the end it is necessary to understand the sheer depth of double standards between male and female behaviour in that time to understand at least one of the reasons why this secret is so important to cover up "
"11" "ukboy" 2011-05-26 " just watched episode 7 online as good as episode 6 is episode 7 pretty much blows it away on all levels if you have no patience definitely try to track it down online my excuse is that i will be on holiday this weekend having not read the book i keep trying to guess ahead what will happen in the next episode  so far have been totally wrong  which really shows what a great story it is continually impressed with the acting  so many of the actors just seem to be living their characters and hardly appear to be acting at all very impressive for a tv show i guess i agree with some of the above that the cgi budget has been notably missing so far other than filling in turrets of castles and making sets more impressive can large battle scenes be far away tho i think not waiting until the end of the first series to grab the books as i will have no self control at all once i start reading "
"12" "Jebus2012" 2011-05-26 " a tyrion lanister chat show i would watch that "
"13" "JellyRoll86" 2011-05-26 " i laughed out loud at whoever suggested that septa mordan looked like the hen from robin hood another side note  did anyone else think tyrion lannister sounded a bit like michael mcintyre when he was in the sky cell i completely missed what he was saying because i was chuckling away to myself that aside it was a brilliant episode the crowning at the end left me with a weird cold dread that its rare to get these days the scene between joffrey and sansa was also very important and a decent addition cant wait to see a bit more of jon snow and the wall though "
"14" "glitterfairy11" 2011-05-25 " bellatrixlestrange i am very impressed by your selfcontrol in reading the book in weekly instalments id never be able to do that try not to be tempted to read ahead i tried and failed to keep pace with the show i started the book last week and sometime on sunday afternoon i caught up to where the show was at i managed to put the book down telling myself id at least watch on monday night without knowing what would happen next  i think i lasted about half an hour "
"15" "CharlieBronze" 2011-05-25 " i am officially addicted to this show and having learnt that episode 7 was available online i couldnt resist finding and watching it jesus fucking christ it just gets better breathes into paper bag it is electrifying i may have swooned when we finally got to meet a certain patriarch perfect casting as has been mentioned above the nudity level is raised to 11 in this episode but not for the number of bodies we see more for the languid time those bodies are on screen and the candid conversation that accompanies their actions so be prepared to be uncomfortable early on if watching with impressionable childrenparentscliff richards "
"16" "candylilacs" 2011-05-25 " sirjimmy one thing you have to know is that in the tv series all the characters maybe aside from bran and joffrey are about 5 to 10 years older than their characters in the book whether this was done for out delicate sensibilities or because theyre just not that many good underage actors i dont know but daenarys is supposed to be 13 years old at the start robb and jon snow are 17 and 16 respectively even king robert ned and catelyn are supposed to be in their midtolate thirties and both actors are well into their 40s and i think the catelyn actress looks 50 anyway what im trying to say is that many of her actions are based on circumstances and her youth she learns quickly but essentially is still a scared child who has been dominated all her life even in her marriage with khal drogo shes still a pawn westeros capital is a festering pool of corruption ruled by scheming powermad lannisters and any decent person is either smart enough to leave court or stay home in the first place i think were the audience to see if good triumphs over evil "
"17" "shakera1611" 2011-05-25 " i was watching batman begins the other day and that joffrey kid popped up in it gave me the fright of my life  although he didnt look as animatedcorpselike as he does in this i hate to say it but i wasnt taken with this episode the focus on theon and sansa in particular annoyed me as they are the characters that irritate me the most and i was sad to see the brilliant harry lloyd make an exit he plays creepy roles very well loved him in dr who i like that ned has acknowledged that a war is inevitable and has finally grown a pair the idea of war really links in danys story to the main action making those parts a hell of a lot more interesting i think a little link to the wall may have further struck home the point of war as well as the theme of brotherhood "

"19" "numsi1981" 2011-05-25 " thx for the reply got a bit wiser today although i wonder how they made that system work in practice and where they drew the line of giving the defendant the possibility to demand such a trial i guess i will google a bit around the issue  fully agree on the necklace but maybe it was just something like look you are at least as special to me as my mother about the selfcontrol i just enjoy the show so much that i really want to know nothing about what is going to happen even stopped watching hbos sneak peeks if the show was not that good i would just continue reading because it wouldnt matter to me "
"20" "EddieLarkin" 2011-05-25 " httpenwikipediaorgwikitrialbycombat in the asoiaf world the justification for its use is that the gods will decide who wins the duel regardless of each combatants actual prowess its not a sort of gamble that every criminal gets to take in tyrions case as far as the people of westeros are concerned he has been proclaimed innocent of the crimes he was charged with by the gods themselves because the gods allowed his champion to win the duel "
"21" "Bellatrixlestrange" 2011-05-25 " numsi trial by combat was used in the middle ages to settle land disputes and even cases of murder  stupid it may be but its not unrealistic to portray it in a mediaevaltype setting in the book when robert goes off hunting we dont see the actual hunt because none of the pointofview characters is present  they pretty much just say robert is on a hunt like you suggest agree with your point about the joffsansa scene although i think the gift of the necklace does give it a bit more interest and a potential mystery than the simple joff apologises at the tourney version i am very impressed by your selfcontrol in reading the book in weekly instalments id never be able to do that try not to be tempted to read ahead "
"22" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-25 " sirjimmy maybe im reading too much into it but im seeing the first few signs of megalomania her reaction to seeing her brother being scolded to death was eerily calm and with a single sentence she essentially severed all ties to him itll be interesting to see whether daenarys and karl drogo rule as equals or if a schism will develop within the dothraki camp yeah im seeing this as well i sense that maybe she is actually going to use karl drogo and then when she doesnt need him anymore he will be dispensed with thereby completely reversing the way her story began her with her true dragon son ruling the kingdom or whatever it is she wants maybe conquering the land of the fee cities and uniting them all who knows ive also started reading the book and am up to around episode 3 as im going to miss the next two weeks im hoping to catch up and cover these it does certainly give you a much better understanding of the events "
"23" "TAFKAJamie" 2011-05-25 " numsi trial by combat is only an option at the trial stage neds judgment on gregor clegane as shown in ep 6 is essentially the end of the trial not for nothing does he tell ser beric dondarrion to take 100 men with him "
"24" "numsi1981" 2011-05-25 " another great episode the great acting keeps on coming i completely agree that it is money worth spent and i would rather see it this way than putting in into fancy computeranimated scenes so much about the direwolves as soon as i started watching the show i started reading the first book as well i think i have a nice strategy as i read only as far as the last episode went this creates some depth for me but doesnt spoil the viewing experience i guess i will continue with the second book right after the first season though about the joffsansa scene some commentators said that the scene was not in the book i would say it was but just in another setting in the book there is a big feast around the jousting tourney here joffrey apologizes for his behavior and bewitches sansa with some compliments so pretty similar to what we saw on the show i completely agree that this must be cerseis work what is this sneaky bitch planning getting rid of all the starks except sansa to gain control over winterfell the hunting scene i got a pretty bad feeling about this one it felt so unnecessary that they shot the scene at all in the way they did except for showing renly as growing more confident there was not much to it if it was about giving ned the opportunity to make his decisions on the mountain and lord lannister they could have just said robert is on a hunt so i guess we can expect something to happen in the woods hopefully not the kings death i have grown very fond of him and his so not kingly behavior  by the way i think we can all agree that there is never a reason to slap your wife across the face but his remark keep going and i honor you once again is an instant classic the tyrion scenes were once again pure genius his dialogue with mord were really really funny we have to give the producers some credits to characterize mord not as disgusting and sadistic as it is done in the books what i do not understand however is the stupidity of the legal system in westeros which tyrion was well able to exploit for his own good why on earth would you allow somebody to fight his way out of a trail not speaking of being able to use a champion is this something that is reserved for lords otherwise every rapist mass murderer thief could get away with their shit not speaking of the impossibility to bring ser clegane to justice or did i miss a point here did not come this far in the book yet again about the direwolves i prefer them to have a minimal role in the show than being disappointed by how the scenes look i trust the producers in their good judgement on that although the bran scene worked a bit better in the books because the last dude demanded robb to kill the wolves rather than just to let go of his sword but still the scene works perfectly fine for me as it is "
"25" "SirJimmy" 2011-05-25 " cadylilacs ive had a conversation with a friend about daenarys character and had a difference of opinion about where we think its heading we both think she is good at heart but whereas he feels daenarys will rule justly side by side with drogo i feel shell end up going the way of her father maybe im reading too much into it but im seeing the first few signs of megalomania her reaction to seeing her brother being scolded to death was eerily calm and with a single sentence she essentially severed all ties to him itll be interesting to see whether daenarys and karl drogo rule as equals or if a schism will develop within the dothraki camp whatever happens i think this story arch has steadily gotten more interesting "
"26" "JamesWMoar" 2011-05-25 " soujourneressex my feeling fwiw is that he has plotted the entire series and probably written the whole thing as well he goes into a fair bit of detail in a recent post on his livejournal about what he had written when and specifically dismisses the fan theory that he had book 5 finished a long time ago but was holding off on it "
