"2" "NZerDan" 2013-04-14 " sunnyone  if hbo cut out a lot of the not needed tits out scenes and concentrated on the story i think folks would enjoy it just the same and i like tits but there is a time for it if i had not read the books i would be thinking wtf is happening in the show sometimes tbh my wife has not read them and she does not follow it so easy "
"3" "NZerDan" 2013-04-14 " possible spoilers thoros of myr was brilliantly played by the actor it is not hard to imagine him out drinking fat king robert and climbing the walls of pyke with a blazing sword the changes made from the books are so far quite good my only real sore point is ghost not being with jon snowi dont know why is he distasted and fearful of the warg as he is meant to have that power to a lesser extent not really put across in the show though robb has his wolf as does bran and rickon ghost made jons presence in the wildling camp a lot more threatening in the book and gave him more power amongst the wildlings they knew he was the real deal overall though an excellent episode and magic sets they have put together "
"4" "katypie" 2013-04-13 " mirthin  book spoilers absolutely im mostly loving the adaptation but im genuinely annoyed by the handling of jon towards the end of last season and the beginning of this season i think the changes have seriously weakened the character for no good reason in the books  he didnt dither or chase ygritte thus directly lead the wildlings onto the nightswatch he consciously followed orders from qhorin to defect and do what was required of him making his killing of qhorin a far stronger and more poignant action rather than the confused messy scene on tv he gave mance a reason that chimed far more with his character "
"5" "katypie" 2013-04-13 " 5432hun  i have to heartily disagree with you sansa of the books was always fairly weak and one dimensional to me possibly for the reasons linrichardson mentions but sophie turner gives sansa such a lovely dignity and quiet strength that belies her passive victim status sansa of the tv series has become someone that im absolutely rooting for "

"20" "BrenhinesGwenhwyfar" 2013-04-12 " mroneill  i think the series is trying to develope shaes character a little and give her more depth as she is rather tedious and one dimensional in the books in the books as i recall there is no hint of emotional complexity or history for this character shes simply a whore the only vaugely engaging view point of her we see is how tyrion percives her but shes never really a character in her own right given this character development in the show perhaps theyre setting up a more relatable and complex reasoning for her later actions tvshae wins hands down against bookshae imho "

"23" "sunnyone" 2013-04-11 " diamonddag  you got me wrong dd im not at all bored with the talk  im bored with posts that complain about posts that contain spoilers because they refer to eventscharacters in the books and i realised as soon as i wrote my original comment that i was as guilty as anyone because there i was complainingfar from being bored i love talking about the series and as a book reader i would really really like a no holds barred discussion and to hell with the spoilers but as we cant do that although the suggestion that we have two parallel blogs one for readers and one for nonreaders is very attractive although unfortunately impractical then my suggestion is that we all try very hard not even to mention the books and to as you say keep the talk to the events of the episode its not impossible and i back you on the heavy moderation front so i think were both singing from the same hymn sheet actually  "

"102" "Crooky" 2013-04-09 " margaery is interesting she gets told joffrey is a monster and doesnt miss a beat she then sees the monster with a crossbow and uses it to attract joffrey she has a lot of confidence in her ability to manipulate and handle any situation its like she feels untouchable no fear just on the books theres so many characters theres sure to be many we wont see in the tv series "

"148" "VonSparron" 2013-04-09 " i think i spent more time reading this blog than i actually did watching the episode i will probably be sacked before season 3 is out this episode as ever was about the subtle interplay between the characters i loved seeing sansa twitch and squirm trying to work out whether she was amoung friends i think any criticism of her is unfair she is in survival mode which in kings landing for her means being meek and staying out of trouble the queen of thorns was brilliant look forward to seeing more of her i agree with what someone else said  in the books this was the scene that revealed the nous and ambition of the tyrells which in the series has already kinda happened but it was great regardless the scene with margaery and joffrey was fantastic they were like two lions circling each other trying to work one another out joffrey was openly disdainful of sansa but i think is secretly impressed by margaery which i think cersei knows hence her earlier line of questioning what do you think of her and wants to impress her which he does in the only way he knows how she is keeping him sweet there was an interesting moment where they were sitting and he was playing with his crossbow phallic symbol much and it looked like margaery was going to reach for his hand but went for the crossbow instead because that was what would excite him more the briennejamie double act is delightful i only hope it will continue despite their apparant capture regarding the lack of mummers the reeds showed up a season late so just because the mummers werent in this episode doesnt mean they wont turn up somewhere i still think robbs story is the weakest thread thats a great shame because the war between the starks and lannisters is what kicked the whole thing off and should be central to events i can see why though after book 1 robb was never a pov character and events were told through catelyns eyes or news that reached kings landing that would never work on tv so things have been moved around and bits added to explain whats going on it feels a bit all over the place i hope it pulls together as the series progresses because his storyline is so important his character should be really interesting hes the boy king who becomes a noble warrior to avenge his father and right wrongs contrast to measly weasly horrid joffrey but his position is seriously weakened by his naivety marrying for love and his mothers indiscretions can he hold his wobbly alliances together the introduction of the reeds was well handled i thought although i was surprised that a fully grown man appears to have replaced the character of bran jojen was suitably unsettling and meera cheerful but deadly im happy with the theon bit as others have pointed out he doesnt reappear in the books until 4 or 5 but the narrative in the books isnt linear so there is no problem bringing him back now i always felt really sorry for theon he gets sent off as a child then finally returns home all ready to impress old pa with his cunning and gets totally shot down after that its just a series of poor decisions to win back daddys approval theres a great bit in series 2 when maester lewin says something like theon if you do this you are lost he does and he is and he knows it again its why the characters in got are so compelling hes a lost boy and you are rooting for him but hes also a vain arrogant childkiller my main gripe of this episode apart from another annoying shae scene was that ygritte missed a perfect opportunity to tell jon snow that he knows nothing dont even know what a worg is cmon "

"276" "DiamondDag" 2013-04-08 " sarahhughes  some of it was perhaps a bit clumsy because of the talk about wargs and threeeyed crows but crucially they seem to have got another couple of quality actors in key roles "

"278" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-08 " bellatrixlestrange  i found episode one far more bitty than this episode generally i always think there are a couple of little scenes they could hold over to the next episode because they feel a bit perfunctory and oh we ought to see how jons doing for example but with this episode i felt almost every scene counted and propelled the plot forward i could have done without tyrion and shae though "
"279" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-08 " diamonddag  exactly thats what i liked his confidence that was perfect i notice some people really didnt buy the scene with the reeds but i found it pretty well done and thought they got the casting just right "

"282" "Elspeth25" 2013-04-08 " really enjoyed this episode loads of good scenes but the one with sansa margery and the queen of thorns really stood out i actually got a bit teared up watching sansa as she described her fathers death normally shes easily the most annoying stark then the reactions of margery a shrug a little smile  she knew all along joffrey was a twunt and qot accepts it and carries on planning also i want a lemon cake oh and kudos for a cool entrance by the reeds you must be summer "
"283" "DiamondDag" 2013-04-08 " ahhh too much to mull over good episode lots of interesting scenes main point i thought thomas brodiesangster was quite simply perfect both disquieting compelling and something im glad they got right from the book confident he seemed sure of himself ellie kendrick was good too theyve got the reeds spot on but jojen stood out the line about jojens dad howland crying when he told him about neds death that got me also puberty i wonder if theyre going to address the passage of time or just hope no one notices that bran is growing a foot taller ever season "
"284" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-08 " jmsflms  in all honesty thats not a fair complaint season 2 has been out on dvd for a while and it aired last year im very tight about people spoiling on season 3 and im going to comment in a minute on the way people are walking a fine line on that but its completely unreasonable to complain about stuff thats actually happened in season 2 i understand that the picture was on the front page so you couldnt avoid it but theyre going to use pictures from this season because its a blog about this season and its pretty hard to avoid those pictures i dont want to sound as though im having a go at you but there are spoilers and spoilers "

"286" "Bellatrixlestrange" 2013-04-08 " theons plotline in series 2 made me wince a lot and this episodes scenes dear oh dear warning fingore btw guys i think some of the comments about theon are getting a bit spoilery please be carefulthis episode had an awful lot of characters even without daenerys bit much all at once some great scenes loved diana rigg also loved joffreys scenes interesting comment about him making sodomy a capital offence i read it as a veiled threat against loras presumably joff would know the rumours about him and renly and metatextually an extra reason for a modern audience to hate him overall i found the episode a bit indigestible too many ingredients but a lot of tasty morsels looking forward to seeing what happens with jaime and brienne and arya and the hound "

"302" "MRONeill" 2013-04-08 " chinofjim  ha i definitely see what youre saying  i guess i did hope more based on the books that it would be as interesting in the series  but i also see the challenge they had in introducing it i agree that the relationship bt bran and the reeds needs to be flushed out a lot more because of the diversion from the book on this entire story line i wonder if they made things more complicated for themselves vs introducing the reeds when they arrived in the books we are also forgetting to mention rickonno spoilers here  i hopehes largely left out of the books thus far and he and brans roads split again in the books and i feel like the writers are now wondering what the hell they do with the young wild child apparently they decided that hed run off into the distance with direwolves for nannies "
"303" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-04-08 " i find it a jolt when these episodes just end but i guess it doesnt bother me that much because ive read the books so anticipating what may happen next is not so nervewracking there are also significant cuts in the narrative inevitably when i watched series 2 i had to catch up with series 1 and i also read all the books at first just trying to follow all the blog character discussion simply bewildered me as there are so many characters in the story now i find that having read the books my understanding of what is going on in the tv series is enhanced and its not a problem that the books and the film have variations but maybe thats just me is it different for those sticking with the series that have not as yet read beyond the tv series should really be able to stand alone but its great to see characters that you have formerly just imagined for example roose boltons bastard is rather different from what i had imagined "
"304" "Greenseer" 2013-04-08 " sarahhughes  and ryan brighton i agree with both your posts about theon i have not yet seen tonights episode but am a book reader and find myself constantly on the shelf about theon i can see both sides here thats whats so wonderful about the series and the books you can have twinges of sympathy for the rotters and sometimes you want to give the heroes a slap roll on 9pm "
"305" "Ryan Brighton" 2013-04-08 " sarahhughes  i could maybe accept the young and stupid thing but he crossed the moral event horizon when he murdered those two children to hide the fact that he hadnt killed bran and rickonmaybe if he was ever a nice character you could feel more sorry for him but hes been an arrogant smug oaf the entire series i think hes just one of those fictional characters ive taken an instant dislike to alfie allen plays a smug git way too well "
"306" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-04-08 " chinofjim  it is clearly known around the kings landing court that renly was gay but is it similarly known that loras was his lover true that may be less apparent at kings landing than it was at renlys court but there were references by joffrey to his disdain for flowers on his outfit in connection with loras  which i took to mean he did know certainly margaery knows as she was encouraging loras to get renly ready for her in series 1 is that not so if it were not that jaime is also in the kingsguard then i would have thought the celibacy vow entailed by loras joining the same outfit would be an indication too id like to think its only sansa that fails to realise hes a lost cause  there is a lot of celibacy involved in got  what with crows taking the black the kingsguard the various eunuchs the unsullied etc "

"318" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-04-08 " muppetn2  the same with tyrion and shaei started to yawn in that scene it added nothing and i did not recall a jealousy angle from shae about sansa from the books the ros character is an addition in the tv series but tyrions past sex with her twice seemed to be added in to exacerbate shaes jealousy wondering what is being set up here "

"321" "keepithuman" 2013-04-08 " ryan brighton  so according to you it was tywins wifes death having tyrion that killed the best part of him and blinded him to tyrions worth maybe but like i said i dont buy it however if his wife committed adultery with one of the targaryens and tyrion was the result of that and tywin knew of this then it all fits just a theory of course but all such fun dont you think "

"328" "MRONeill" 2013-04-08 " chinofjim  i think jojen in the books was only a seer  not a warg wasnt sure how i felt by him being one in the series  although probably necessary to make sense of the reedbran relationship slightly odd introduction to the concept of a warg true but like with this entire series the producers have to introduce these concepts when they make the most senseand apparently they determined that by introducing the warg beyond the wall and branjojen in the same episode that it was best done in one fell swoop that said theyve been hinting at brans abilities since season 1 so it doesnt come completely out of left field "

"340" "MRONeill" 2013-04-08 " the highlights of this episode for me was thoros of myr and the bit of talent we saw from anguy friend of foe  or something in between how very got of them  it was exciting to see the reappearance of the hound and itll be interesting to see how it plays out with thoros and arya equally wonderful was the fight between jaime and brienne in a series filled with pairs aryahound  sansamargery  littlefingervarys  these two are my favorite jaimes banter with brienne shows that yes hes slightly a scoundrel but more than that he just wants some conversation brienne is fantastic at her frustration and her myopic focus on her goal also how tall is she in real life because she appeared several inches taller than jaime and that actor is not short i thought the sansalady olennamargery scene was beautifully done  i appreciate the juxtaposition of the obvious warmth and wealth of kings landing vs pretty much everywhere else in westeros lady olenna did not disappoint and i loved that they almost stuck with the conversation verbatim from the book sansa did wonderfully in that scene  you could see everything she wanted to tell them and instead kept it simple hes a monster wonderfully margery took this advice to heart  i loved seeing her play him like a crossbow  she knows hes a monster so she appeals to death and dangerand only goes so far as to make sure that he thinks all opinions and decisions are his own could you kill something i dont know your grace do you think i could absolutely enjoying this more fleshed out character than the margery in the books a last note regarding some thoughts from last week re beyond the wall  it feeling disjointed etc i like this portrayal of beyond wall  everyone in westeros ignores the myths from beyond the wall they dont take it seriously as it pertains to their lives however we know that the terrors beyond the wall represent the true horror that will face westeros the semidisjointed nature of the scenes to me reflect the lack of respect westerosi feel about beyond the wall  they dont consider it important to their continued existenceeven though nothing could be further from the truth "

"344" "ChinofJim" 2013-04-08 " mirthin  i would definately agree with you about the introduciton of the reeds but also about the notion of warging which just felt a bit hamfisted to me i honestly cant remember how it was done in the books but this was a bit lame i thought since almost the start of season 1 we have had all the foreshadowing on brans abilities being shown in the dreams and the discussions with osha and measter luwin i thought it was being done really well given how hard it must be to convey something so internal on a tv show and then that is all paid off with look here is a wilding warg look here is jojen hey bran you are totally a warg and also hey bran im a warg also so in the space of about 3 minutes we have not just the concept of warging introduced but also 3 warg capable characters is jojen a warg or is he just a seer i cant recall that just seemed lousy after they were doing such a grand job of showing the mystery around bran "
"345" "ChinofJim" 2013-04-08 " mirthin  you think it was poorly handled i cant remember in too much detail the crasters keep episode in the book but watching it play out on screen made me slighly uncomfortable particularly the scene between sam and jon i remember thinking jon is cool with this this surely will be addressed and then it was in the scene with mance and to me it worked becuase jons reasoning was convinving to me as he was troubled by something that was already troubling me now i dont want to get into too much of a book discussion but will just say that reason jon gives in the book doesnt even make much sense as it is the nights watch jon is leaving which is full of bastards and the like rather than winterfell mance is a man who values freedom above everything else why would a boy whining about not being allowed to sit at the top table hold sway with him a boy not being allowed to stop a terrible thing happening seems better to me "
"346" "Mrsbluesky" 2013-04-08 " muppetn2  that would be nikolaj costerwaldau  as with the books im enjoying the kings landinglannister storylines far more than the starks or dany i loved all the jaimebrienne scenes especially jaimes jibe about the throne being made of cocks that would have made the series poster of the brooding sean bean on the throne much more hilarious although the part with the old man who ended up betraying them was a bit too predictable a bit of a cliché and a glaringly obvious plotpoint also margaery is amazing shes older wiser and braver than poor sansa and she knows how to play the game i really dont think allowing the psychotic boy king a dangerous crossbow is a good idea although following chekhovs gun law if someone isnt shot with it by seasons end i shall feel obscurely cheated oh sweet summer child i am so looking forward to the rest of this series "
"347" "jennifera30" 2013-04-08 " really enjoyed that episode mainly for jaime and brienne who i just liked together from the get go but also for margaery she is brilliantly bonkers not entirely sure she has much to fear from joffrey though if anything i fear more for him she will eat him alive i can agree that the pace is fairly slow but it really has to be and im always impressed with the amount of new characters arriving without overwhelming the established cast i just wish i had the willpower to wait and watch it all over the space of a few days as i have done with other shows just cant restrain myself though "

"349" "Mirthin" 2013-04-08 " chinofjim  checkmate the scene between cersei and robert in season 1 is one of my favourite scenes of the whole series and yeah arya and tywin scenes were inspired you play cyvasse better than i ser however you will not win me over with your defense of jon and mance the scene and your justification of it hinges on the events at crasters keep which was another poorly handled embellishment "
"350" "ChinofJim" 2013-04-08 " muppetn2  it can be frustrating but i would never call it lifeless or outmoded like 14juillet does a show that leaves you wanting more is great imo no matter that we feel we live in an instant gratification world where we deserve to have everything now maybe 14juillet was referring to the netflix house of cards deal or maybe is more used to watching soaps 2 or 3 times a week i dont know but with got having it dealt out over the 10 week season run means hbo gets to keep the series in the limelight and means people are talking about it as they are here and in numerous other blogs for an extended period of time this is all good for profile and dvdbluray sales etc which is important if we we want the show to make money and continue to be produced i loved this episode and last weeks but i can dig the critism that they maybe move a little slowly and are concerned with putting the pieces on the board more than moving them significantly but i would say that was also the case with the first 3 or 4 episodes from last season and even season 1 as well the narrative in both the previous seasons picked up momentum as they went along "
"351" "Muppet_N2" 2013-04-08 " 14juillet  i agree game of thrones works giving you anxiety on whats to come but never actually delivering substantial endings to story arcs thats also how the books works martin constantly uses cliff hangers every chapter ends with a character in a limit situation and in the next chapter he moves to another one the characters are brilliant so it keeps you hooked to the story but it can be a little frustrating "
"352" "ChinofJim" 2013-04-08 " mirthin  when the show gets creative with the characters its never an improvement i very much disagree sometimes it doesnt really gel like as you say the introduction of the reeds but other times we get some brilliant tv for instancethe 1to1 between cersai and robert in season 1 the scenes betwen arya and tywin in season 2 the scene with catelyn torturing herself over jon snow pretty much every thing with margaery i also disagree with your view about jons rationale for ditching the nights watch what he saw his lord letting an atrocity go unchecked becuase it suited his needs is the sort of thing you can see really rankle with jon it is belilevable and him giving that as a reason makes perfect sense in the context of the adaptation in particular the pain and dislocation it caused with sam when jon wasnt able to offer any help with regards to gilly and her unborn child the adapation is just following these threads through thinking about it if anything it is the reason jon gave in the books that seems unconvincing it is maybe easier to get away with that sort of thing in literary form and it did give jon a good line but in the tv show i expect that would have just come across as whiny and whingy and utterly unconvincing "
"353" "14Juillet" 2013-04-08 " being new to the party perhaps i spoiled things a bit for myself for watching the first two series on cd over the course of about two weeks to get caught upi am finding the one hour a week format to be annoying enough to consider putting off watching until the series is complete 8 more weeks and then watching the whole thing over the course of a week or soi find the pace to be maddeningly slow with the imposition of the one episode a week artificeto me each episode plays like an extended trailer for the next and so on and drains the programme of any dramatic momentumthe more interesting it gets the more artificial and annoying it seemsif you havent watched the previous series in the more natural continuous formats of disk or download i suggest you do so the whole storey comes alive and is much more exciting and fun than it can ever be with this what seems to be hopelessly outmoded and comparatively lifeless weekly format "
"354" "ChinofJim" 2013-04-08 " timestamp  well to be fair jaime who was a halve starved prisoner recovering from spending months in shackles was trying to fight with both both hands bound together and brienne is portrayed as not really having much grace although she does know what she is doing and has the wits to learn as she is going given those circumstances you cant really expect a nimble diplay of swordmanship and stylised choreograhy i appreciate that the scene was portrayed fairly realistically and in correct context "
"355" "dandydon" 2013-04-08 " ye know the torture scene well anyone smugly mentioning the books and subtly dropping in references to forthcoming episodeswe bullied you book reading people at school and well get you again unless you button it "
"356" "Rachael Fraser" 2013-04-08 " candylilacs  i think the reeds were wearing green just very subtley for example jojens cloak was green httpwwwfanpopcomclubsgameofthronesimages32937916titlemeerajojenreedfanart "
"357" "Mirthin" 2013-04-08 " muppetn2  i thought it was a very good episode but i will agree that the scenes between bran and jojen were stilted and robbs development is somewhat lacking with this show the best scenes are almost always lifted straight from the novels recent examples the queen of thorns meeting sansa and tyrions confrontation with tywin when the show gets creative with the characters its never an improvement the introduction of the reeds was an example the producers need to have more faith in the text other instances jon snows rationale for joining the wildlings in the show isnt half as interesting or believable as his rationale in the book and there was no good justification for the change when robb and catelyn found out that theon killed bran and rickon in book 2 it was a major turning point in their character archs it was catelyns greif that inspired her to release jaime robb fell in love with jane westerling talisa in the show why again while she consoled him "

"360" "Mirthin" 2013-04-08 " candylilacs  the crannogmen are masters of camouflage which would include earthy green but also greys and browns they live in swamps unfortunate associations with peter pan were wisely avoided "
"361" "Muppet_N2" 2013-04-08 " candylilacs  i really enjoyed brienne and jaimes tussle i especially liked how she got serious at the end and jaime was pushed to the ground when the group of knights showed up it showed that brienne was largely playing with jaime what that means in the bigger picture i do not knowbut interesting i agree they were fighting but they were also interacting in a gamedance that both of them understand the face of jaime dont know the actors name when he got the sword in his hands was brilliant you could see the pleasure he was complete and notoriously enjoying the fight "
"362" "grayfox" 2013-04-08 " timestamp  correct its a disgrace tv shows should either be freetoair with commericals or advertfree with subscription at the very least adverts on subscription channels should be limited to inbetween programmes and never repeatedly in the middle of them people are such mugs to pay for the privilege of watching adverts its why i dont mind waiting a year to get the series on bluray and watch as intended that said i think you can download shows on sky and watch advert free "
"363" "Muppet_N2" 2013-04-08 " i think it was a rather dull episode only fitting for those that are already bought by the characters i love this series and dialogs and all that but this time there were not universally good lines like the one between tyrion and tywin in the first episode and instead we get some totally unnecesary conversations the line between bran and reed seemed a sketch i do you have greensight  yes i do and you  yes i dreamt a crow yeah i know ok the same with tyrion and shae they also keep losing chances to actually develop the robb stark character in the series he is totally boring and uncharismatic not in the ned stark way that is not in purpose while in the books you get to understand he is a genious tactitian in the series its impossible to understand why he is king in the north as a key character in this season thats an important failure "
"364" "timestamp" 2013-04-08 " i just had to pop back on this thread after reading on another article that sky atlantic shows commercials during game of thrones can this possibly be true i know that tv here in the states is known for showing a bunch of commercials but our premium pay channels such as hbo showtime and starz etc dont ever show commercials i cant even imagine trying to watch a show such as game of thrones with commercial breaks quite unnaturally thrown in if this is true then forget phone hacking now i have a really good reason to despise rupert murdoch and im slightly annoyed at hbo for letting sky get away with such a thing "

"367" "avdotya" 2013-04-08 " god ive missed jaime on renly its a shame the throne wasnt made of cocks you wouldnt have been able to get him off it lady tyrell was also quality liked her very unsentimental summation of loras qualities and her insistence on not waiting for the cheese course woman after my own heart thoros was cool but hell be decidedly less cool if he considers handing over arya to any of the powers that be now i think theon is a nasty little satyr and general numpty but im not sure id wish this future even on him iwan rheon does eerie extremely well wonder whether theyre going to deviated from ramsays character in the books "
"368" "Sinequanone" 2013-04-08 " all the cameos were really good ie introduction of new characters played by familiar actors was a bit worried at the familiar face of paul kaye but thought he was good too good to see arya  hoping her strand is going to do her character and acting justice not being a book reader i found the introduction of the reeds a bit confusing and a bit shoehorned in but enjoying the worgwarg stuff really liking brans hairstyle theon scenes also am unsure what is going i am aware of the bastard of bolton but what with the burning of winterfell last series i feel this strand is the weakest of them all margaerys scene with joffreys weapon was great and maybe best bit of this episode though when she blamed her father for pushing her into marrying joffrey i thought she said before she wanted to be queen or was that just something to let sansa think she is not a schemer "

"372" "swampie" 2013-04-08 " well done episode though the character bloat is starting to show with every character trying to get some screentime lady catelyns confession was quite moving and goes to show what skill martin has for characters struggling with difficult choices the scene of margaery toying with jofferey and his crossbow was great as well shes as manipulative as tyrion and littlefinger who appear to take a backseat this season "
"373" "Davidio79" 2013-04-08 " i enjoyed the episode particularly the scene with the queen of thorns as shes one of my favourite characters from this book and diana rigg stormed it butwhere is the greatest character of them alllord varys "
"374" "guardiansek" 2013-04-08 " i thought this was a very good episode i personally am not a huge fan of jamies constant taunting of brienne though or jamies forced fey personality the only time i thought we were getting somewhere was when jamie told brienne that you cant choose who you love as someone who is attached to the ultimate ice queen in kings landing he should know "

"379" "ntofr1" 2013-04-08 " timestamp  i know what you mean but i think i had to let both facts that jaime was in irons and brienne didnt want to kill him be enough reason for it not being a fight to end all fights it had to stay within certain limits "
"380" "timestamp" 2013-04-08 " ntofr1 08 april 2013 554am briennes face throughout that scene was all kinds of right thats certainly true in fact the actual acting by both of them was really good and the dialogue which threatened to get out of hand for a fight scene managed to be just right but when there is a fight scene i am a sucker for a wellchoreographed fight scene and i just felt that the swordplay left a little to be desired "
"381" "ntofr1" 2013-04-08 " timestamp  briennes face throughout that scene was all kinds of right "
"382" "ntofr1" 2013-04-08 " ntofr1  oh and jack gleeson hes kinda making me feel sympathy for jof i did not expect that its weird the beginning of the scene with him and cerce almost had traces of a strange sexual nature almost or was it full on margaery has been super well cast with natalie dormer and i reckon diana rigg would have maggie smith any day "
"383" "ntofr1" 2013-04-08 " frangipani0  awesome scene great to see sansa let go of some of the courtly attitude shes learnt to put on "
"384" "ntofr1" 2013-04-08 " its a shame not to have the mummers but i dont think i can really complain this was an awesome episode as soon as robb and cat came on i started to cry but then im a bit drunk this was a stark heavy episode which just felt good despite the changes to the books i think the whole breaking of the fellowship starks not hobbits that began in episode 2 season 1 is carrying a helluva lot of weight cats speech to oona about jon helped switch the focus back to past events to help remind that theres a lot of things to account for current events which could have become glossed overit was a sudden way to introduce jojen and meera but it fits the grand scheme nicely oh theon "

"388" "timestamp" 2013-04-08 " candylilacs 08 april 2013 338am i really enjoyed brienne and jaimes tussle really i felt let down by jaime and briennes fight but youve got margaery nailed she knows exactly how to play that little monster she wasnt even phased by his menacing accusations instead turning the truth into just enough of a lie to placate him brilliant i cant say i was bothered by the reeds attire heck im going to have to rewatch it just to confirm they werent wearing green maybe my mindseye dressed them in green for me an another note i thought that sophie turners performance as sansa was a high point this episode especially when she was speaking with lady olena about her former fiance and one tiny note i really liked the look arya gave thoros when he said just one more thing or something to that effect it was a brief oh you motherfraker kinda moment "
"389" "candylilacs" 2013-04-08 " margaery was being what she needed to be a beautiful cipher what you like joffrey i like because im a woman and women do what they are told i have no desires except to please you and be used as a an object how can joffrey not love that margaery knows what he wants  no challenges just ego massaging because thats what monsters like shes just doing what she needs to i really enjoyed brienne and jaimes tussle i especially liked how she got serious at the end and jaime was pushed to the ground when the group of knights showed up it showed that brienne was largely playing with jaime what that means in the bigger picture i do not knowbut interesting although it did not have daenarys i did enjoy the kings landing scene and briennejaime also i was disappointed the reeds werent wearing green which was supposed to be part of their culture the gray is so dreary and doesnt differentiate them at all from the rest of the boring gray folk also loved the appearance of the hound and look forward to more "
"390" "frangipani0" 2013-04-08 " god love poor sansa for telling the truth about joffrey but im sure shell be sick with worry since she blabbed diana rigg is a hoot she is perfect as the queen of thorns shes who id want to sit by and eat cheese with at every feast "
