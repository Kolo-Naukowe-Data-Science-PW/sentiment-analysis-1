"1" "edinamikie" 2012-05-07 " its probably down to the fact that ive read all the books which i hadnt done when i watched series 1 so dramatically its not as exciting i also think theres too many characters in series two so we get lots of shorter scenes when i want a bit more i have no idea how theyll film the next book because theres even more characters in that "
"2" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-06 " just discovered these httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvcnbbzmmwd00featurerelmfu "
"3" "5432Hun" 2012-05-05 " it seems im the only one who finds season two nowhere near as good as season 1 its down to personal opinions of course but viewing figures suggest you are in a minority us first airing viewing figures for the last episode were the highest yet and this series figures have been 5075 up on series 1 to be fair i do think that the story in the second seriesbook is less coherent than seriesbook 1 the main characters have dispersed and there is no more ned who is the most recongnisably heroic character in bookseries 1 and provides a strong narratve at the heart of the story this is of course why the ned payoff is so shockingsatisfying "
"4" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-04 " i found season one to have me hooked immediately and then i found it dragged a bit in the middle but that might have been my fault for trying to watch all 10 episodes in one sitting as far as jon snows mother is concerned i have only watched the tv series so i dont think anything i say can be a spoiler but just in case i will say possibly spoiler theory for it to be important his mother perhaps has to be another noble woman perhaps to some extent that makes him heir to a southern housecrown and perhaps even the northern and southern kingdoms "
"5" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-04 " it seems im the only one who finds season two nowhere near as good as season 1 youre right you may well be on your own i think series 2 is outstanding what are the far better aspects from season 1 "
"6" "badger1969" 2012-05-04 " if you made your assumption while reading the first book id say youre probably on the right track many of the more significant clues are in the first book i myself guessed the identity in the very first episode of the tv show spoilerish talk about question of jon snows mum i must admit i didnt really give it much of a thought the first time i watched the tv series then i read the first book  i was a fair way through it before the obvious answer hit me then i wanted to go back  reread the first part of the book to see if my theory made sense havent really done that yet but watching s1 again probably backed up my theory its funny in a way it was a spoiler to have it confirmed in a guardian article that grrm considered the question to be a crucial part of his story otherwise i might have just assumed id been thinking about the answer to a question that didnt really matter this makes me even more certain that i must be right end spoiler "

"15" "badger1969" 2012-05-04 " it may just be me being picky  given my heavy involvement in all the cryptic talk  but i was tempted to report your previous one line post ive avoided replying to that one directly so as not to draw attention back to it no idea how all that stuff will be depicted on tv but if its done in a certain way ill leave it to you to decide if it might be wise to censure yourself presumably selfreporting is possible hope most of our talk is cryptic enough not to piss off nonbook readers  rather than all of them having run for the hills long ago "

"28" "5432Hun" 2012-05-03 " i agree that it could be impossibly clumsy to have these two characters disappear as they do in the books so either the series covers both journeys which seems unlikely to me as theres already so much story to get through or they are collapsed into one and the characters mixed around a bit the more i think about it the more i think the second option is the most likely it fits both the absence so far of the two related characters who should have showed up by now and what we have heard about grrm wanting to increase screen time for a couple of others this leaves the question of secret which the two related characters other relation is believed to share personally i think this secret is a bit of a macguffin anyway we dont even know if grrm intends to reveal this but in any case i think they could give this to another character if they want to reek isnt cast so presumably wont be showing up this series it could be that they will hold back the events he is part of until series 3 or another character who has turned up could take over those events this series and reek could turn up next if at all jon snows mother is                  "

"30" "PeachMcGee" 2012-05-03 " oh seven hells you go to work for a day and miss some of the most cryptic chat ever chatted it will be really interesting to see how the producers handle the parallel narratives of different characters when some of these narratives have yet to be published in the novels  the disappearance of two quite major characters for a large amount of time is fine in a literary context but on television it might not work so well so do we get to watch the story of one sort of principal before its been fully recounted in the books or does grrm need to get his notinsiginificant arse into gear and publish a few more novels i think it will all become clear in the next couple of episodes seriously interesting questions for any media studieseng lit scholars out there the original medium being heavily influenced by a secondary medium however it pans out i cant wait on the subject of those characters we have yet to meet i will be most disappointed if theres no sign of reek on the subject of mysteries i am currently rereading the novels to see if i can work out who john snows mother is i genuinely dont want even a hint until i have finished my quest and fully collated all findings there may be a flow chart or a carrieoffhomelandesque timeline "

"72" "UncertainAgain" 2012-05-02 " yeah one of the lannister guards was carrying it when arya was going over her list of names an old woman called to him by name for some food or water and he came over and smacked her and arya added him to the list polliver she was staring at needle again when tywin came riding up and put a halt to the ticklers festivities polliver told her to kneel before lord tywin or hed kill her with needle and tywin observed that she was only a girl disguised as a boy tywin rescued arya from polliver and took her as cupbearer i dont think we saw him last episode "

"80" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-02 " i know what people mean about the the magic but i think generally in fantasy no one knows how to handle it when melisandre gace birth to it in the preceding episode i was a bit unsure about it but the bit with the shadow stannis assasination was a highlight of the series dramatic action of the highest order the series keeps these magic events as highlights so far these highlights have included the first glimpse of white walkers in series 1 ep 1  something that had you hooked immediately and then the appearance of the dragons at the end of series 1 thinking some more why this was the best episode so far the renly assassination was great the brienne and catelyn pledges arya and tywin but the main thing was the location shoot of beyond the wall which was breathtaking "
"81" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-02 " kged2 may 2012 1233ami should have mentioned this one too  the kids who play arya sansa and bran do their own versionhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvreasbbijm00fucking adorable its actually from the audio commentary they do together for an episode in series 1    "

"83" "UninventiveName" 2012-05-02 " for this episode i think the more that it gets all magical the less believable it isim all for dragons dire wolfs and whitewalkers but ghost man really where will it end then what beats smoke it was all too reminiscent of the moment in lost when the black smoke appears and it just gets a bit ott hope they reign it in a bit or im going to start expecting wizards in white and talking trees the magic doesnt bother me so far in the series as i dont feel any of it has been used as a real deus ex machina plot device just slightly more entertaining analogues for real events for example the whole shadow baby thing is basically just an assassin  it hasnt performed a role that a highlytrained hired sword couldnt have done although a mecenary would obviously be more fallible it also accentuates the interesting ambiguity around the extent of melisandres powers and her motivations more so than her convincing stannis to hire an assassin would do similarly the dragons as has already been mentioned in other blogs are basically just weapons of mass destruction the dire wolves dont do anything more than act as massive guard dogs and the white walkers arent really involved much yet but dont seem to represent anything more than a powerful opposition that cant be reasoned with to give the show an outside threat separate from the political wheedlings of the ruling houses the shark is far from jumped yet at least as far as im concerned "

"88" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-02 "  surely brans dream means that theon and the iron islanders are coming for winterfell what with them coming from the water and serving the drowned god i got the feeling that brans watery vision presaged some kind of tsunami event it was pointed out that winterfell was miles from the sea so a flood by seawater would only seem possible in that way "
"89" "monders" 2012-05-02 " briennes i wont leave him was fucking dreadful however on the whole i think its a great bit of casting im getting a mildly autistic vibe from her which in my opinion really works "
"90" "5432Hun" 2012-05-02 " there are two significant characters missing from the show who should have turned up by now already mentioned in this thread i think brans dream was actually one of theses    i believe that the producers said that some characters will be pushed back slightly and introduced in season3    and they may be the only link to the secret ned promised his sister on her death bed as their father was the only other person present and still living    im struggling with myself here i really want to chip in on the discussion on these two missing characters but its hard to do without spoilers first up i hope youre right and they show up in series 3 im holding out on the hope that because so many new significanrt characters are introduced in book 2 but fewer in book 3 as the story has settled down a bit the producers have decided to introduce a least one of these two in s3 second theres apparently an online petition strated to save these two characters google it im sure youll find it if interested third trying to figure out how the story will work if they dont appear this gets very tricky without spoilering but soome possibilities a someone who dies in the godswood doesnt die but instead accompanies someone on a journey which hsnt been recounted in any detail in the books yet thus leaving the person who in the books goes on that journey free to go on the journey which has been recounted in the books b everyone who goes on these two journeys goes on a single journey together instead "
"91" "5432Hun" 2012-05-02 " im afraid its one in all in if you can stomach wights smoke monsters really arent that much of a stretch the believability is all in the reactions to renlys assissination  which were all exceptionally well acted including for a change this season littlefinger not sure about this so far theyve done a good job of selling goft as a story about power set in a world where magic occassionally happens but theres obviously a limit to the tolerence level of the average punter if the whole plot becomes driven by magic or everyone spends each episode pointing in wonder at some legendary temple that has risen magically from legend then my guess is theyll lose the mainstream audience and be left with fantasy fanboys theres also something about the sort of magic which is used blue eyed little girl wights like in the prologue to series 1 are kind of cool and ghostly little girls ar a horror staple which most people will be ok with tom bombadil is only considered cool by the sort of weirdos who give their marriage vows in elvish most of the audience will run a mile from this sort of hokeyness "

"93" "5onthe5" 2012-05-02 " i do have a bit of a problem with magic in general it isnt very dramatic authors put in just enough magic to make the plot exciting but not so much that it creates a plot hole for example in harry potter there is magic powerful enough to kill people or to turn people into animals which is all good and exciting but if there was a magic spell that could duplicate physical objects or create an earthquake that would have totally shortcircuited the plot in got i was hoping it might be a world where there were animals or phenomena that are mystical or supernatural to us  wights dragons  but were really more like biological anomalies than actual magic the smoke baby seems like a bit of a game changer "

"233" "CoombsBucket" 2012-05-01 " i dont agree with you that renly and loras are token gays especially since as far as i could tell there wasnt any of hedonism you described coming from them perhaps youre mistaking them for tyrion or perhaps littlefinger compared to the other romantic relationships that have been on screen our token gays have actually seemed the most normal and loving in places something that hbo has to be commended for to be honest i think youre trolling if you havent read the books i recommend them they dont really go into the whole magic thing until a good way through the second book and even then its given a light touch grrm is much more interested in the relationships between his characters and that really shows it seems to me youre focusing too much on one very small facet of the story and ignoring what youre actually intended to be interested in the plotting backstabbing and generally nasty nobles of westeros "
"234" "miapatrick" 2012-05-01 " doesnt entirely how old was he peoples accents can regress to very early in their childhood my boyfriend grew up in manchester and rarely saw his macclesfield father growing up but as he gets older the mac has almost completely overcome the manc maybe thats because he sees his father occasionally now maybe littlefinger is now in contact with someone from where he originally comes from maybe by turning on ned thus earning catlins hatred for all eternity has had some affect i admit it all might be a bit oversubtle but it is possible "
"235" "Woof73" 2012-05-01 " dear coombsbucket of francia i must correct your grammar  it is not a people but some people though i can see why you made your mistake she does not have many followers five by my count two dodgy horsethieves ser mormont and a pair of bitchy handmaidens this does not include her dragons all of whom are shorter than brienne of tarths cock stannis baratheon "

"320" "testure" 2012-04-30 " i felt this was another very gratifying episode followed in quick succession from episode four’s dark gem episode five perhaps conveys a sense of a drawing board reset after all the delivery we got last episode this is pretty much back to the intent of establishing the things to come as opposed to paying anything off in terms of dramatic impetus this is perhaps the last seemingly retrogressive step season two has to take pretty much everything seems set up now and it should be quite a gleeful domino fall for each character from here on in but before i come close to damning ep5 with faint functional praise i have to say i thought this bore oodles and oodles of adaptive goodness primarily impressive was the fist of the first men this is the brave bravura location filming that everything beyond the wall reads and feels like no directorial conceits in the mix just an untold vastness that really bodes well for everything in wildling territory to finally see qhorin halfhand was a relief the last major character introduction of the season as far as this season is concerned i would say so to a lesser extent of character import we have the nice decorative renderings of pyatt pree dagmer and yer one in the lacquer masque whose name i can never remember book to screen proximity was most evident with tyrion’s “interview with the pyromancer” perfect while the distance between the two was most pronounced in twyin’s interview with arya a complete invention but there was nothing better or more perfect in the episode as far as i’m concerned poor stannis his name is wrote larger than perhaps anyone else in the arc but will be given relatively little to do throughout having said that dillane and cunningham continue to be modestly magnificent in the little they’re given i’m actually liking the dany scenes in season 2 dragons opulence in qarth dothraki levity and a triffic emotional setto between jorah and his khaleesi fantastic everything else in the episode evinced lesser panache but the scenes were what i would call admirably practical brienne and catelyn littlefinger and margaery arya and jaqen bran and osha loved the minor detail before news of torrhen’s square came to bran the only slightly sucky aspect i got from this episode was the ‘dispatch’ in the opening which looked a tad overcooked in the realm of high fantasy and could have been perhaps a little more ambivalent to the eyes of cat and brienne ok we the audience know it’s an audacious looking menace being as we were front row for the nativity but it could have been just more a shadow to the unfortunate witnesses minor quibble great episode and it should all be delivery and payoff after this no "
"321" "GrayArea" 2012-04-30 " i cant believe they changed hodors dialogue they totally missed the point "
"322" "singist" 2012-04-30 " is no one going to mention the close up of gendrys torso at the end rewinds episode for 20th time to get another look "
"323" "SarahHughes" 2012-04-30 " singist and siccarpoint  i thought a lot about brienne actually because the scene is very awkward but i came down on the positive side because i think brienne is awkward and stumbling when not fighting and overly heartfelt and hard to watch so for now ive decided its quite a good performance i do of course reserve the right to entirely change my mind again next week "
"324" "SarahHughes" 2012-04-30 " thank you  actually im kicking myself having just had it pointed out on twitter that ed tudor pole was the ranting street preacher i really should have made him random brit of the week and given roy dotrice bigger billing in the main text "
"325" "glitterfairy11" 2012-04-30 " i didnt like to say im sure hes indecently younger than i am but since you brought it upwow he should always be topless for accuracy  it must be pretty warm at the forge right right  i loved it this week first episode this series that didnt make me think have i gone and spoilt it by reading all the books brienne was magnificent in her fight scene arya just gets better and better  i was thinking how brilliant tywin was and then she went and starred him out lots of pieces are falling into place now and i cant wait to see what happens next and siccarpoint im also eagerly awaiting the return of jaime "
"326" "singist" 2012-04-30 "  brienne is not coming across all that well for me very wooden the pledging scene took me right out of the moment things might improve when we get some chat going between her and cat though her fight scene was the most convincing weve had thus far though in either season not just a pretty face eh yeah have to agree with you about the woodenness i thought this when she first appeared 2 eps ago but thought it was just me being fussypants but alas no her acting makes me think of school plays and amateur dramatics that said the fighting was awesome "
"327" "natzandtheratz" 2012-04-30 " loved this weeks episode although was slightly underwhelmed by the demise of renly he was supposed to get his throat slitthe scenes in harrenhal were outstanding "

"334" "SiccarPoint" 2012-04-30 " this weeks random observations bad luck renly thanks for playing might this have fitted better at the end of last week though i thought the impact was dulled by the fact we came to it cold  the fist filming in iceland must have been expensive but isnt it pretty the lack of trees and overabundance of ice was a bit unexpected though at least theyll have plenty of warning if they get attacked httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvdpxg4pdpj4w  brienne is not coming across all that well for me very wooden the pledging scene took me right out of the moment things might improve when we get some chat going between her and cat though her fight scene was the most convincing weve had thus far though in either season not just a pretty face eh  loras didnt come across like a whiny biatch this week finally im starting to want the sardonic airs of jaime back pretty strongly though  rickon a boy who clearly has some issues good characterbuilding going on here i wonder if well get his character fleshed out a bit more fully at some point dany and jorah awwwwwkwaaaaaard definite airs of if i pretend hes not coming on to me maybe itll be like its not happening la la la from dany arent baby dragons cute also great gratuitous shots of ghost just hanging out and looking awesome in the long shots on the fist stannis do not mess with that guy seems to be one of the only contenders from the throne who actually has the necessary skill set to both be vaguely competent and also stay alive while ruling its clearly all about justice except when that interferes with the getting things done seems like a pretty sound if inconsistent way to play the game "

"339" "keepithuman" 2012-04-30 " although there are salty sex scenes in the book this series so far has been practically pornographic to its detriment in my opinion so it was a relief last night to be spared the graphic sex scenes and the episode was the best in this second season because of it "
"340" "CamTaylor" 2012-04-30 " couldnt wait for tonight manchester derby didnt help and watched this online this season is proving to be a much different beast it has been slow but i remember how much things accelerated after episode five last season casting proves to be spot on jaqhar brienne even pryat pree truly spoiled at the moment with new thrones mad men and even south park "
