"2" "MoreTears" 2011-05-05 " eddielarkin costerwaldau jaime lannister is danish "
"3" "EddieLarkin" 2011-05-05 " speaking of the kids  are they all british actors i dont dare look it up on imdb in case some spoilers leap out at me if so the directors are getting far better performances out of their child stars than any uk show does arya has been brilliant from the getgo and bran gave a lovely performance in the scene with old nan all of the major parts are played by british or irish actors minus tyrion and drogo the kids had no prior professional acting experience except for ad work for issac who plays bran its amazing how they found them considering how good they are "
"4" "elsmallo" 2011-05-05 " i forgot you are skinny this is good the target is smaller ive been waiting for someone to say this to me for like ever "
"5" "elsmallo" 2011-05-05 " i have to say i am enjoying this despite my skepticism during the first episode not read the books and its taken me a few viewings to grasp the connections between characters despite some who have read them complaining its a bit obvious it reminds me a bit of watching lotr with my dad whod never read it and every five minutes hed say i dont understand what the hell is going on well i am feeling this a little but then that never stopped me before the geography is a bit perplexing  how is that that cat stark does all that travelling in no time and then just pops off homeanyhow i think shes just about one of the best actors in it excepting of course peter dinklage who a few lines here and there apart is absolutely cracking he seemed a little too nice in this episode great though it was to discover he appears to be an absolute gent i think he needs to remain more ambiguous the consensus here is that aiden gillen is good  i cant agree not because he isnt a fine actor but because he seems to be wasted in this role hes having to pack so much information into each brief scene and it feels a bit forced to me at least compared to comparable parts in the wire etc but i suppose hell be developed in future episodes and i hope theyre paying him well likewise i think lena headley is awful just so flat and lacking in enthusiasm theres also an interesting mixture of regional accents involved and i wonder what the americans are making of it all obviously weve got sean bean gruffer than ever and older hes really starting to look his age and a few others from up north then the almost conneryesque iain glen the fluctuatingly enjoyable transatlantic of tyrion lannister the downright funky jaime from quite frankly it could be anywhere in europe they must have sent him to an international school then we have a good bit of maori and even some cheesy mediterranean for the dancingmaster wasnt this written by an american "
"6" "hellcat" 2011-05-04 " oh ew id forgotten about the blessing from the great stallion thing gaaah "
"7" "hellcat" 2011-05-04 " my favourite episode so far the slower pace has really paid off with nuanced thoughtful character pieces bloody good aiden gillen is terrific all surface charm and wheels turning hes creepiest at his most sincere his yearning looks at catelyn made me even more nervous than that small unmoving smile loved the first kill conversation so much loss and loathing beautifully done the whole sequence with bran was gorgeous nans ghost stories were properly terrifying and robb and bran were lovely together nikolaj costerwaldau continues to impress as jaime theres an elegance and irony to him that gives him a family resemblance to tyrion when he said burn them all bowed and left the room i was strongly reminded of dinklages tyrionwhich of course is all to the good "
"8" "DiamondDag" 2011-05-04 " yes fair point sorry although i dont really comment on guardian things at all and i cant see a way for me to delete it if a mod wanted to get rid of it i wouldnt mind "
"9" "SimonEssex" 2011-05-04 " diamonddaginteresting points mate and i agree with your points from a feast for crows but despite your spoiler warning at the top it might be worth taking your post down i think that you reveal something that many would consider a major spoiler and this blog is trying to stay spoilerfree for people who have not read the books warnings or no "
"10" "amypoodle" 2011-05-04 " i cant imagine the show will be anything other than a success its already popular and it hasnt even had the time to seep into the mass consciousness yet "

"12" "DrSmurfsGhost" 2011-05-04 " roll on next week and the hands tourney i say so hes still going to get one despite the appauling debt of the treasurythat surely cant be a good move fun to watch though "
"13" "Pricey10" 2011-05-04 " best episode so far as others have confirmed as a massive fan of the books did a game of thrones read through recently to prepare myself ive been absolutely delighted with the way the series has been handled by hbo i agree with numerous posters above who have mentioned that the added scenes have been thoroughly well though out the directors seem to really understand the characters personalities and the subtle interactions between them i found the conversation between robert jaime and barristan to be very powerful it did a great job of highlighting jaimes ambivalence towards his slaying of aerys and gave an unlikely parallel with roberts inability to lay his past to rest however i think my favourite scene had to be aryas training with syrio forel its pretty much a perfect imagining of the training scenes from the book and really fleshed out a character that up until now id had trouble imagining in my mind the work from both actors in this scene in particular the one playing arya gave me goosebumps i think this is the point that i really became comfortable with the idea that this show could pay suitable homage to the novels and become something truly magnificent roll on next week and the hands tourney i say "
"14" "DrQuinzel" 2011-05-04 " i definitely chose the right time to get sky this and doctor who are the only things on tv that are appointment viewing for me at the moment sean bean got even better in this episode after being upstaged by some of the supporting characters in the first two eps he fully took the lead in this episode and really feels like the heart of the show i particularly liked his interactions with his two very different daughters speaking of the kids  are they all british actors i dont dare look it up on imdb in case some spoilers leap out at me if so the directors are getting far better performances out of their child stars than any uk show does arya has been brilliant from the getgo and bran gave a lovely performance in the scene with old nan loved how she snapped out of her spooky voice as soon as robb came in  she wasnt taking the story quite as seriously as she was making out but i imagine the story will turn out to have quite a lot of truth in it so far im not warming to dany yet or cersei and jamie i know youre not supposed to like those two but were not supposed to like joffrey and viserys either and i cheer every time they come on screen nice to see aiden gillen back at his smarmy best even if his accent was wobbling all over the place but as many people have said above peter dinklage is walking away with this show "
"15" "JohnDear" 2011-05-04 " assuming it can taken that literally the symbolism would seem to indicate the two houses doing for each other the old dire wolf and the old stag killed other and only the pups survive signifcant not read the books but i reckon it might be "
"16" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-04 " i assumed the scene with the dire wolf and pups was really important and probably prophetic in some ways particularly the fact it was killed by a stag isnt the stag the symbol of roberts house assuming it can taken that literally the symbolism would seem to indicate the two houses doing for each other "
"17" "FrogFeet417" 2011-05-04 " vk1980  ha i also had pictured robert as being played by brian blessed for jaime lannister i thought that his smugness arrogance and sneakiness would have been well portrayed by paul bettany i have been really enjoying the show and i still am but this episode i started to really miss the details that the books can provide it is still good watching though and better than i would have initially hoped for "
"18" "JohnDear" 2011-05-04 " but what has happened to jon snows dire wolf ghost i assumed the scene with the dire wolf and pups was really important and probably prophetic in some ways particularly the fact it was killed by a stag "
"19" "Cottin" 2011-05-04 " great show so far but what has happened to jon snows dire wolf ghost in the books he is rather important as are all of the stark wolves "
"20" "Kulturtrager" 2011-05-04 " im shocked at all the embarrassment and squirmishness over the sexually themed scenes they are perfectly fine well actually im not entirely shocked brits in general are so funny in their relationship to sex anyhoo the excellent adaptation continues "
"21" "TinyFemaleWriter" 2011-05-04 " absolutely thrilling so far i havent read the books and this was a major discovery for some really reading i have decided to wait until the first series is over i know i wont be able to contain myself any longer than that i was a bit worried that sean bean would just do a boromir but hes been really good i thoroughly agree with the person above who said he was like a man carrying the whole world on his shoulders not a weak performance from anyone else either i am especially pleased with the juicy dialogue sometimes you find such stilted dialogue in this genre but grrm is giving his characters great lines and so far the quality of the downloads has been good why they dont invite you to watch it online the next day for 23 pounds per episode i do not understand i will not subscribe to a channel for one show but i would be happy to pay per view even if i had to watch all the ads there are ads arent there "
"22" "carltimms" 2011-05-03 " great to see how many people who havent read the books are really getting into this i am a little torn in that i am loving it as a massive fan of the books but part of me wishes i was enjoying this ride fr the first time the problem with having read the books is when things dont quite meet my expectation vaerys for example looked right but did not sound eunuch enough higher pitched voice a necessity imho interesting that nonreaders are already bandying theories around such as parentage and whats to become of certain characters i am just really pleased its had that effect and no i certainly wont be commenting either way of who is joffreys dad what will happen to dany or jon etc and i am sure all other readers of the books will agree with me much better to discover it fresh than ruined by some internet troll couple of thoughts  agree with others above about the new added scenes for me the stand outs in this weeks episode particularly loved the war stories scene and the mormontdothraki bloke scene also tyrion pissing off the edge of the world was something only tv could convey so well  arya is a close second to tyrion in terms of portrayal of the book character just perfect why oh why did they change dany ordering viserys to walk to just the dothraki ordering it  this is an important moment for her where she loses all fear of the dragon and the shift in power is completed really lost as to why they changed that where the blue blazes is ghost jons direwolf this is for me the biggest most annoying exclusion and one that makes no sense in the context of jons character and future actions "
"23" "Bellatrixlestrange" 2011-05-03 " agree with above comments that peter dinklage is the star of the show and hes clearly having the time of his life tyrion lannister is probably the best character in the book and there cant be many opportunities for a dwarf actor to play a parts so juicy or indeed so nuanced for the rest of the cast i like most of the starks but neither sansa nor robb is quite right for me im hoping the actors will grow into their roles disappointed that robb has been made darkhaired  in the books he is described as redheaded like his mother for television hes suffered the same fate as henry viii in the tudors and been degingered clearly viewers cant cope with the idea of a gingernut guy being anything other than comic relief aiden gillen was very good as petyr littlefinger baelish and in fact most of the cast have been excellent so far some of the dialogue has been a little clunky  lots of exposition to get through i guess  but some beautifully written scenes too like the exchange of war stories between the king and his guards cant wait for next weeks episode "
"24" "macster" 2011-05-03 " drsmurfsghost the animals are symbols for the noble houses wolf for stark stag for baratheon dragon for targaryen and lion for lannister the guide on the hbo site is pretty good for telling whos who for what and where httpviewersguidehbocomgameofthronesguidehouses "
"25" "DrSmurfsGhost" 2011-05-03 " i did find myself thinking yes yeeeeessss when tyrion finally pissed off the wall as so kindly worded above threatened it was an odd thought but the jests and comments in the previous episodes leading up to it made me chuckle when it actually happenedas for the episode my favourite episode so far with less then 20 seconds of nudity estimation and no actual sex scenes some decent dialouge and interesting facts about the seasons not to mention the great ending with arya dancing and neds remembering of his past battles and killsas long as they continue to show the fossilised dragon eggs in each episode however i will continue to hold hope that they might one day play a part in the story to come the transition from seemingly helpless girl to dothraki queen happened a little faster then i expected but its good id like to find out what shes going to do with this powerone more thing about the loresetting ive not read the books and i may have missed something in the show so forgive me for potentially being stupidin the title sequence therere four symbols around the words game of thrones a lion a dragon a deer and a wolf if i remember correctlyas far as i can tell the wolf represents the starkes as mentioned in the first episode you can see a deer on the empty seat in the council where the king is supposed to sit if he ever attends so i assume the deer represents the kingthe dothraki bargaining exiled prince says something in his fit of rage at being attacked for threatening his sister about him being the dragon so ill assume that the dragon represents himhis nationso whos the lion or is it a character we dont know yet and would be too spoilery to mention at this point in the programme "
"26" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-03 " peter drinklage  i think thats the actors name who plays the dwarf  is very impressive with him a lot of the acting is done with the eyes and a variety of subtle looks his character has immediate depth moreso than others in the cast totally agree for me he has been the star of the show so far the way he interacts with the other characters really brings them out as well prior to this episode id thought the jon snow charcter was a bit limp for example and the scene with neds brother was fantastic oh and as sarah hughes mentioned the scene where he pissed off the wall actually made me lol in true internet fashion as id been so drawn into the story i had completely forgotten him saying about it it ep 2 "
"27" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-03 " simonessex you know im really torn about it i love the books and i love watching it come to life this and dorothy dunnetts lymond chronicles were the two things ive most wanted to see adapted over the years but i think theres a real pleasure to being able to judge it purely as a television programme which is impossible when youve read the source material so im conflicted but only in a very minor way really i agree its definitely event television however i also havent waited in this way for a long long time oh and youre right neither scene was in the books and i thought both scenes were wonderfully done "
"28" "SimonEssex" 2011-05-03 " sarahhughes surely you dont really wish youd skipped the books for me part of the joy of watching so far has been seeing so much of what i imagined and enjoyed reading being fully realised on screen and the excitement and anticipation of the things you know are to come i thought this was the best episode so far loved the scenes at the wall old nans story to bran peter dinklage is so much fun as tyrion as always and the scenes across the sea with dany were much much improved two scenes in particular were highlights in terms of character development  and notable for not being in the book unless my memory is really bad robert exchanging war stories with ser barristan and jaimie and cersei schooling joffrey on revenge and ruling i completely agree with sarah about lena headeys excellent portrayal  cersei could easily have been played in broad pantomime villain strokes but on screen i find her  if not likeable  then at least understandable roll on next week since the advent of dvd box sets and sky i have become used to gorging myself on an entire series in a few sittings  having to wait a week for each episode is strangely comforting and nostalgic havent looked forward to a weekly tv event in ages like i do with this series "
"29" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-03 " greenstrings you have to stay strong and ignore the lure of the internet this is a series that will work much better if you stay unspoiled part of me rather wishes id never read the books at all because those of my friends who dont know what happens are getting so much enjoyment out of it "
"30" "allybalder" 2011-05-03 " made in belfast "
"31" "Lalwende" 2011-05-03 " im enjoying the way sean bean has been allowed to speak in his natural voice in this role when he played boromir it crept out a few times but hes letting rip with his sheffield accent here  two great examples when he said the name bessie in the last episode and in this one when he gave sansa her gift and said thats for you love i suppose the acid test is if he calls another man love its true that the scenesdialogue added in only add to it and dont spoil it at all to the extent ive had to flip back to the books and check for myself whether certain things were in them or not and so much of the rest has just been lifted right off the page  its testament to how good a writer george rr martin is really that they could lift charactersplotdialogue straight out of the books and they work equally well on screen "
"32" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-03 " formicaatomica its funny the way people react to castings  for me the great peter vaughn is perfect as aemon thr right level of frailty and age with hints of the strength and formidable past "
"33" "FormicaAtomica" 2011-05-03 " and also missing donal noye who was the one who actually gave jon snow the advice on not being too harsh to his brothers if i remember correctly if the series gets as far as the books they have to put him in "
"34" "FormicaAtomica" 2011-05-03 " not happy with maester aemons portrayal "
"35" "greenstrings" 2011-05-03 " the internet has the potential to completely ruin this show for me all it takes is an overlong glance at a wikipedia page and all cliffhangers fall away "
"36" "Kyza06" 2011-05-03 " havent read the books and realise that ill have to read them after each of the series have finished to avoid spoilers fantastic show tho  compelling brilliantly realised world some awesome characters arya  tyrion especially altho i hope theres more of old nan too i think i need to say again how utterly awesome tyrion is drinklage is excellent but the underlying characterbrilliant stuff only wish id waited til the series was finished so i could watch all 11 or 12 in 2 or 3 sessions "

"38" "Wayne123" 2011-05-03 " loving the nonreaders speculations and you will be surprised at just how many of you are making the same assumptions that i made reading  whether they were right or wrong though  that would be telling id also like to point out the stratospheric rise in sales of the books  check out the various bookselling websites and see just how the books are faring it is brilliant news and testament to hbo at just how right they were to adapt it i still have a third of a clash of kings to read although the other books adorn my bookcase in readiness ive been reading a lot of the reviews and i dont think i ve read a truly bad one yet which is also good im also pleased at how the story is focussing on just a few characters a week so that you dont get totally bogged down with too many characters all jostliong for screentime im also pleased at how the heraldry is being portrayed  sure we know the direwolf is the sigil of house stark but how many of you know the sigils for lannister and baratheon or their colours  and yet there they are on the screen  i expect next week there will be a good lesson in heraldry  as its important to see which houses are loyal to the larger houses im loving the detail as a book fan and how it it is understated in the tv series only coming out when its needed great stuff "

"47" "vk1980" 2011-05-03 " im finding this all quite weird having read the books etc etcon the one hand im happy to see a story ive enjoyed made real on the other i wish i hadnt read them so that i could enjoy the tv series without prior knowledge of eventsmy wife who hasnt read the books is seeing intrigue and clues and enjoying the beginnings of the characters developing im watching and thinking  can you make xyz plot point  upcoming twist  reveal any more obvious some of the camera shots and bits of dialogue to my mind are over emphasising what is to come thats not really a complaint as its good to be able to have an inkling of what is coming when youre watching a show im also surprised at how much of the dialogue is straight from the books and hasnt been cleaned up i dont mean censored in fact i think theyve added a few naughty words more a case of the difference between how something comes across differently when you hear it as opposed to reading it there have been a couple of occasions when i have winced a little reminding me of harrison ford to george lucas you can write this shit george but i cant say it the added scenes that have been inserted however are generally really good dialogue wise i also think that a lot of time has whizzed by in the first three episodes and it hasnt been made clear obviously they are getting towards the meat of the story now and can slow down the passage of time to give greater depth to motivations events reactions and so forth i just dont think that it is apparent that it takes weeks to travel from winterfell to kings landing and north to the wall i wouldnt advocate a  1 month later banner appearing on the screen but maybe a little more dialogue couldve been inserted all in all im quite happy i take it next week is the tournament looking forward to seeing gregor clegane  might be more of an impact if we were better aware on the tv of the stature and attitude of the hound seeing his big brother will still be good though "
"48" "Wayne123" 2011-05-03 " my one big concern was the children in this  a lot of the story is carried by the children and it is a very adult story but my fears are completely unfoundend maisie williams absolutely nails arya and doesnt make her look like comedy relief joffrey is as loathesome as he should be sansa is wet and yet she is not stupid bran dealing with his injuries was amazing acting from issac rickon alas is little more than a footnote but then he was at the same point in the books the older boys  jon snow and robb are beginning to come to terms with their new responsiblities  and portraying it well i have no fears anymore now we have moved the action to kings landing  we get a slew of brand new characters i hope new fans are able to keep up littlefinger and varys are right off the page it was good to see renly established lancel lannister roberts squire got a few scenes too up on the wall we had the rather sadistic ser alliser thorne maester aemon and the old bear himself ser jeor mormont who you will notice is the father of ser jorah mormont who is helping daenerys and viserys it was also good to see the greyness of some of the characters  who didnt have a pang of sympathy for jaime when he gave his reasoning for stabbing mad king aerys oh hang on though  he chucked a 10 year old out of a window or even joffrey when his mother spoke to him about being in a loveless marriage but didnt he threaten to kill arya that is what makes this series so great in that very few characters are inherently good or evil for instance how many of you gasped about the dagger belonging to tyrion and has that made you change your mind about him  after all he is a lannister  such questions will plague you in this series but of course  no spoilers from me im not saying another word about that the tv series is a book fans dream by allowing the story to develop without structural problems that a film has to contend with  the story is getting the treatment it deserves its also bloomin good viewing "
"49" "krm123" 2011-05-03 " another really good episode  its amazing how fast paced they are tearing through the book  i keep wishing they had even 2 more episodes to squeeze some more stuff in but its going great and they still have time to add little scenes and touches to fill out some of the characters "
"50" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-03 " first of all apologies for the typo  it should read petyr baelish and not peter but technology is rarely my friend and i didnt notice until too late sorry and on to the rest werthead agreed the scene between jorah and rakharo was subtle and wellacted im with you that the dothraki scenes were so much better this week and i honestly think thats in part because of the concentration on issues other than sex that said redwinter  your wish is my command i feel sorry for momoa actually as the character is more nuanced in sorry the books like sunburst im really enjoying the additional scenes like this and the one between robert barristan and jaime i think weiss and benioff have really captured the style and feel of the books while also managing to fashion something different of their own charliebronze there will be battles whether or not theyre epic is another matter entirely  after all part of the point of the series is the messy reality of war as opposed to the pretty songs sung by the victors spacedone it was my favourite episode as well and i agree with you about old nans monologue it was very well done "
"51" "EddieLarkin" 2011-05-03 " i do wonder if the character relationships are getting across well though did they explain in the episode that renly the only council member that eddard greets and embraces warmly was king roberts kid brother i dont think that came up neither did the fact that lancel lannister is roberts squire though they did rather clunkily make it clear that he was jaimes cousin did many people get that jorah mormont was the son of the commander of the nights watch i thought it was a nicely restrained move on the writers part not to have jorah talking about the father he shamed and then cut to lord jeor mormont talking to tyrion about the son who shamed him just to make sure we get it renly does refer to the king as my brother but it wasnt exactly clear ned should have said something like the last time i saw you you were only this big etc imply a closer relationship than just some court official i dont think anyone was supposed to get jorah and mormont are related really unless theyre really attentive with the names i reckon it will be explained more clearly when jeor gives jon longclaw "
"52" "EddieLarkin" 2011-05-03 " if the mad king aerys was so reviled why does everyone resent jaime for killing him was he ordered to kill the king or did he kill for his own ends jaime is a member of the kingsguard an elite order of knights who pledge their lives to the protection of the king and act as his personal guards it has not really been explained in the show but the kingsguard is revered across the seven kingdoms as being the most honourable job a warrior could aspire to jaime broke his vows and assassinated the king although it was for the right reasons he essentially sacrificed any honor he had and obviously cannot really be trusted now as a kings guard the only reason he was allowed to stay in the kingsguard was because his father helped win the rebellion so do we get any epic battles in this or is it just endless court intrigue not that theres anything wrong with that lots of epic battles but definitely more court intrigue there will only be a few minor ones this season but expect some pretty huge ones in the future a couple of things that occured while watching robert makes a point about the lannisters being blonde my initial thought was does that mean they are in some way related to viserys family sorry still not quite there on all the family names and then secondly that maybe joffrey is in fact not his son and the child of the queen and jaime the way she spoke to him about being us seemed to imply being a lannisterhowever if hes roberts son then he isnt is he just idle speculation nah the lannisters and the targaryens are not related the targaryen hair colour is supposed to come off as more silverwhite if you want me to really complicate things though ha ha the baratheons the king and his brothers are related to the targaryens first cousins to viserys and dany this doesnt have any bearing on the story though only that it is the reason why robert was chosen to take over as king rather than ned or jon arryn or anyone else because he had the most authentic claim i dont really consider this spoiler as there is no way they will bother explaining it in the show a good reason to pick up the books you get a lot more depth and back story "
"53" "Werthead" 2011-05-03 " whilst i enjoyed the kings landing stuff and events on the wall the biggest success of the show for me this week was finally giving us some dothraki scenes that werent embarrassing or badlyconceived instead rakharo and irri getting frosty with one another over who has to do what for daenerys was mildly amusing and rakharo jhogo in the books they swapped his name with a minor charcter because jhogo and drogo apparently sounded too similar and jorah swapping thoughts on the merits of westerosi and dothraki tactics was a grounded and convincing moment of two guys from two different cultures chatting about something they have in common viserys getting whipped to the face was merely a bonus the stuff with syro forel was cool as well i do wonder if the character relationships are getting across well though did they explain in the episode that renly the only council member that eddard greets and embraces warmly was king roberts kid brother i dont think that came up neither did the fact that lancel lannister is roberts squire though they did rather clunkily make it clear that he was jaimes cousin did many people get that jorah mormont was the son of the commander of the nights watch i thought it was a nicely restrained move on the writers part not to have jorah talking about the father he shamed and then cut to lord jeor mormont talking to tyrion about the son who shamed him just to make sure we get it also peter dinklage is so awesome as tyrion lannister that he just lifts up every scene hes in excellent performance just so it is known if the mad king aerys was so reviled why does everyone resent jaime for killing him was he ordered to kill the king or did he kill for his own ends episode 1 established that ned takes oaths and responsibilities very seriously hence him killing the deserter himself and so on so for ned there is no conflict jaime was a kingsguard sworn to protect aerys and should have done that no matter what because he had sworn an oath to do so no matter that he was on the wrong side and that someone else  robert or ned or whatever  would have had to have killed aerys themselves if jaime hadnt done it for ned the distinction is immensely important for others like jaime himself it isnt and is just semantics so do we get any epic battles in this or is it just endless court intrigue not that theres anything wrong with that exactly how much they can show of big battles is unclear their budget is huge but theyve made it clear theyve spent the money on the sets and actors not on huge action setpieces but then we also saw merlin do some reasonable cgi battle sequences last season on a tiny fraction of thrones budget so they should be able to do something more interesting than that "
"54" "Sunburst" 2011-05-03 " pillowhead my initial thought was does that mean they are in some way related to viserys family nope the lannisters are blonde but the targaryens are silverhaired its their trademark they also have lilac eyes in the books but not in the show apparently "
"55" "Sunburst" 2011-05-03 " it wont be endless court intrigue trust me brutal and bizarre things will start happening and soon i have to say i love all these new scenes  the ones that werent in the books i mean perhaps they feel like a breath of fresh air considering i am familiar with the story but theyre also very intelligently done with cersei last week and robert today actually come to think of it there was a whole lot of original scenes i like that "
"56" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-02 " really enjoyed this episode by far the best one yet all the stuff up at the wall was especially excellent i thought and story across the narrow sea has certainly improved which i think was helped by getting a bit more from the dothraki characters as well im also now seriously considering getting hold of the books waiting a week between episodes is always a drag when you get into something a couple of things that occured while watching robert makes a point about the lannisters being blonde my initial thought was does that mean they are in some way related to viserys family sorry still not quite there on all the family names and then secondly that maybe joffrey is in fact not his son and the child of the queen and jaime the way she spoke to him about being us seemed to imply being a lannisterhowever if hes roberts son then he isnt is he just idle speculation "
"57" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-02 " charliebronze i think it is the oath breaking he swore an oath to protect the king as part of the kingsguard not to mention the sword in the back "
"58" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-02 " really enjoyed tonights episode warning  dreaded phrase coming up ive read the books warning ive not been able to sit back and relax watching the show during the first couple of episodes mainly because of the whole book vs tv show thing but i think the show has settled down now probably more a case of me getting used to seeing the story via tv and i think they are doing a wonderful job of bring these characters to life some need more screen time to flesh out their presence although some good actors are doing a lot with the little time they have on screen loved the king robert do you remember your first  scene some perfect casting too varys and littlefinger  i can think of no others to fill those boots than conleth hill  aidan gillen really looking forward to the next few episodes "
"59" "CharlieBronze" 2011-05-02 " loved this episode and inigo montoya showing up at the end was great fun subtle bit of acting from sean bean as his mood switched from delight and pride to concern and fear as he watched arya train if the mad king aerys was so reviled why does everyone resent jaime for killing him was he ordered to kill the king or did he kill for his own ends so do we get any epic battles in this or is it just endless court intrigue not that theres anything wrong with that "
"60" "Spacedone" 2011-05-02 " barrybadrinath 2 may 2011 1021pm i am now thinking of ordering the books as i am really enjoying this but it will obviously ruin the series for me what to do now that were into the series id steer clear of the books at least until the first series is over so as not to spoil some of the plot points you can then read the book and appreciate the much greater depth of all the characters "
"61" "Spacedone" 2011-05-02 " i think i enjoyed that episode more than the previous two and i really liked both of them weve got over introducing the world and the characters and were getting to the meat of developing the characters and the plot the monologue from old nan was brilliant tyrion and jon snow at the wall were both great as was the scene with king robert jaime and ser barristan talking about their first kills oh and eddard throttling littlefinger d my only negative is that robbs character has been fairly neglected so far it might be like that in the book its been a while since i read it "
"62" "Lalwende" 2011-05-02 " it makes me squirm watching characters come to life on the screen knowing what the fates of some of them are i wonder if the series as it goes on and stuff happens will give me that punch in the face feeling like it does in the books i think it might even be harder as good as ever and getting better every time  more old nan please "
"63" "BarryBadrinath" 2011-05-02 " i really enjoyed that episode and although there was less action its ever more compelling and was gutted when it ended i thought the sword fighting teacher looked like robert downeyjunior tommy carcetti was good and it was very nice to see viserys getting taken down another cracking performance from sean bean  no one can do the the weary burden of a man with the world on his shoulders like him i am now thinking of ordering the books as i am really enjoying this but it will obviously ruin the series for me what to do "
"64" "redwinter" 2011-05-02 " enjoyed the episode immensely  it had the feel of settling into its stride and starting to explore the characters beyond the introductions weve had so far highlights for me  viserys getting bitchslapped the khaleesi starts to realise what that title really means and i firmly got the impression its the first time shes had any sense of her own power  the scene with bran and robb  brilliantly realised and i love that it may be the actions and recollections of a small boy that spell trouble for the lannisters the entire section at the wall it feels harsh and nasty and hopeless and filled with doom winter is coming indeed jorah mormont  loving iain glen and intrigued to find out more one plea on the gratuitous nudity count please please please can there be a specific jason momoa quota itd be nice if he had some you know lines to say as well "
