"3" "ChipMouse" 2013-04-27 " hi im a newbieim reading the books and not watching the hbo series because i dont have a tv however i have a question which i hope someone can answergrrms book three a storm of swords is in two partsdoes anyone know whether this hbo series 3 covers only part one  steel and snowor will it cover both parts  ive almost finished reading part 2 blood  goldbelieve it you guys not reading the books theres some absolutely jaw dropping stuff coming      "
"4" "ntofr1" 2013-04-27 " acertainbang  that mormont moment should have had at least some of the impact of neds offing not sure about that "

"7" "BrenhinesGwenhwyfar" 2013-04-26 " sunnyone  certainly i think many of the female characters that feel a bit sketchy in the books have been fleshedout and better served in the show shae margaery and even cersei i was so glad to see her as a pov character in a feast for crows but very disappointed with the slightly banal results have been improved by their screen airings the tv cersei is infinitely more subtle layered and sophisticated down to the duel efforts of the writers and lena headeys performance personally i cant wait for the sandsnakes "

"10" "johnnyG79" 2013-04-26 " theres an awesomeness to seeing thousands of soldiers marching from the air coupled with the rising score and the three dragons ever watchful it made for spectacularly epic viewing and sets ths season up in a tantilising way i didnt think possible "
"11" "realstokebloke" 2013-04-26 " acertainbang  completely agree the episode was a tad out of kilter somewhere in the murky world of screen time allocation  editing also makes you start to question the inclusion of other apparently less important scenes such as brans continued dream sequences  but you just have to trust bw that these will payoff in subsequent episodes but yes the comparison with neds scenes of demise isnt a good one  okay he wasnt a main protagonist but i still maintain its a shame for such a stout fellow and he arguably deserved more "
"12" "ACertainBang" 2013-04-26 " hazh  thanks for that hazh the clarification is much appreciated  "
"13" "ACertainBang" 2013-04-26 " realstokebloke  i also think the nights watch have been a bit short changed for screen time or the focus of the time they do have has been wrong or something it lessens the impact of their strife that mormont moment should have had at least some of the impact of neds offing but instead it was lost in a really busy episode "
"14" "realstokebloke" 2013-04-25 " ntofr1  cant believe i missed him must have been asleep then when he appeared previously then but thanks that said he done good poo propulsion in the keep shame about the outcome but as mentioned above somewhere what could we reasonably expect when the chips were down from a motley bunch of westeros rejects other than backstabbing and alike "

"17" "ntofr1" 2013-04-25 " realstokebloke  they most likely assume jon is dead dolorous ed did voice this possibility at end of season 2 i think and so it would not be worth wasting thought on him while they are up the skirling pass without a paddle burns character was in a couple of scenes last week but someone commented earlier that he has another show hes doing which may possibly mean they just brought him in to propel poo at the fan in crastors keep but who knows well see next week "
"18" "ntofr1" 2013-04-25 " oops just lost 2 hours and a half reading season 1 blogs and comments rewatched a couple of episodes and yes baelishs accent has changed and yes baelish was a way cooler character in season 1 so far i hope he gets some edgy stuff soon "
"19" "Knowslittle" 2013-04-25 " zombiedeadhead  thats a good shout from reading the books i thought one of the themes of the series was the slow transition to a society in which women were gaining in status most of the women that are making active power plays or are adopting more assertive and combative roles are around 20 or under arya margarey dany brienne just above them you have a generation of women that are frustrated by the fact they are capable of more but limited by the normsrules of the society cersei and cat especially but i guess lyanna stark woudl have been in this group as well oh and total conjecture on my part but sansa will rule westeros when the dust finally settles mark my words "
"20" "Knowslittle" 2013-04-25 " realstokebloke  and while were at it poor old mormont stabbed literally in the back an undeserving end for a top bloke  it was a great moment when he turned round and started strangling rast i thougth they should have let him kill rast before others of the nw killed mormont just a token bit of revenge for the viewers to enjoy "

"22" "realstokebloke" 2013-04-25 " johndear  did the watch actually know it was an infiltration mission though i thought they just went off led by halfhand to stop the wildings too easily observing their movements from the higher ground in which case they could conceivably have thought either that ones taking a while or rip halfhand snow  the guys i rather thought the infiltration bit was a last resort plan b conjured up by halfhand after they were captured to make the best of a bad situation but if the wider body of the watch mormont etc did know  i was snoozing my apols "
"23" "JohnDear" 2013-04-25 " realstokebloke  why would they miss him as far as they know hes still off on some infiltration mission with the halfhand "
"24" "realstokebloke" 2013-04-25 " and while were at it poor old mormont stabbed literally in the back an undeserving end for a top bloke shame we didnt  wont see  hear his final words in lieu thereof id suggest get the bastard who did it forget his name and is the burn gorman character a player now ive never set eyes on him before  except in revenge but thats quite ano story all in all i feel the bw are getting a little shortchanged here within the narrative and not one of them has as far as i can remember piped up wheres that bastard snow when you need him apparently not missed at all "

"37" "hazh" 2013-04-24 " acertainbang  the emperor concerned is qin shi huangdi the first emperor of china he is a highly controversial figure in china hated by the confucians because he supposedly burnt books and buried scholars alive he was viewed in a negative light throughout most of chinese history because confucianism was the dominant school of thought but was viewed positively by mao for his authoritarian rule chinese rulers sometimes feel the need to justify their rules by referring to the past and the first emperor is very much a figure used for the justification of maoist totalitarian rule "

"52" "crehane" 2013-04-24 " 5432hun  as characters and actors i love both varys and littlefinger theyre the two great mysteries in the game at the moment can any of us be truely confident that we know what their motivations are or what indeed either of them truely wants in the case of varys it appears to be the stability of the realm but he seems to have his own ideas of how best to achieve this just to job peoples memories it was he and illyrio the merchant in pentos who brokered danys wedding to khal drogo that arya overhead plotting in the catacombs beneath the red keep in kings landing so lest we forget from as far back as season 1 varys has had a hand in danys fate and fortunes then theres littlefinger according to his own admission of his not insubstantial ambitions from season 1 speaking to roz and one of the other whores he wants it all this is also reinforced by varys assessment that hed gladly burn kings landing to the ground if it meant that he could be king of the ashes however he is currently lord of harenhal and is on the verge of acquiring the vale at the expense of surrendering his post as master of coin are we to believe that he is really going to jeopardise all that he has already attained in a bid to smuggle out and free poor little sansa stark i think not doesnt fit the profile so that leaves us with the same burning question hanging over both characters oy mate whats your game "

"199" "CavalierDisregard" 2013-04-23 " that said i continue to think that one of this shows few weakness is that theyve bodged littlefingers character i have trouble believing hes a master puppeteer when ros and her cleavage of power seem able to outsmart him at every turn i feel i have to stick up for littlefinger here other than the scene in the second series where he overplayed his hand whilst talking to cersei i think the character is being handled well dodgy accent in the second series aside do we really think that littlefinger is foolish enough to let a prostitute that he threatened and allowed the queen to torture know all his secrets or is it more likely that he is aware that she is working for varys and feeding her information that he wants varys to know he is easily one of my favourite characters in the book and although he is maybe not quite as machiavellian in the show he is still a great character and unfairly maligned in my opinion "

"227" "5432Hun" 2013-04-23 " bluecalx  youve mentioned conleth hills varys before and youre absolutely right he just is him even in a show marked by its excellent casting he stands out as a perfect choice yes we have to remember he is an absolutely outstanding stage actor of great versatility so in a sense its a bit of an unfair comparison particularly when so many of the cast are so young but if i had to pick one performance as the best i think it would be his varys is a very complex character  a gameplayer of uncertain motivations who survives because he doesnt pose a perceived threat to the great and the good and is always just slightly more useful alive than dead the challenge must be to convincingly portray him as effete and subservient to the other players while giving the audience sufficient glimpses of the steel underneath a lesser actor might drown the character in camp but hill is so good that even varys most effete moments become creepy revelations of hidden determination for similar reasons im a big fan of john bradleys performance as sam in earlier episodes he provided comic relief but without slipping into fatman bufoonery and now his struggle with his own cowardice without histrionics the silent look of shame he had in ep1 when he couldnt look mormant in the face was one of the single best moments in the series imho "

"480" "Ryan Brighton" 2013-04-22 " mroneill  and my second biggest question is why did the young man that released theon same person right only kill his subsequent captors to bring him back where he originally released him from my only possible answer is that hes trying to make someone of power happy the series has a couple of nonbook characters and merged plotlines etc so noone whos read the books can answer that for sure which is kind of good im assuming the young man is meant to be one of two book characters both are highly sadistic and fond of nasty mindgames he released theon just to get his hopes up and make his return to the torture chamber that much more horrible is my opinion "

"512" "ChinofJim" 2013-04-22 " sharpmango  good point in medieval europe generally speaking armies were fed by way of pillaging the countryside which often meant sentencing the peasants to death by starvation daenerys has already shown she is not willing to let innocents suffer for her ambitions and what is more where they are there doesnt seem to be much coutryside to pillage "

"542" "dirtysexylibertine" 2013-04-22 " this was a brilliant episode i wrote down last week that dany selling her dragon was a bit far fetched and it looks like i was right the political power games of margaery and her family seems wasted when you factor in danys free army of unsullied and her dragons does anyone know of the history between house targaryen and house stark i only ask because it would be a shame to lose sansa to what will be danys roaring rampage of revenge "
