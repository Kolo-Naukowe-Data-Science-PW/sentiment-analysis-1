"2" "JimTheFish" 2012-05-27 " tho its true that this season has been a lot more meandering and lacking in fire literally than the first "
"3" "JimTheFish" 2012-05-27 " and this weeks award for needless pomposity goes to "
"4" "ProvisionalName" 2012-05-26 " im finding this season considerably more ponderous than the first which was superb but i will stick with it "

"7" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-25 " youd think    but hes also writing for some tv show    americas got talent i think    and writings of a short and novel length connected and unconnected to ice and fire    i think hes at it and all the novels are written and hes just trying to see how long people will wait for the next one    "
"8" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-25 " yes it was a little odd how often it was used almost like weve said it once lets keep saying it hehe "
"9" "Courtjezter" 2012-05-25 " surely he some more important books to finish writing first "
"10" "SummerBlade" 2012-05-24 " for a second last week i was convinced that the writers were going to change the story and have catelyn do something which i cant mention because it is a spoiler damn but it would have been a nice twist to the tale in my opinion "
"11" "SummerBlade" 2012-05-24 " oh yeah and if you look back on the first series interactions between ned and robert its there in the books too there is a palpable underlying tension between the two men mostly coming from ned "
"12" "SummerBlade" 2012-05-24 " yep this is my favourite theory and would explain why ned sulked in the north for so many years after helping his best friend to the throne theory complete speculation involving characters already mentioned in the tv series robert rapes neds sister lyanna she flees with the help of rhaegar and ned fights through to her only to discover her dying in childbirth and learns the awful truth about his friend the man he had made king of westeros it would also explain roberts psychopathic hatred of the targs which started with rhaegar it would also explain why ned buried lyanna far away from robert  near to her son like i said  a theory  "
"13" "OnlyLittleOldMe" 2012-05-24 " finally jack gleeson is lovely in real life and a student at trinity college dublin and interestingly trinity is where david and dan met while studying english so late with commenting but have to say having the varystyrion dialogue was joy though i thought the pace of the episode was very slow why must all the drama be in the big penultimate episode couldnt we at least have had dany actually enter the house of the undying as a cliff hanger "
"14" "lemonlace" 2012-05-24 " that said i think benioff and weiss dropped the ball by having catelyn be unaware that theon has supposedly hanged bran and rickon – in the books she frees jaime after learning of their deaths and its easier to see her as being driven by fear and despair i couldnt agree more her decision to free jaime makes a lot more sense in those circumstances and her intentions are good robbs reaction frustrated me a little though because in the books he forgives cat theyve both made tactical errors what with robbs marriage bw might have written themselves into quite the hole if some the fans theories about jeyne turn out to be true nonspoilerish clue it involves hips "
"15" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-24 " i know i debated whether to discuss that or not "
"16" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-24 " i see it was tyrion that was searching for arya he had sent bywater to seek her  if the gods are good bywater will find arya alive before robb learns shes missing lord jacelyn bywater known as ironhand is commander of the city watch of kings landing and captain of the mud gate he was appointed by tyrion after janos slynt was sent to the wall so now that arya is in the midst of making her escape from harrenhal will she retrieve needle from polliver who stole it when she was captured polliver was the man that knocked arya over when she ran to join the fight with yoren and he took needle from her polliver used needle to kill lommy who had asked to be carried so i hope she doesnt forget to retrieve it "
"17" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-24 " pillowhead22 may 2012 1002pma wee bit of net research seems to suggest that they are advertising for a 2030 year old for next season misfits iwan rheon is a good suggestion see him tonight on guardian darling show grandmas house    "

"20" "Mooklaws" 2012-05-24 " it may be just me and dont read on if you dont want bronn irreparably spoiled but just watched the latest episode and suddenly saw barry chuckle picking his nails and talking to tyrion now i cant unsee it "
"21" "Vestrit7" 2012-05-24 " because shes a child and hes her friend i really really doubt she is thinking in any way about his effectiveness or use this is the girl who served tywin lannister for weeks and then only just as hes leaving realised that having him killed might have been a good move remember too that arya like many others is quite psychologically damaged and would want to cling to any friends shes made shes  12 years old and in what is probably only a year or so she has gone from being a carefree child whose worst problems were getting into trouble during embroidery classes and catching sansas scorn to watching her father be executed being hunted down by soldiers killing a stable boy watching soldiers slaughter her travel companians being a prisoner and watching people be tortured to death and finally having two people killed on demand and seen the tortures and killings that have resulted from the second death and listening day in day out to one of the most powerful lords in the land plot the destruction of her brother and her homeland "
"22" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-24 " thats just a conceit in the design of the credits    ahrahr has a book out later this year which should show us the geography and larger history of the world    "
"23" "MeCavity" 2012-05-24 " sorry possible spoiler question look away now but the opening sequence shows the maps and the cities in their wonderful machinations however the maps scrolls upwards and over and it all rather looks like a dyson sphere or possibly an orbital right or wrong "
"24" "5432Hun" 2012-05-24 " what baffles me in both the series and the books is why arya is so insistent on taking hot pie on the escape with her hes fairly objectionable somewhat dimwitted and a coward unless they have to win favour with the mountain by offering him a fruit flan i cant see what hot pie has to offer to the situation it hasnt really come across so much on tv because the story has been shortened but arya feels a sense of responsibility to her compainions from the journey north remember whose daughter she is "
"25" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-24 " acertainbang 24 may 2012 203am hell be a total gooseberry in the arry  gendry dynamic could be funny to watch though hes about 20 and aryas about 12   ewww    although maisies about 15 just looks younger    "
"26" "ACertainBang" 2012-05-24 " hell be a total gooseberry in the arry  gendry dynamic could be funny to watch though its good that we get to see some compassion from arya so many have died for  because of her and that number is surely going to keep climbing plus if they run out of food "
"27" "Kirjava13" 2012-05-23 " whats he to do if he keeps jaime then as far as he knows sansa and arya remain prisoners if he offers to trade jaime what then surely the lannisters will keep the fact that they only have sansa to themselves as long as possible and they probably wont swap one lannister for two starks then robb has one sister back and the kingslayer one of if not the most able swordsmen in the seven kingdoms running around again in the lannister armies free to kill anyone who stands against him so either he has no sisters and a valuable hostage or one sister and a lethal enemy back in the game its hardly an easy decision "
"28" "miapatrick" 2012-05-23 " frankly i havent read more then the first few chapters of the first book and ive thought this for a while right down to the later jondany union regarding jons parenthood i think the clues were already there a few episodes into season one and apparently its not been revealed in the books anyway so no spoilerregarding jondany possible union while neds death was a bit of a shake up i would stay that these are two of the characters least likely to suddenly die mostly because their story lines happen at such a distance from the rest she has a growing cult the dragons and the far off lands he has the nightwatch and the others and over the wall if these six factors have any significance which they must do or why spend money filming them then these two characters are not only important but downright essential so if this part was a spoiler on your part it wasnt much of onetry harder "
"29" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-23 " i agree i think robb is a bit out of order for not swapping jaime for even one of his sisters think im with cat too in this case "
"30" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-23 " what baffles me in both the series and the books is why arya is so insistent on taking hot pie on the escape with her hes fairly objectionable somewhat dimwitted and a coward unless they have to win favour with the mountain by offering him a fruit flan i cant see what hot pie has to offer to the situation i think its neat how grrm does not sanitise out difference and disability just as sam is tubby and a coward at the wall and beyond and this spurs jon to support him hot pie surely fills a similar role for arya no doubt shell come to find he has a key role for her and her plans at some point "

"32" "pillroad" 2012-05-23 " regarding catelyns release of jaime  im not so critical of the logicstupidity of this act as most posters seem to be as catelyn says she has five children and only one of them is with her she hasnt yet heard that bran and rickon are supposedly dead she is desperate to get all her children back especially sansa and arya whom she believes to be hostages in kings landing the deal presumably was that brienne takes jaime in chains to kings landing and exchanges him for her daughters although not revealed onscreen i ssume that jaime agreed to this and that catelyn was relying on the principle much stressed in this series that lannisters pay their debts in short a mothers love and her faith in some vestige of honour in jaime lannister overrode robbs shortsighted and stupid strategy of throwing jaime to the wolves in order to ensure the loyalty of his vengeful bannermen at the expense of his sisters im with catelyn on this one  give her a break folks also it isnt jaimes honour shes relying on its tyrions if you remember in season 1 she witnessed him pay off a jailer who tormented him because he made a promise the original offer to swap jaime for the girls comes from tyrion and cat knows this "

"35" "5432Hun" 2012-05-23 " i suspect jojen and meera and little walder and big walder were all written out because of the strict regulatory requirements on child actors the producers probably decided to cut out all nonessential young characters also child actors have a bad habit of growing up too quickly they could just do the trick they did with dany and age them make meera say 1617 and jojen1415 then you can get older actors to play them theyre supposed to be small anyway so just pick someone short i think its simpler than that clash of kings introduces an absolute shedload of new characters as the story both expands and fragments i just think theyve had to be very ruthless about who makes it onto the tv screen "
"36" "5432Hun" 2012-05-23 " i was right to assume that it was all far too obvious i had actually wondered if they might make no mention of them for a few weeks  have the news of their deaths spread around the kingdom  then have the final scene of the series be them emerging from the crypt this could have been a good idea a longer build up to the reveal might have put some doubt in peoples minds as it is i dont know anyone who thought it was bran and rickon one possible barrier could have been that we dont know at what point that storyline will be left at the end of the series it might be left earlier than we expect im hoping that talisa might actually become an important tv character rather than just a variation on the book character if so her line children do not always think that about their fathers believe me might be significant interesting theory it does seem a loaded comment now you mention it i can think of a couple of different possibilities but cant discuss them for risk of spoilering "

"40" "badger1969" 2012-05-23 " other comments from this weeks episode at the time i was watching i did have the same view as others about catelyns main motivation from the books for releasing jaime being gone but thinking back to her fears last week that jaime would be dead by morning  tyrions offer via littlefinger episode 3  i think there was enough there certainly she knows that a dead jaime would likely mean a dead sansa   she assumes arya too not sure that her other two children not being dead would change her attitude on this didnt comment last week but wondered how nonbook readers would react to the dead boys scene i was right to assume that it was all far too obvious i had actually wondered if they might make no mention of them for a few weeks  have the news of their deaths spread around the kingdom  then have the final scene of the series be them emerging from the crypt agree that the dany scene was superfluous this week also thought that the scene between roose  robb talking about rooses son was a bit of a repetition too i actually thought robb had agreed to this a few episodes back  presumably not im hoping that talisa might actually become an important tv character rather than just a variation on the book character if so her line children do not always think that about their fathers believe me might be significant especially given how little weve seen of those characters i thought the eddgrennsam scene was a terrific example of getting something small yet hugely significant from the books on to the screen "

"48" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-23 " i think its legitimate if talking about the episode just watched but when making conjecture about future episodes and how they will square circles with regards to whats been misssed out from the book it is pretty frustrating for people who have not read the book i find myself having to breeze past such posts dont get me wrong conjecture is great but when its oh that didnt happen in the book i wonder how they will introduce x and y character now and how this will tie into z plot thread i know some people take great care not to give spoilers away but   i agree in general but i do like to compare what has already been shown with what ive read it should not be hard to do so without spoilering and so far i think the blog is doing that ok and if there are chats about how this or that will fit given this or that has been missed out then like you say  lifes a breeze and we can just skim read onwards "

"50" "yingguoguizi" 2012-05-23 " respectfully as someone who avidly follows this blog every week interested in the opinions of others regarding each episode i really wish people would stop going on about the book especially giving away potential spoilers and talking about possible future characters there must be other places on the internet where people can chat about the adaptation of the book and all the discrepencies etc rather than keep banging on about it here i think its legitimate if talking about the episode just watched but when making conjecture about future episodes and how they will square circles with regards to whats been misssed out from the book it is pretty frustrating for people who have not read the book i find myself having to breeze past such posts dont get me wrong conjecture is great but when its oh that didnt happen in the book i wonder how they will introduce x and y character now and how this will tie into z plot thread i know some people take great care not to give spoilers away but some obviously couldnt care less about others enjoyment of the series "

"55" "5432Hun" 2012-05-23 " somethings niggling me why would varys refer to bronns brand of summary justice as extreme measures when in the tv series at least havent read the books the kings of westeros and their designated agents seem to have absolute power of life and death over their subjects unhindered by anything resembling rule of law good point i can see why politically varys might think it is a bad move ie city on verge of siege likelihood of common folk revolting etc but id be surprised if he had any great moral objection "

"64" "ACertainBang" 2012-05-23 " response to diamonddag and others i know what you are saying about the somewhat unsatisfying pacing and construction but then when i think back on the episode or even better  rewatch it there are so many great little moments  a fusty mojoless pedant like stannis gets a laugh talking about chatauvin genius  varys who didnt cheer when he appeared in his yellow kimono and enjoy every minute of his teasing refusal to bare all his cards at tyrions insistence that imminent war may be more important than game playing  quorins sacrifice aryas clever escape plan briennes steadfast belief that she can counter jaime with rationality even jorahs line to dany i wonder if it would improve the impact of the shorter scenes if flyby visits were left out of some episodes and served together in meatier installments or perhaps as i suspect when the season is done and we watch them back knowing their outcome they will be more satisfying of course this is still a problem for week by week viewing it might be that a lack of any consistent way of showing us how time is passing is what is throwing us im not suggesting a 24 style countdown clock would be approriate to build up the tension to a medieval times siege but maybe they could come up with something oh and these next two episodes are going to go off "
"65" "DiamondDag" 2012-05-23 " im late to party but oh dear the writers seem to be losing it a bit danys story has been treading water for almost the entire series either change the story from the books bring some stuff forward or just have her not appear much this series dont just give us five minutes of absolutely nothing i mean that scene we had was completely and utterly redundant to the story we learnt nothing from it in the eighth episode out of ten do we really need a bit of pointless padding when you have a character in the last episode being told go to the house of the undying you really really dont need to then show us that character saying you know what i might just go to the house of the undying like that guy said last week if you think people cant remember put it in the previously bit and get on with the bloody story or just dont even bother as sarah and others have stated omitting the fact that cat is grieving for the loss of two sons when she releases jaimie is just baffling it turns an act of pure desperation into one of pure stupidity even though throughout two series cat has been shown to be one of the most levelheaded people in robbs camp i dont get it also i understand why robbs falling in love needs to be beefed up for the show it was never given much time in the books and doing it like that here wouldnt work its just so dull and cliched i was almost tempted to skip ahead when dr quinn was telling her story i think richard madden is playing the part of robb just fine but hes not got much to work with the poor guy also have i missed something or has greatjon umber and most of robbs council just vanished did they ever bother to explain they are off fighting or something the way they had arya naming jaqen was so underwhelming it made my heart sink so other than the few safe bets conleth hill jerome flynn this was not the shows finest hour in my humble opinion and this isnt about deviations from the books ive said before that i think the show needs to make changes to streamline the story but for every wonderful bit of plotting that condenses the story and adds great scenes aryatywin they go and pad out bits in rather stupid ways and then just plain waste time they end up condensing nothing and are left struggling to give plots enough time to feel important anyway sorry that was mostly jumbled ranting this episode got on my nerves "

"157" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-22 " good post  i think on reflection youre right about twyin and arya i particularly like the point about the fatherdaughter relationship i think that if i have any real complaints about this season its that im not entirely sure that benioff and weiss actually have kept their grip on the material it does meander a bit the pace is off a little we could easily have dropped jon and danys story lines this week and picked up later by contrast weve seen so little of stannis that the fact hes about to invade doesnt seem quite as monumental to me at least as it should plus they completely botched bran rickon and the farm boys the audience should think that its bran and rickon hanging there its a huge error that we were so hit over the head with the farm boys the farm boys that nobody really entertained it plus as mentioned not having catelyn believe it removes much of her agency over the decision regarding jaime finally jack gleeson is lovely in real life and a student at trinity college dublin "

"164" "5432Hun" 2012-05-22 " i agree to the extent that some of the plotting has come a bit loose in the last couple of weeks and the orphanskilledinsteadofprinces bit was impossible to miss everyone who has not read the books is now saying to themselves brotherhood eh what the fcuk is the brotherhood  and think of all the time weve wasted with ros and shae the funny whore on this point theyve mentioned the brotherhood a few times in the past few weeks theyre obviouly setting them up to play a part next season which makes sense by making the audience aware of them and then well get exposition on who they are in due course given the complexities of the plot i think thats a reasonable compromise "

"167" "5432Hun" 2012-05-22 " havent read any of the comments yet but a couple of points from sarahs blog i dont think arya intended to kill tywin all along i think she was a scared little girl grateful to be out of that cage at first the idea of having him killed began last week with the bit about the knife and his neck and crystallised this week when he announced he would ride out to meet robb one interesting point weve speculated over the last few blogs about the surrogate fatherdaughter nature of their relationship i liked the fact that her decision to off him came as a consequence not just of him going to fight robb but also after her made it clear she would be staying at harrenhall another father lost four times orphaned now i agree about the problem with motivation for catelyn to release jaime its just about credible that in the extreme grief of hearing about branrickon she would do somethign so stupid but as played out it came across a bit like she was just doing it to piss off rickard karstark as a result what is really an absolutely pivotal moment in the whole asoiaf story just came across as catelyn being a bit menopausal robb and dr quinn im ok with this without spoilering i think they can manage potential plot holes ok just by continuing to leave out characters who arent there it is a little cliched but i thought the scene came across as quite natural they are a very believable couple and dr quinn does have an incredibly cute bottom finally just a quick word on the tyrionvarys scene i thought jack gleeson deserved some of the praise as well he plays that appalling little shit joffrey so convincingly he is a either a fantastic actor or that what he is really like i hope its the first i cant think of another character in fiction i more want to slap although samwise gamgee comes close "

"239" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-05-21 " agree that theyve moved the narrative around unnecessarily with the medicine woman but the actress is still doing a good job of it delighted to see more of jamie too personally delighted to see more of medicine woman very sensitively done long may it continue  "
"240" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-21 " and kidnap and rape was roberts view on what happened if you look deeper he was bitter at losing her to rhaeger and things seemed a lot more consenual to other people    "
"241" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-21 " from reading the books we still havent been told absolutely who jons mother is but most people are leaning towards what youre suggesting being the case    although it is a bit spoilery when putting the case as bluntly as you did    "
"242" "ntofr1" 2012-05-21 " of course i dont know for sure but i dont think ned is jons father i would wager that he is the son of neds dead sister lyanna who was supposed to be robert baratheons queen before she was kidnapped and raped by rhaegar targaryen either of those could be the father giving jon a claim to the throne if he is indeed rhaegars son then he would be related to dany the targaryens wed brother to sister uncle to niece and had all manor of incestuous marriages which could lead to the possibility of a jondany uniting the kingdoms scenario in the last books and jon may well have power over dragons too ice dragons  also if rhaegar is the father it might explain why ned was so keen to prevent robert from sending assassins after dany and her brother as they would be his own distant and jons closer kin just to assert again if anyone thinks im giving spoilers this is pure supposition any thoughts "
"243" "jackman" 2012-05-21 " lots of wonderful two and three hander scenes this week im not a book reader yet so i honestly dont know whats going to happen jamie  brienne  cant wait to see this developing  an odd couple in the making perhapstyrion  bron  fashion sense for the modern kings landing man does not include cloakstyrion bron  varys  sublime and very funny just the looks and reactions made this the highlight of the episode for metyrion  varys  who to choose between peter dinklage and conleth hill for acting honours both are excellent here and varys knows about dany being alive and having dragons would love to know how far his tentacles reach to think that poor petyr has to play wheres littlefinger every week another best line of the night from varys if we are going to play you have to startstannis  davos  finally understood why stannis is such a mumbly grumpy git dont trust roose bolton one bit have we met his bastard i could hazard a guess hes assisting someone else up north topless robb  thats just for me can i wear the gold cloak if bronn doesnt want it "
"244" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-21 " at a guess april next year    same as 1  2 "
"245" "ntofr1" 2012-05-21 " btw preview pic of bronn for next weeks episode looks amazing  "
"246" "Foxiix" 2012-05-21 " good grief these characters are more stupid than sacks of rocks which probably explains so much history and the current state of everything one does wonder how weve survived so long by outbreeding everything else "
"247" "ntofr1" 2012-05-21 " tyrion had it off with ros in the beginning of the first season up in winterfell and cersei mentioned a lion pendent so presumably he gave her a gift bearing the sigil of his house thus leading to cerseis misunderstanding "
"248" "ntofr1" 2012-05-21 " dont read it if you havent seen it this blog is also read by people in the us its the internet for gods sake sh1t happens "
"249" "hazh" 2012-05-21 " this season seems to have problem with pacing some episodes feel rushed and this episode feels slow "
"250" "HonestIago" 2012-05-21 " ashayara is a bit too dour for my tastes ive always though of her as being a bit lighter a bit more flippant her plea to theon was powerful though and it really showed just how much trouble theon is in really looking forward to the jaimiebrienne roadriver trip for my money the 3 fighters jaimie was referring to were ser barristan the hound and oberyn martell ruling out the mountain because apart from his size and strength he doesnt seem to have anything else going for him and ser loras because hes just a bit rubbish in both book and series the ultimate buddy movie has to be varys and tyrion with bron to keep them safe of the road every single scene between varys and tyrion is a classic cerseis return to form was pretty expected  there was always going to be a backlash to her being a person last week rather than as crackedcom said the personification of evil with lovely tits "
"251" "SimonEllicott" 2012-05-21 " got is still the highlight of the week either on the internet tv or both fantastic production values again i find myself being lost in these worlds with only two episode left i know that i am going to be bereft when the season ends does anybody know when season 3 will be broadcast "
"252" "weewilkie" 2012-05-21 " aye well maybe a cup or two but that was it i didnt do anything else with her 908 "
"253" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-05-21 " my dearest wilkie of wee you surely meant our beloved king stannis73 whose smoke the red priestess bore you may have had one wine too many in the company of queen regent "
"254" "Woof73" 2012-05-21 " the landscapes changed a bit dramatically for everyone in the years of summer when peace sort of reigned the only way to judge a knights quality would be at the tourney since jaime is judged by that criteria its only logical that he judges the competition in the same way ser loras would have definitely been competition for him in his tourney days he wouldnt be impressed but hed surely be wary now that everyones at war its that much harder to quantify im not sure jaimes seen the hound fight like we have he humiliated the mountain at that tourney in series 1 but im not sure where jaime was at the time maybe the scrap with ned has left jaime shaken enough to realise that some knights like ned dont fuck about with tournaments they prove themselves in battle so perhaps hes holding the coveted third spot open for the unnamed combatant that he underestimates not likely though maybe its tywin who could defeat him just by gazing sternly at him "
"255" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-05-21 " i would love to invite tywin along with his erstwhile cup bearer but the something tells me that it would be a bad idea to have the father and the son at the same table also i would prefer to have ser davos i would keep stannis away even from the kitchen two more anyone "
"256" "weewilkie" 2012-05-21 " ah sorry mistake  that was a response to objectinspace about the dinner party i think it must have been neds dead baby that came slithering out of the red priestess that made me do it its controlling my hands i tells ya "
"257" "weewilkie" 2012-05-21 " is arya serving "
"258" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-05-21 " dialogue of the weektyrion i wish we could converse as two honest intelligent menvarys i wish we could too "
"259" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-05-21 " the head is dark and full of errors "
"260" "objectinspace" 2012-05-21 " i disagree dont think jamie has ever been impressed by loras possibly because he reminds him of himself at that age i took the sardonic older lannister son to be referring to barristan the mountain and  even if hes not a knight  the houndnerdbait taken "
"261" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-21 " as weve learned this week    if a principal which syrio wasnt dies offscreen then theyre probably not dead    what weve also learned that if a characteractor is popular which syrio certainly was his onscreen fate may differ from that of the book    syrios probably dead though    ned absolutely is    "
"262" "BaronVonH" 2012-05-21 " just have to play the contrarian thanks to the guardian for posting this blog in time for my monday morning reading after sunday night viewing of game of thrones the timing is perfect for us readers in the us "
"263" "objectinspace" 2012-05-21 " excellent episode agree that theyve moved the narrative around unnecessarily with the medicine woman but the actress is still doing a good job of it delighted to see more of jamie too re the road movie a hard choice could we have bronntyrion  varys as a treble also what would be the perfect got dinner party you and six guests obviously tyrion makes the list varys too the rest is hard to callthough certain characters yet to come into the tv show would have strong claims "
"264" "BenjyUK" 2012-05-21 " just to keep the dream alive it can neither be confirmed nor denied that syrio is actually dead whilst it certainly appears so half a wooden sword vs fully armoured and armed kingsguard even us book readers dont know for sure "
"265" "BenjyUK" 2012-05-21 " how hilarious was the lord of bones definitely on par with quaithes greengold abomination of a mask "
"266" "Courtjezter" 2012-05-21 " and such dark hair he has "
"267" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-05-21 " are we sure that jon snow is neds bastard i am pretty sure he inherits the dna that make him so stupid from catelyn baaah have any of catelyns decisions ever been right "
"268" "Courtjezter" 2012-05-21 " or are you offering up a dead baby fathered by ned stark as a viable option "
"269" "weewilkie" 2012-05-21 " oh thanks spoiler much  "
"270" "Courtjezter" 2012-05-21 " so is syrio "
"271" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-21 " neds dead baby    "
"272" "Courtjezter" 2012-05-21 " ned stark had him in the first series prior to the spear in the leg incident "
"273" "Woof73" 2012-05-21 " barristan and the mountain certainly the third is probably ser loras which is sure to make brienne smirk since she handed the knight of flowers his lillywhite arse just a few weeks ago i agree with other commenters the hound probably doesnt count as far as hes concerned and therefore nor does bronn either that or the writers were throwing out some nerdbait "
"274" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-21 " id like to see bron against jaime "
"275" "SiccarPoint" 2012-05-21 " oooh  nice leftfield call not sure if syrio would be on jaimes radar though im guessing this will be a proper knight or lord i suppose the knight of the flowers should also be on the list though he hasnt appeared to be that awesome on screen yet "
"276" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-21 " yes i dont think you could have a proper fight between one person with a sword and another with a spear "
"277" "weewilkie" 2012-05-21 " syrio forel  "
"278" "SiccarPoint" 2012-05-21 " i think we all know what the real discussion point is from this episode who are the three people jaime thinks would have a chance against him in a fight for my money its barristan the mountain and a n other either the hound though i suspect jaime would think he was beneath him or perhaps oberyn martell which is of course cheating as we havent met him in the series also fights with a spear so probably also not considered by jaime i fairly sure were talking swordfighting here "
"279" "Definatelynotashark" 2012-05-21 " joffreys a proper little shit isnt he "

"281" "LadyVanessaFeltz" 2012-05-21 " regarding ros i think cersei said something about a lions necklace she was wearing my thoughts turned to doddery old grand maester pycelle giving it to her  hes loyal to the lannisters apparently so might possess such an item and had a scene with ros in last seasons final episode anyway an enjoyable episode i especially liked that tyrionvarysbronn scene on the pronunciation of the maesters name hell i like any scene with one of those 3 in no more tywin and ayra  "
"282" "Woof73" 2012-05-21 " havent seen the episode yet but i think ros the pros received a gift from tyrion in the very first episode or at some point while he was still in winterfell cersei must have assumed that she followed tyrion to kings landing because she was his favourite not realising that the real reason she travelled south was so that she could provide a little ta in the background while boring fullyclothed exposition was going on somewhere else not the writers finest hour but hey all the rest has been good "
"283" "weewilkie" 2012-05-21 " and robb shamelessly trying to get drink down talisas neck was very unkingly  "
"284" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-21 " sinequanone 21 may 2012 233pm some explanation is required for ros mistaken identity i thought for sure last week that shea would be revealed to cersei    but not sure whats led her to ros except maybes a bottle or two   book spoiler for events that happened differently and thus cant now occur in the show   in the book cersei has aliliyasp a madame of a whore house that tyrion frequents in which there is a secret passage ooer missus that takes him to shea    and thus cerseis men following tyrion come to the conclusion that its her hes visiting   no such relationship has been established with ros    we saw the two of them together in the very first episode and tyrion hired her almost to her death for joffreys name day    what from this has led to her being viewed as his true love can only be seen through wine goggles by winey mcwine    also just caught the last few episodes of south park and theres a great one where the kids are being taught history by mr garrison    only thing is hes teaching them about westeros and the war of the five kings    "
"285" "weewilkie" 2012-05-21 " i also found the scene between tyrion and shae very moving all in all this was a setup episode for the crash bang wallop to come a man can be excited about this "
"286" "weewilkie" 2012-05-21 " in the inside the episode they say that tyrion gave ros a lion necklace way back when they shagged at winterfell this is what cercei took as confirmation of his affections "
"287" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-21 " ive watched it too and i have a nice widescreen computer monitor to watch it on d somewhat an intermediate episode but a few things tied up was pleased that yara agreed with what many thought on here  that theon taking winterfell was a waste of time and rather stupid agreed that probably the best bit was davos and stannis and the dogs comments am warming to stannis i am not a book reader but cant help feeling that joffrey might be about to do something cleverbravelucky  i think that would be an amusing twist id nearly forgotten about gendry him and arya might make a lovely king and queen no spoilers plz some explanation is required for ros mistaken identity the fact that roose bolton keeps going on about his bastard indicates to me he will appear one day even if it is in the next season seems a bit pointless and teasing for book readers otherwise lucky robb thats all i can say  "
"288" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-21 " so you do illegally download shows    also why read the blog about an episode you havent watched and not expect to read a spoiler or twoand you can watch shows on your television thatve been acquired through illicit means    "
"289" "martis1" 2012-05-21 " this was a poorly paced episode where very very little actually happens there have been a couple of these filler hours this season ffs if nothing is going to happen with those baby dragons for a few years yet then just forget those characters and come back to them in season 5 or whenever they become relevant "
"290" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-21 " phew    that wasnt bran and rickons bodies strung up last week    seriously did anyone think it actually wasso ros has finally fulfilled her story purpose    but what led cerseis people to think that she was his belovedhe didnt use her services that we know of in kings landing although the 2 characters were introduced together in season 1 episode 1 and hired her for joffreys late name day present    think cerseis hitting the wine a bit hard   disappointed in aryas last request to unname hagar    help us escape    not as grand or selfless as in print   yay    jaime and brienne on the road to kings landing    ah the banter   booh    looks like tyrion and brons odd couple are going their separate ways    "
"291" "Frances56" 2012-05-21 " i smiled when i saw arya frowned when once the scene was done she hadnt exchanged even the slightest word with tywinonly two more episodes eeeek  summer is coming "

"293" "sharpeiboy" 2012-05-21 " i ve watched it florence  its clear that you dont post here a lot because others have complained about this for every episode so far saying exactly the same thing  sh  others have argued back  so on  so on i suppose every episode in the future will get the same treatment just look on it as the credits for the programme similar every week only the words change in this world of westeros which is as classbound as deal in the 1950s im getting sick of this closeness between robb  his doctorlady you might act that way in california in the 90s but most definitely not in robbs camp im becoming more  more annoyed by this seems much more dawsons creek than a game of thrones if only because the rest is pretty excellent  well conceived what a dark epidode in terms of lighting "
"294" "MurrayOstril" 2012-05-21 " people in the uk dont get to watch got until monday evening learn to internet florence58 a cracking episode all round i thought so glad to have varys back on screen his scenes with tyrion are golden "
