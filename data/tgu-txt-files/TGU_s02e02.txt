"3" "chutzzpah" 2012-04-11 " i would just like to ask once again very nicely if this blog could not be held over until monday personally i dont think they deserve to be asked nicely the comments were overun with people who were unhappy  not only have they not moved it they havent even commented on the furore they caused or gave a reason as to why they had chosen to completely ignore ther people that essentially pay their wages fuck em  i will do my blogging on some fan site "
"4" "DiamondDag" 2012-04-11 " sorry i was responding to clarebelzs post objecting to the graphic nature of some scenes should have been more clear in general id say hbos clear desperation to have titillation alongside the violence does get in the way the books didnt shy away from graphic depictions of sex but then the books werent running under time constraints it continues to baffle me that hbo and the writers acknowledge how tight it is to fit things into 10 episodes and then proceed to waste time with superfluous scenes someone mentioned earlier that on the dvd commentary a producer said ros is being set up as part of a bigger event later in the series so i guess were just going to have to live with the pointless brothel sexposition "

"6" "5432Hun" 2012-04-11 " it still amazes me how people can get so worked up about sex in film and television and not even bat an eyelid about the violence in general youre right but im not sure anyone here is objecting to sex per se are they you only need a passing acquaintance with the seriesbooks to realise theres going to have to be some sex in it or the whole narrative will end in episode 1 its more a question of whether a the sex has a point in terms of the plot and characters andor b whether that screen time could be spent somewhere else stannis shagging mel advances the plot littlefinger spying on a blowjob doesnt tell us anything we dont know about him or take the plot anywhere the conversation with ros if it was necessary at all could just as easily have happened without the preceding voyeurism im not personally bothered by sex on screen i just dont want them to waste the 50 minutes they have each week to tell me the story "
"7" "5432Hun" 2012-04-11 " i think ros is quite a useful character in kings landing because she can represent a kind of public morality insofar as such a thing exists in such a cesspool some minor slightly less psychotic kings landing characters have been lost in translation to the screen so we would be lwft with just the players like varys littlefinger etc none of whom noticeably give a shit that joffrey has been slaughtering babies tyrion cares a bit but is mostly concerned with the polirtical ramifications theres also no bywater and bronn cant suddenly start caring about such things so ros basically gets the job of representing public disquiet with joffreycerseis actions as series 2 moves on my guess is ros continues to be used to bounce plotsexposition off which would have required additional characters from the books "
"8" "DiamondDag" 2012-04-11 " it still amazes me how people can get so worked up about sex in film and television and not even bat an eyelid about the violence showing two people engaging in an act that pretty much every adult does is disgusting showing a man plummeting to his death and then being dragged away in a puddle of his own blood gets no mention babies get murdered for gods sake its so comically backwards that sex is something to find offensive while watching someones face get smashed in is just part of the drama "
"9" "sunnyone" 2012-04-11 " the other point i would make is that the unnecessary nonplot specific sex is taking up precious screen time that could be given over to eg building up the tension between theon and yara prior to the reveal which seems a shame when they are already facing an uphill task compressing the source material i said precisely this though not so elegantly some time back i have no objection to scenes that are not in the book being added if they help the action along or clarify motivation etc viz stannis humping melisandre but littlefingerros and the brothel scenes are entirely de trop anyway i really dont find it credible that ros and we never did find out how she made the journey from winterfell and climbed her chosen career ladder so quickly would have been so affected by the babys death shes surely made of sterner stuff "
"10" "TheSub" 2012-04-11 " which is relevant to the plot without resorting to peepholes and unhygenic practices with handkerchiefs youre being far too optimistic about the hygienic standards of littlefingers brothel it looked more like a wellused rag to me having said that i must also say that i agree with you they should rather get rid of some of the silly detail like wellused sordid rags and channel that energy into other parts of the show "

"14" "monders" 2012-04-11 " i personally found this weeks episode a bit over the top for plot and character reasons which i wont go into i think the scenes with theon and stannismel made sense but i thought the voyeuristic element of littlefingers brothel scene was a bit gross and unnecessary given they had hit their ta quortient for the episode with the other two scenes it wont stop me watching but i hope they reign it in a bit over the rest of the series i agree fully with 5432hun i love a bit of tits on the tele but id switched over from embarrasing bodies and was fully boobd out by 920 "
"15" "5432Hun" 2012-04-11 " on the question of children watching  parents need to take responsibility younger children should be in bed not watching postwatershed tv older children probably already watch and share worse than this anyway but the same principle applies your roof your rules as to whether the sex is gratuitous i personally found this weeks episode a bit over the top for plot and character reasons which i wont go into i think the scenes with theon and stannismel made sense but i thought the voyeuristic element of littlefingers brothel scene was a bit gross and unnecessary given they had hit their ta quortient for the episode with the other two scenes it wont stop me watching but i hope they reign it in a bit over the rest of the series on the swearing  im ok with this its a programme for adults and its depicting a pretty ghastly society "

"28" "badger1969" 2012-04-11 " i wonder if they left aeron damphair out now because they wouldnt want to cast the character now for a few scenes  then have him do nothing for several seasons better to wait  cast the rest of the greyjoys when they become more central to the plot "
"29" "BlueCalx" 2012-04-11 " i am certainly not a prude by any means and i know that drama has to reflect real life to a certain extent i think weve all come to expect brief nudity in a film and the odd swear word im nude at least twice a day and swear like a motherchuffer brief nudity and the odd swear word would hardly be reflective of my real life and nor would it be reflective of a world with no law and very little order filled with characters in desperation and difficult circumstances it wouldnt be reflective of a time of warfare and terror and cruelty and it wouldnt be reflective of a feudal society in which the weak are routinely exploited by the strong yes got has some choice language and even choicer tits but i think youre on shaky ground arguing that it is unnecessary it is entirely reflective of the world it depicts and therefore consistent with your criteria "

"31" "funkymotherpucker" 2012-04-11 " agreed i think his duke of norfolk in elizabeth would have been a good model for a portrayal of stannis all scowling and rigid eccelstone would have been great even though he is the same age as mark addy robert maybe he is just a little too northern though and people would have thought he was a stark instead our friends in the north indeed "
"32" "badger1969" 2012-04-11 " i assume that the brothel exists largely in order to give more meat to littlefingers character by allowing him more of his own scenes in the books you only get to see him from the viewpoint of others not sure about the scene with ros i guess it showed the steel behind his seemingly friendly facade well enough "

"36" "Brownly" 2012-04-11 " im not convinced about stannis and melisandres hump scene not because i dont think it happened  i was convinced it did but because stannis kind of lost himself a bit and i dont think stannis is capable of losing himself yeah but his missus is an invalid of some sorts i gather this differs from the book  the implication being hes not been getting any makes him more ersusceptible in addition it also makes plain melisandres witchy power over him  no exposition necessary "
"37" "clarebelz" 2012-04-11 " sorry to say this and ill probably get a telling off which i completely understand but i find the bad language and the sex scenes over the top for such a drama and it really spoiled it for me the drama as a whole has a great storyline enough to capture an audience without such scenes i also worry that kids could be watching this likely they are and if mine were still at home they certainly wouldnt be i watch it with a neighbour as i dont have sky now and shes pretty broadminded but she was disgusted herself and also mentioned the fact that children could have access to this as well if this series was a film it would be an 18 certificate yet many kids have access to this in their bedrooms along with all the freeview soft porn channels that i have for years been saying should not be accessible without a pin but im only just noticing articles about this fact in the newspaper i am certainly not a prude by any means and i know that drama has to reflect real life to a certain extent i think weve all come to expect brief nudity in a film and the odd swear word but some of the scenes were like soft porn and the way the bad language was used was very offensive im not another mary whitehouse but i think the way they use the language and sex scenes shows that it is there for shock value and nothing else where do dramas go on from this next then if this sets the standard now then im out im afraid and i think that there will be many people who think like that its a real shame because apart from the offensive content the screenplay acting and direction was superb "
"38" "5432Hun" 2012-04-11 " there was an internet rumour about butler playing stannis last year always seemed a bit unlikely to me because he is a leading man of sorts and too good looking christopher eccelstone is stannis in my head his gaunt face would have been perfect for stannis look of barely suppresed fury "

"44" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-04-11 " im not sure whether gillen doesnt have the measure of his character or if the problem lies with the script but at the moment littlefinger seems to do far too much telling and not enough showing to the detriment of his storylines he does seem to be overused for exposition the worst example being that scene in series one where he was instructing ros and another girl like you i am not sure if its gillen or the script but i do feel his delivery of exposition can be a bit glib "
"45" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-04-11 " i agree that its about charismapersonality rather than physical attractiveness however im not persuaded in either department the character that i took from the books is fiery and mocking but yara came across as lumpen and gloating "

"169" "monders" 2012-04-10 " corking episode and it covered a lot a few brain burps from me salladhor saan was excellent i always imagined him as a barrel chested white haired type the casting completely threw me but makes so much sense well done to the casting folks again balon again absolutely nailed it the motherfucker has got some crazy assed eyes direwolves they look pretty good with simple camera trickery and relatively unobtrusive cgi elements my only gripe about them is just when did they grow so big s2 carries on directly from s1 doesnt it with maybe a few weeks gone in westeros anyway thats bytheby theyre mint and i want one littlefinger didnt notice his accent last and it really stood out this week odd indeed as last series he sounded spot on "
"170" "SmartyMcFly" 2012-04-10 " firstly i think some of the comments from book readers of which i am one are giving too much away  unintentionally  but nevertheless upcoming details and the ways particular characters evolve are being dropped into posts if i hadnt read the books i wouldnt read or post here anymore i was a bit disappointed in this episode mainly for all the reasons that people have already highlighted i can make a pretty good guess as to why ros is being developed in a certain way and she is now being given an axe to grind against littlefinger hes being shown to have a cruel and nasty streak that is counter to the charm that he exhibits in court he is certainly less aloof than i imagined him i wonder whether littlefingers arc will be one of those that changes the most from the books in which case i will feel a little let down  although maybe some of the subtleties needed to be exaggerated for tv when set against such a densely plotted and nuanced show ill bow to dds undeniable talent and sit on my hands for a bit longer before throwing a complete strop over petyrs portrayal my other main criticism is the quick scene switching my other half was more confused in this episode than any since the first 2 the best scene was the shae tyrion varys one  the subtle threats tyrions response and the i know how the game is played worked really well conleth hill is another of the actors that has quietly brought one of the sometimes rather sterile ahem characters in the book to life "

"172" "MJ1972" 2012-04-10 " but for someone whos already delivering lines in their secondthird language i dont think its that easy especially if they were taught american accents when starting out  as i suppose most unfortunately are i cant speak for denmark but in the netherlands most school kids are taught the queens english unfortunately 70 per cent of the tv shows broadcast on dutch tv are american which kind of muddles things i suppose carice van houten could somewhat ham up her foreign accent to make it more obvious that shes foreign unfortunately that is incredibly hard for actors when theyre not delivering lines in their native language speaking a foreign language when acting is one thing but actually hamming up a fake accent in what is effectively a fake accent to begin with is near impossible even for a gifted linguist "
"173" "TheSub" 2012-04-10 " to me littlefinger was all ron burgundy in the brothel scene but yeah youre quite right about the lannisters cerseis accent sounds quite convincing for obvious reasons i think dinklage as tyrion is doing quite well with his  showing that he is noble born and educated and the actor is american so its not easy for him i suppose jaime also known as lars ulrich sounds american half of the time and danish the other half which is disappointing and then theres melisandre who sounds dutch having said that one should ask what kind of direction they get in terms of their accents are they told to do some kind of brit accent or received pronunciation or what for most british actors the switch between their nativeregional accent and received pronunciation is almost natural because they have to do it so often but for someone whos already delivering lines in their secondthird language i dont think its that easy especially if they were taught american accents when starting out  as i suppose most unfortunately are "
"174" "MJ1972" 2012-04-10 " i really liked this episode my one complaint which others have made as well is that were moving between stories at breakneck speed although this episode was a vast improvement over the season opener in this regard we actually got to spend a fair bit of time with tyrion and theon in this episode which was time well spent i also loved the aryaandgendry stuff i cant wait to see more of hot pie hes perfect littlefinger doesnt bother me too much yes theyre overplaying the brothelowner card and yes hes a lot more obvious than he is in the books however i found his scene with ros genuinely chilling it gave me goosebumps i thought he delivered his monologue very well give or take a few accent slips i like yara too she might be smirky but she strikes me as a charismatic leader i look forward to seeing more of her "
"175" "MJ1972" 2012-04-10 " so is melisandre supposed to sound foreign she is an asshai priestess after all in which case her dutchpronunciation of some of the english is fine or is carice van houten simply struggling with her accent i think theres a little bit of both going on van houtens english accent clearly isnt as convincing as it could be but to me its acceptable because she is a foreign character i just wish the makers of the show would emphasise that fact a little more they could do a much better job of showing how alien melisandre is and how she is really an outsider to stannis court although she is clearly a major player at that court i hope well be given a bit more cultural background for melisandre in the upcoming episodes as well as a better sense of melisandres outsider status once those things have been taken care of van houtens accent probably wont bother me any more "
"176" "TheSub" 2012-04-10 " i agree with you on the littlefinger brothel scene his accent has gone all weird unfortunately he kept reminding me of will ferrells ron burgundy  a reminder i really dont want when watching game of thrones "
"177" "candylilacs" 2012-04-10 " in the book shes not described as beautiful in fact she is said to be striking but had too many flaws to be considered beautiful that however didnt stop men from being attracted to her  including her brother of course "
"178" "TheSub" 2012-04-10 " my thoughts tyrion i like him after every episode i like him even more in terms of dramatic performance peter dinklage is definitely the highlight of this show for me his final scene with his sister was well placed i thought to remind us what kind of position he has within his family jon snow i dont know whether i share your fondness for jon snow since series one ive been thinking that hes been a bit of a whiny bastard i mean i figured out early that he was actually a bastard but it didnt take long for the whiny bit to start i still dont care too much for him at this point theon greyjoy it was good to see him put in his place by his father hopefully he doesnt off himself because he unknowingly fondled his sisters breast and had his hand down her knickers littlefinger i have to agree with you on aidan gillens performance its not on par with his performance in series one the scene in episode one of the current series between littlefinger and cersei was quite good i thought mostly because it showed us how vulnerable even the clever lord baelish is however this time around hes lost his cold and calculated cleverness whats more his accent seems to be failing last night while he was doing his scene in the brothel i was constantly thinking of will ferrells ron burgundy he even looks the part and thats not something you want a character in game of thrones to remind you of we can only hope he improves his game of thrones couldnt help myself stannis and melisandre i dont know whether its supposed to be like that but stannis comes across as rather the idiot to me good acting as he does succeed in reminding me of his brother robert somehow im not too fond of melisandre i mean is she a dutch priestess she sounds like one the accents sometimes confuse me mostly they make sense in relation to the geography if you assume westeros is a fantasy version of the british isles but sometimes i think theyre either not sure what to do with the accents of foreigners our mediterranean friend syrio forel being the main example so is melisandre supposed to sound foreign she is an asshai priestess after all in which case her dutchpronunciation of some of the english is fine or is carice van houten simply struggling with her accent cuts between scenes not too bad though i really wish some more would actually happen besides talking and shagging which sometimes happens simultaneously its not the only way to advance the plot after all "
"179" "SarahHughes" 2012-04-10 " meant to add for example with stannis and melisandre  i get it could be seen as a shockingsurprising scene to book readers but im more interested in what it says about melisandre  is she really a sorceress does she have an ulterior motive or is it more straightforward than that and yes i do think these topics can be discuss without book references after all this show is clearly going to deviate from the source material in some ways "
"180" "SarahHughes" 2012-04-10 " ok everyone i really dont want to have to say this every week but please can we try and avoid book spoilers i know only too well how addictive the books are to discuss and there are plenty of places out there to discuss them this is a tv blog for the show and i really want to discuss the show in its own right i know thats hard at times but we managed for the most part last season so "
"181" "SarahHughes" 2012-04-10 " completely agree with you about sam  the actor is doing a great job in a few scenes i think the supporting roles are often what makes this show actually which is why i also loved the scene with salladhor saan and davos and the brief glimpse of dolorous edd in week one "

"202" "BlueCalx" 2012-04-09 " re the incest this would actually be historically accurate if we take westeros as broadly representative of feudal western europe around the fourteenthfifteenth century the aristocracy would certainly have intermarried for bloodline reasons while regular casual incest would have been extremely common among the poorer classes incest was actually fairly common among the very poorest until the midtwentieth century slum clearances it was the simple combination of proximity and lack of opportunity for exogamy "

"229" "GrayArea" 2012-04-09 " im pleased the post was removed im usually against that sort of thing on other pieces  for reasons of offence and suchlike here i think its fine i think the thing with spoilers is that some spoilers spoil more than others so to speak and that post was in danger of a pretty egregious spoiling spoiler "
"230" "singist" 2012-04-09 " that was my reaction to a post that has subsequently been removed it was full of book spoilers major ones as it says in the opening to this blog for the purposes of this blog we are also going to hopefully avoid book spoilers as well when book talk starts up its usually about 23 posts deep before someone sicks up a spoiler maybe its involuntary i dunno but its pretty tiresome "
"231" "funkymotherpucker" 2012-04-09 " thats quite unfair as obviously the books will inevitably be discussed the writer is collaborating on the scripts and the story of the books havent completed yet "
"232" "sunnyone" 2012-04-09 " thanks for the heads up pixieonsolent looking forward to it immensely "
"233" "singist" 2012-04-09 " blah blah the books blah blah congratulations you can read impressive this is a tv series blog you know for the tv show i believe it states that quite clearly in the title heading if you want to talk about the books go here httpwwwwesterosorg or here httpwwwdragonmountcomforumstopic57074grrmasongoffireicebookdiscussionthread please thank you youre welcome "
"234" "pixieonsolent" 2012-04-09 " saw headhunters last sunday absolutely fantastic very bloody so as youre a got fan you wont be shocked lots of sly humour in it too definitely recommend it "
"235" "singist" 2012-04-09 " dude do you understand the meaning of spoiler or are you a troll "
"236" "ScotiaNova" 2012-04-09 " i think youre directing your book spoilers to the wrong person    "
"237" "Mirthin" 2012-04-09 " scotianova the problem with feast of crows is that it focused on some of the books less compelling characters and most of the storylines either went nowhere or went somewhere we didnt want to go most of the storylines told in that feast could be summed up in about 3 sentences and there were few revelations to be made it was however cerseis moment to in the sun her story dominated the book and i thought her story was very interesting i think if a dance with dragons had come out soon after feast as originally intended we probably wouldnt mind feast so much but it was a bitter pill to wait 5 years just for the halfbook that was feast and then another 8 years for its hamstrung partner "
"238" "Sinequanone" 2012-04-09 " yes please avoid spoilers for those of us who have not read the books and are choosing instead to follow the tv series "

"243" "singist" 2012-04-09 " agreed theres way too much story to get through to mess about i like that theyve fleshed these allusions out theyve done a good job and besides was there really any doubt that stan and mel shagged not in my mind at any rate "
"244" "childonfire" 2012-04-09 " i really want to read the books before i watch this my mate says the books are somewhat shoddily written but he doesnt always have good judgment about these things i will play the devils advocate and agree with your mate if you are planning on reading all five you will definitely have rr martin fatigue by the end of your endeavor i prefer the tv series as i think the script writers do wonders with stodgy prose but great story lines the dialogue is that much more snappy the pace all the more enticing "
"245" "thoughtandmemory" 2012-04-09 " as far as the whole stannismelisandre revelation goes i dont know why its so surprising or seen to be such a deviation  arent there a few hints about it in the later books it seems a bit like the revelation about renly and loras the knight of flowers in the first series loads of people said it was a deviation from the books but really it was all there between the lines all that the tv writers seem to be doing is making stuff like that more explicit "
"246" "Sinequanone" 2012-04-09 " i like yara like the fact that the actress is not conventionally beautiful to understand what is going on i have had to look things up on a wiki  that stannis is on some islands not his choice  he was sent there by robert b and that renly is on the mainland with the bigger armies we really should have had some more of renly so far "
"247" "sharpeiboy" 2012-04-09 " just a bit disappointed at the sight or nonsight of dragonstone especially since theyve got it so right with casa greyjoy or winterfell my imagination sees dragonstone as being huge  covered with gargoyles otherwise why did stannis choose it as his base its not exactly in the centre ofthe action being stuck in the ocean miles away from the mainland the cgi people could have excelled in this i thought littlefinger had a lot of brothels it seems he spends an awful amount of time in this one particular one im not criticising just going by the last couple of episodes asha why the f yara yes ive read why but is spoton unlike the coupling between stannis  melisandre which swerved into hollywood cliche just a bit too much "

"251" "MissGlenghis" 2012-04-09 " the books are very well written martins style is consistent and unobtrusive while setting telling tones he does do the yeah my lord for to whit and woo stuff a little but he also does it consistently what i admire about him is the way that each section theyre divided into the personalities whose viewpoint they are writing from provides thoughts consistently from that viewpoint although it does get a bit use a hammer to do the job of a chisel when he is dealing with women as unreliable narrators later on "
"252" "Phillyguy" 2012-04-09 " got seems to be playing up littlefinger as a pimp a bit too much it wasnt as important in the book iirc i guess any excuse to show some nudity "
"253" "MissGlenghis" 2012-04-09 " i suspect what you might be picking up is the fact that the secretive and manipulative littlefinger is actually a character that does a lot of telling and very little showing those around him get taken in by the telling but the script is possibly trying to foreshadow a reveal as an unreliable narrator or something "
"254" "MoreTears" 2012-04-09 " i disagree with your sentiments on the matter the producers say they are not adapting book by book they are adapting a song of ice and fire as a whole using the title of the first book in place of the more unwieldy title of the full story and the fact that the first season approximately covered the first book in the story does not establish a pattern for what is to come the contents of the third book are probably going to play out over two different seasons and after that there will be overlapping of material from different books in the same season "
"255" "GrayArea" 2012-04-09 " does anyone have any advice id advise you to read them i dont think theyre shoddily written some complain loudly about the last two but i enjoyed them honestly though give the first one a try if youre anything like me it wont take you long  i found them to be real pageturners "
"256" "BenjyUK" 2012-04-09 " the books are brilliant your mate is probably dismayed by the sometimes excessive detail martin goes into for feasts etc but theyre so epic having said that you might be a little disappointed by some of the characters in the book in comparison to the tv series no names "
"257" "BenjyUK" 2012-04-09 " this series is going to incorporate some of book 34 though im led to believe it would have to be called a clash of swords and crows or something "

"261" "HonestIago" 2012-04-09 " head in a bag  i understand the actor became unavailable so this probably arises from this thats a shame because he was really great one slight worry why isnt the horse followed back also makes sense to get rid of some people from an already enormous cast i like aggo rakharo and kovarro but they dont actually do anything apart from beat up those who attack daenerys and she already has jorah to do that "
"262" "JamesWMoar" 2012-04-09 " ha thats so stupid especially when we have robb stark  robert baratheon and jon snow  jon arryn as well as tywin  tyrion they changed robert arryn the boy whos not been weaned yet to robin arryn last season as well "
"263" "HonestIago" 2012-04-09 " agreed there was little point in littlefingers scene in the brothel  theres little point in ros at all  so that seemed utterly wasted i hope theyre not using ros to replace chataya as the main reason for chataya was she wasnt one of littlefingers conleth hill is superb as varys  the sparring between him and tyrion was wonderful i loved the scenes on pyke  asha is one of my favourite characters  and like you sam i get all geekily excited when i see new places crop up on the titles they seemed to be hinting that asha was the commander of the iron fleet and i hope that doesnt mean victarion is a gonner i like victarion and he plays a major role later is anyone else looking for clues for the final books in who gets kept in the series martin has told benioff and weiss roughly how he intends to end the series just in case and theyll know who they need and who they dont "
"264" "BenjyUK" 2012-04-09 " thanks i read through and saw that i can accept it but i actually agree with a previous comment that yara sounds more like arya than asha ever did with osha "

"267" "BenjyUK" 2012-04-09 " who is this yara why is she not asha and what was that bizarre plot deviation right at the end you know the one that never even came close to happening in the book not that im complaining i was just shocked into falling off my chair almost i hope they can keep the davos and theon scenes as entertaining as they currently are i got a bit bored of them whilst reading theon especially was justflat i disagree on littlefinger though whilst he is clearly not as subtle on the screen as he was made out in the novels i do think this was necessary to try and convey his character to the majority and i dont really feel like it makes him any weaker "
"268" "GrayArea" 2012-04-09 " balon greyjoy  superb really great and made a much greater impact on me than i remember from the books he is a mad old sod though yara asha  honestly i think its too soon to judge quite a lot of smirking going on and i would have enjoyed a bit more verbal sparring she seemed a bit smug in the scene with baron which isnt quite how i think of her i shall withhold judgement until i see how she handles an axe also looks are neither here nor there though i think shes striking which is much much better than model beautiful that would be daft unfortunate captains daughter  agree about the actress being brave i thought that was a really painful scene to watch for the right reasons i also think its the most justifiable sex scene thus far it shows both theons character and the general gender imbalance in westeros  certainly much more convincingly than any brothel scenes ghost  i love the dire wolves theyre huge and the look amazing top cgi work gilly  perfect samwell  that guy can really act so much with just a lookshrug fantastic stuff stannis  hmmm getting a little worried now last week he was perfect i thought but giving in to lustpromise of a son just doesnt sit right i know its implied that something like this happened in the books but i will need a good dose of stern iron stannis next week to make up for this mel  not sure the nudity was needed but she retains mystique all the same aryahotpiegendry  every moment a joy best scenes this season for me tyrion  though tyrion is as ever masterfully played bronn  hurrah looks like well be getting extra bronn which is excellent news cersei  continues to impress scene with tyrion crackled with tension littlefinger  he is a bit of a perve in the books so thats fine i guess i think the being scary to ros scenes or something like them are needed for none readers otherwise later ahem revelations are just going to seemsurprising to say the least but what the heck is going on with his accent davos  perfect i knew he would be saan  its odd i never had a fixed mental image of him from the books that happens to me sometimes so since the actor did such a great job i shall simply picture him it works fine place of origin can be shiftedmade mysterious i dont think it matters at all varys  still paddling away masterful and excellent spot bunkster yoren  yeah i wouldnt mess with him either pyke  looks perfect old guy on the peer  finally i must applaud this actor just pitchperfect representation of theons distance from his own people "
"269" "edinamikie" 2012-04-09 " also loved the single finger on the door scene with the literal gesture of varys having a higher reach and therefore demonstrating his superior omnipotence davos is also my favourite character in the books and very much looking forward to more of him in future episodes "
"270" "Bunkster" 2012-04-09 " 2 small things that i loved when davos and saan are walking on the beach look at the shape of the island in the background its shaped like a dragon and looks cool as fuck as vayrs goes to leave the tower of the hand tyrion puts his hand against the door to stop him opening itbut when tyrion goes to open it varys puts 1 finger against the door to stop him just thought that was a lovely touch to show that vayrs thinks he is strongermore powerful than tyrion "
"271" "edinamikie" 2012-04-09 " loved series one without reading any of the books but now that ive read the books im finding series 2 a bit confusing even though er series 1 in hindsight was more or less like the first book i think i just need to block all the books from memory and enjoy this as a totally seperate entity which it eris incidentally hbo have a preview of things to come in later episodes and every snippet looks more exciting than everything thats happened in the first two episodes i suppose thats what previews are for god i sound really stupid "
"272" "funkymotherpucker" 2012-04-09 " yeah thats what i thought especially with a feast of crows and a dance with dragons taking place simultaneously as well back to the episode at hand could any of our american compadres reveal what dany was saying in dothraki my ahem source for episode 2 did not contain the subtitles "
"273" "funkymotherpucker" 2012-04-09 " ha thats so stupid especially when we have robb stark  robert baratheon and jon snow  jon arryn as well as tywin  tyrion "
"274" "ScotiaNova" 2012-04-09 " funkymotherpucker 9 april 2012 1257pm in the case of the volume now in hand the reader should realise that the opening chapters of a storm of swords do not follow the closing chapters of a clash of kings so much as overlap them ill leave it there to save spoilers but it does give the writers the license to use material from the a storm of swords not sure if they will but there is a heck of a lot to fit in the writers have already stated not to expect 1 book  1 seasonthey are adapting it as one long story and will introduce season breaks were appropriate    they already put some scenes from book 2 into the first season    cats talk with jaime    the night watch setting out    there is a character who for spoilers sake shall remain nameless who does nothing in book 2 but has been given material brought forwards from book 3 maybes to keep them on screen this season    "
"275" "Cariad007" 2012-04-09 " the producers thought it would be too confusing to have a character called asha when theres also a character called osha as the two names sound very similar so they changed it to yara which of course sounds nothing like arya "
"276" "funkymotherpucker" 2012-04-09 " changed ashas name to yara "
"277" "funkymotherpucker" 2012-04-09 " any reason on why they change ashas name to yara seems a bit strange that one i enjoyed the episode but am worried that the story threads are being sped along too quickly ideally youd want the series to be 20 episodes long just read the synopsis for clash of kings and cant believe how much else they have to squeeze into 8 episodes also the beginning of a storm of swords has this a song of ice and fire is told through the eyes of characters who are sometimes hundreds or even thousands of miles apart from one another some chapters cover a day some only an hour others might span a fortnight a month half a year with such a structure the narrative cannot be strictly sequential sometimes important things are happening simultaneously a thousand leagues apart in the case of the volume now in hand the reader should realise that the opening chapters of a storm of swords do not follow the closing chapters of a clash of kings so much as overlap them ill leave it there to save spoilers but it does give the writers the license to use material from the a storm of swords not sure if they will but there is a heck of a lot to fit in "

"280" "Mattox" 2012-04-09 " aidan gillen has proved to be quite capable of doing littlefinger so far  the sparring match between him and varys in the last series was one of my highlights its not really a problem with the actor but the fact that his scene was entirely superfluous the great thing about littlefinger is that less is more  you dont see what is going on and are left guessing as to his motives by letting us in to see his day to day the show is taking the mystery and intrigue away they are doing it right for varys and should follow suit with baelish "
"281" "Daviewonder" 2012-04-09 " blog up after the uk showing please no one on here cant wait one more day as for the show i thought some of the sex scenes were a little voyeuristic aside from that i still miss sean bean as ned stark he was the centre of the show for me and every character revolved around him with his death i feel as if the show is still missing its most important axis still its building nicely towards an excellent series once all the new characters have settled in "
"282" "SarahHughes" 2012-04-09 " i agree the actress playing the captains daughter was very brave and i loved your description of the casting call i dont agree however with ashayara  i think the actress did a pretty good job of suggesting her charisma and a certain type of sex appeal  as i mentioned i think the scene would have been better if it had been longer we lost the impact of theons shock because we didnt really get the build up to it "

"285" "MsBlancheHudson" 2012-04-09 " tyrion is always the showstopper for me  love him to bits littlefinger seems to be morphing into an al swerengen with much nicer manners and i quite agree he should be more nuanced to stay true to the books i sometimes wonder if his appearances are there just to up the bosom quota hes not really advancing his storyline much at the moment havent been overly excited by the first two episodes of the new season but clearly there is a set up going on and much ahead bring it on "
"286" "candylilacs" 2012-04-09 " well id trade all the brothel scenes for more of daenarys gendryarya or pretty much any of the real story the brothel just exists to show gratuitous sex and naked women so less of that and more of the story please yeah i know hbo probably has a clause in the contract for that but its really getting silly now that we get to watch what random customers are doing as they spy through keyholes as for littlefinger i always hated the actor playing him so onenote and monotone act damn it "
"287" "CharlieBronze" 2012-04-09 " great scene between tyrion and cersei what a bitch and yet its possible to empathise with her hatred for tyrion because his birth killed her mother was craster offering his sons to the white walkers its amazing how little they have featured throughout the show so far especially after the power of the very first scene of this show and it was that scene that got me hooked come for the supernatural killing machines stay for the political intrigue wit tits and carnage "

"308" "SiccarPoint" 2012-04-09 " good episode ive found these first two episodes to have been much tighter than some of last season  less exposition more stuff ive also enjoyed that some of the characters that felt a bit flat in the books oh god another davos chapter have really fleshed out on the screen davos stannis hopefully the ironmen as sarah notes though im wondering that as the storylines thicken up and spread out if the nonbookreading viewer is going to be able to stay on top of whats going on i got disorientated a few times and im already familiar with the plot this is only going to get worse too would be interested to know if justtv viewers stayed with it also apologies if i have managed to break some kind of unofficial preuk showing boycott sorry guys "
