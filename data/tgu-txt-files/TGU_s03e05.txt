"24" "Azrael59" 2013-05-04 " zbzdhbafr  theres another point you need to keep in mind  it isnt made as clear in the tv series as in the books except in the 1st season but its still central to the characters  the previous war was long enough ago that robert and ned both older than jamie were teenagers when it started the book clarifies jamie was only 15 when he killed the king but even the tv series makes it pretty clear that he couldnt have been more than a teenager at the time as a guide note that robb and jon were born at the very end of the war  subtract their current age from jamies and its clear that whilst they may have bumped the characters ages up slightly to match the actors he still would have been a teenager plus its fairly clear that he never chose to join the kings guard in the first place  he was to be the lannister heir and its clear from tywins argument with tyrion two episodes ago that jamie was chosen against the familys wishes he pretty much had to join the guard because you couldnt say no to a king that burnt people alive on a whim tie that back to his conversation with catelyn about his disdain for taking oaths seriously when says hes had to make so many oaths that they end up contradicting each other basically you had a young teenager who remained in his position as kings guard even after his own father changed sides because he was young and naive enough to think that oaths and honour meant everything a point that ned overlooks because he wrongly assumes that jamie had switched sides with the rest of the lannisters and was just waiting for a convenient time to strike then he gets put in a situation where he either has to allow the city to burn with everyone still in it and fight his own father or break his oath  the only time hes ever actually been a hero and hes been mocked for it ever since again note that this is happening when the character is 15  he didnt get to choose his side any more than ned and rob could choose theirs which daenerys in turn overlooks in viewing ned and robert as traitors  her father had demanded that the then teenage ned and robert be executed for an imagined treason prompting their adopted carer jon arryn to rebel with ned and robert having no choice but to join the rebellion when they were old enough the idea of good characters seeing the worst in others because they dontcant know the full situation is one of the series recurring themes which in turn goes back to explaining why at the start of the booksseries jamie couldnt care less about honour or reputation and when daenerys presumably reaches westeros with an invading army viewing all who oppose her as traitors the cycle will continue "

"44" "OldModernist" 2013-05-02 " jaime lannister increasingly becomes the most interesting character as the series goes on and what he did to bran was terrible it was something done in the spur of of the moment and done to protect him cersei and their children who would undoubtedly suffered terribly if their affair had come to life while this is certainly true jaime tells his side of the story but the reality is that people hate him not just for killing the king but because as ned start told him you served the king well when serving was safe everyone served the king when serving was safe robert baratheon rebelled because of what happened to his fiancé eddark stark rebelled because of what happened to his father and brother not one of them rebelled on principle but because of things that had happened to them while the mad king killed people who werent related to them they didnt do anything about it "
"45" "davidjones2492" 2013-05-02 " cosmonaut  its not the lannisters though its the crown that its in massive debt and struggling to pay for the wedding ironically the biggest debtor is tywin lannister who has been lending money to littlefinger for years the lannisters remain the wealthiest family in westeros however they now lack the military power they could call on before due to the fact that rob stark has destroyed two of the three armies they raised for the war in the riverlands it from a military perspective they really depend on the tyrells i dont know whether this was in the show but in the book tyrion asks whether his father would consider forgiving the crowns debt seeing as joffrey is his grandson and tywin basically tells him where to go "

"574" "guardiansek" 2013-04-30 " i think that this was my favorite episode so far this season 1 jaime showing some actual depth instead of snarking his way through every conversation i have a hard time believing that he kept his secret about his motivations in killing the mad king for so long though i would have thought that postrebellion it would have been a simple thing to share his story and point out all the caches of wildfire waiting to be set off around kings landing still nice acting and character development and jaime could use a touch of humility 2 arya having several great scenes all centered around themes of loss maisie williams has been the best new acting talent to emerge out of game of thrones 3 i guess that it is time to say goodbye to gendry a small but great farewell scene between him and arya he wasnt a standout character but its been almost two seasons that he has been around in his small way i doubt we will see a storyline following him thoros and beric in their attempt to survive and revenge the collateral damaging of the riverlands i doubt that if there was that storyline there would be a happy ending to it 4 robb seems almost gleeful about getting the freys back onboard after breaking his marital pact with them personally i think dread would be a better instinct my understanding is that the books portrayed his decision to execute karstark as a way to preserve the wellbeing of sansa and arya in lannister custody this episode should have pointed that out as well 5 ah tywin lannisterits a good thing that you are so selfassured that you wont mind it if fathers day comes and goes without a card or two from your children he saddles tyrion with a loveless and morally unappealing marriage but he saves his real screwover for the momentarily gloating cersei she gets demoted from queen to surrogate mother in another loveless marriage with another guy who is interested in someone elsemale someone elses in this case and if it goes through she is probably packed off to highgarden and away from her precious center of power shes so loathsome that watching her father treat her like a breeding chamber is a joy to behold 6 watching jorah and barristans prickly relationship is like watching highlander in the end you know there can be only one 7 the only downside to this episode and season is that sansa continues to plumb new depths of obliviousness and callowness her character was never very intelligent but she seems to be regressing in that department instead of developing "

"579" "Musa1" 2013-04-30 " so what did you think can robb take casterly rock and save the day or is tywin right that hes running out of time did jaimes story change your mind about him or does his defenestration of bran place him beyond the pale for ever most importantly is there a statute of limitations on the amount of times thoros can bring beric back to life or can he continue for eternity judging by the author rr martin he will likely twist the story to lead to more dispair and suffering hence the dragons will kill the lot of them i dont see the army of unsullied remaining totally obedient and beholden to the blonde queen "

"600" "ACertainBang" 2013-04-30 " another storming episode nothing felt superfluous unlike bran and theon sorry sarah last week was great to see the westerosi version of a light sabre in action against the hound certainly gave deric the edge to begin with he should probably choose a sword with a higher melting point in future though and i did enjoy olenna calling tyrion out on being a browbeaten bookworm we love debauched tyrion too hope he rebels against tywins wishes and returns to his carefree crowd pleasing ways "

"603" "seeknsanity" 2013-04-30 " what i love about grrms characters is the lovehate or hatelove relationship he builds for practically each character jaime not only trying to kill bran during the first episode but his subsequent sending someone to finish the job doesnt make him redeemable however this scene where he reveals his motives behind the kingslayer act is a major step towards redemption arya i simply want to take home she is such a great little actress she should be nominated for an oscar tyrion seems to met his match well the lannisters really because i believe lady olenna can run circles around cersei and she is different in that she understands that you cannot ignore the people of the city she is teaching mageary well she is also showing how not to be run over by those who would presume to hold power and would definitely take kindness and dullwit for granted i like that they added more of her in scene robb robb robb no one listens to reason there i thought he had a strategic mind and some cunning he was already working with a considerably lesser army than tywins why alienate half of them granted karstark was openly defying him again this is the same one that greywind was going to bite during that feast right he needed to be handled but i had hoped it wouldnt be a public beheading but a scene where robb says in his face and close whisper no we will deal with this after we have won the warmenacing like alas if everyone wasnt flying by the seat of their pants it might not be such an interesting series "
"604" "NewTech_News" 2013-04-30 " did jaimes story change your mind about him or does his defenestration of bran place him beyond the pale for ever jamie did the right thing in pushing bran as it would of been for the greater good jaimes attempted murder was awful but he probably did it to save the lives of his sisterlover two nephewssons and niecedaughter would you kill an innocent boy to save 3 innocent children of your own family joffrey being a class a turd at that point doesnt stop him from being innocent he was probably also aware that his and cersei secret would of started a war costing the lives of thousands more young boys obviously he couldnt see one was coming anyway so one boys life to save thousands and save the people you love the most hard for jamie not to push bran the greater good and all that "
"605" "seeknsanity" 2013-04-30 " deletethispost  i agree maisie deserves an oscar for that scene where she snatched up the knife and was going after dog only to be snatched up by one of the brotherhood the level of frustration in that childs voice then the tender moments afterwards where she just wants her father back powerful but oh i agree with sarah this show seems to find some wonderful child actors bran arya and now shireen wonderful casting "

"615" "kged" 2013-04-30 " dotmegsam  this was another one of those episodes where little things happen which have immense power lady catelyn sitting in the background as the two young lannisters were laid out silent and slightly hunched in on herself clearly lost in thoughts of her own boys it was heartrending such bottomless grief and clungto dignity with little attention drawn to it by the camera or the script exceptional stuff also unrelated roose bolton is a thoroughly horrible man that just needs putting on the record "
"616" "Ryan Brighton" 2013-04-30 " crooky  theyve definitely humanised him a bit i thought he was about the best candidate for king after reading the books so im biased in his favour it also seemed to me it was selyse buying what melisandre was selling and stannisnot being totally convincedam a bit bemused by the tv melisandre in the books shes a religous fanatic rather than an outright femme fatale when cressen tried to poison her she makes it clear she knows and gives him the chance to spill the cup and is said to have pity in her eyes when he dies here shes all dark looks under the eyelashes and sultryness which though attractive isnt how i see her "
"617" "Ryan Brighton" 2013-04-30 " candylilacs  i know the whole selling poachers to slavers and doing a runner before ned stark got hold of him but his actions after that include taking roberts coin to off the targaryens and not doing it swearing his sword to viserys targaryen and betraying him and letting him die horribly and continuing to spy on dany long after swearing to her hes a pretty untrustworthy character in my opinon i think selmy isnt telling the truth when he says he wasnt involved in the small council and hes waiting to decide whether to tell or not "
"618" "CStars" 2013-04-30 " mroneill  good point on stannis he is a lost man and probably lonely with his thoughts it was interesting to see how shireen held true to her belief in davos something her father could not do she showed the will to defy her father at least in secret a huge contrast with the tywins children "
"619" "dotmegsam" 2013-04-30 " i really enjoyed the integrity of the series going right back to ned stark in episode 1 you condemn the man and you wield the sword yourself in retrospect the true heir of eddard was never going to make a different call mind see where scrupulous honour and honesty got his father another masterclass in character acting all round seeing the marvellous anton lesser in what looks like a tiny role just emphasises the strength of the casting "

"659" "MRONeill" 2013-04-29 " viviandarkbloom  i did not get the feeling that tyrion wanted to marry sansa just the opposite he was protesting that she was just a child  and that after having such a difficult go at life it simply wasnt fair that she would be forced to marry him one of the many many reasons tyrion is one of my favorite characters not to mention actors  he truly does have a good heart yes he wanted to inherent casterly rock as is his right but his first thought was for sansa not what he would acquire by marrying her "

"679" "rickylee369" 2013-04-29 " chaeimpi  is it possible that dany is annoying you because she doesnt fit exactly into the portrayal of the character in the books not everybody has read them so may not understand your point of view i love the show but will not read the novels until the final episode has aired often it can make a great show to a novice become a disappointment to the expert as the books are usually more detailed allowing you to experience the thoughts and emotions of the protagonists in a way actors cannot always convey and in the case of game of thrones vast and sprawling as it is include unseen incidental personalities you might find some of the plot or pacing jarring i look forward to the text version part one awaits on my bookshelf i would have hated though to visualise the story one way and then watch it unfold on the tv and be disappointed much better the other way round when i can picture the actors in an expanded format of course if this is not the reason please disregard all of the above "

"682" "Ryan Brighton" 2013-04-29 " jonstark  i must be one of the rarer ones who likes gillens version of littlefinger hes got the whole creepy uncle vibe down to a t takes a lot to make a spoton version of varys seem the more normal character "
"683" "ChaeImpi" 2013-04-29 " greenseer  fair point  except the dany on screen isnt feisty is she at least in the past few episodes as georges repeptitive phrasing has made you weary danys constantly stony face just really irritates me i think im not doing very well at putting my point across but what im trying to say is dany having this tough chick image doesnt work because of how emilia clarke is playing it out like i would have celebrated a little more when she unleased the awesomeness of drogon if she just had a little smirk on her face or something to show she was pleased a more charismatic dany not so guarded that she has no expression other than fierce aloofness perhaps some playful banter between her and missandei as often happened in the books just to show us that there is still a bit of the little girl left as her vulnerability is what made her rise to power all the more tantalising i didnt care very much for margery in the books as she displayed very little weakness shes rich in a secure position due to her powerful family calculating and clearly not in much danger from joffrey dany is nothing like that she knows her power is never certain for long because of all the crap she has been through so can a bit of that insecurity shine through just to make her a more sympathetic character "
"684" "singist" 2013-04-29 " idil  and on a more nerdish note i particularly like his score not only because he creates leitmotif or themes for the variousahemthemes but that in doing so he is creating a musical foreshadowing i think that is very clever "

"712" "ChaeImpi" 2013-04-29 " rickylee369  i dont disagree with what youre saying its just that her character develoment isnt shown quite so well in the series due to the way emilia portrays her interactions with hard men for example tell the westerosi whore to lower her eyes the slaver kraznys mo naklozcomplained to the slave girl who spoke for him i deal in meat not metalthe bronze is not for sale tell her to look at the soldiers even the dimpurple eyes of a sunset savage can see how magnificent my creatures aresurelykraznyss high valyrian was twisted and thickened by the characteristicgrowl of ghis and flavored here and there with words of slaver argot danyunderstood him well enough but she smiled and looked blankly at the slavegirl as if wondering what he might have said here she takes advantage of kraznys perception of her as a foolish girl which makes his surprise at her deception all the more enjoyable however that same scene in the series had dany looking cross with her nose up in the air it makes her look like a girl trying to be hard rather than one who uses her perceived vulnerability to outwit him i know i sound petty but do you see how her appearing a liitle less harsh all the time an occasional smile might actually display her maturity a bit better "
"713" "DiamondDag" 2013-04-29 " mroneill  a fantastic opener with the wonderful sword fight between beric and the hound  it was a refreshing change to actually see the action as opposed to the various battles that take place off scene beric had some killer moves and i must admit that i gasped when he lit his sword on fire also fully convinced that the casting for this character was a quality move theyve done a good job with this part of the story beric and thoros are great even for the smaller roles they keep finding actors of the same calibre as the main cast didnt hurt that the sword fight looked fantastic i agree with your points about a lot of the characters having some sort of flaw whether they are deemed good or bad people jaime isnt the only one who seems to contradict themselves the difficulty is in trying to avoid the clichés that this brings and not turning those people into boring antiheroes thankfully there are a few outandout villains that show us people like the hound and jaime arent really top of the bastard scale and there are still some genuinely good people kicking around i think itd be to the detriment of the show if everyone was grey you need some characters to cheer or hiss at "

"718" "rickylee369" 2013-04-29 " from the opening credits to the final curtain another quality episode i mention the theme tune because i noticed this week that if you dont watch game of thrones in tenhour long chunks as i did the first two seasons then it actually builds excitement towards what you are going to see not many shows do that these days i love the music its subtle yet strong and the map like clockwork forming citadels and castles tiny glimpses of new lands not yet discovered by the viewer anyway beyond the hound trial by combat is a familiar notion to anyone that has ever read a book or seen a film that was set before the victorian era but it never usually takes place between a mountain and an immortal of course the wretched manbeast with the burns was scared ever so slightly by the fiery sword but there was no doubting the final outcome until of course the very dark lord of light bought back his bannerman from the afterlife also in no doubt was the inevitable sexscene between the bastard snow and wild thing ygritte though i call her egret i never knew an egret and a crow would be sexually compatible but jon has a tender heart and gave the girl what shed been missing for too long a bath also bathing together were the surely about to shag brienne and kingslayer now this was serious stuff despite my flippancy having seen the golden haired arrogant sisterfiddler push bran from the window in practically his very first appearance it has been assumed that hes a disloyal monster in need of a shrink or at least cutting down to size well he may not be a foot shorter but he is a hand lighter and as it is the one that wields his mighty weapon he feels vulnerable enough now to lose the cloak of invincibility and confess the reason for the universal hatred directed at him he did what daddy told him and stabbed the mad king in the back because the mad king burn them all was mad wonder why i ever thought that would be a bad thing apart from the oathbreaking and no a cloak of invincibility is not a new weapon youve somehow missed anyway oathbreaking seemed to me to be the theme of the show my name is jaime had his story to tell jon snow broke his vows  the wall is a long way from his mind now weve got a little power struggle between the two traitors who now ride with the mother of dragons the notion that her most loyal servant the slaver will have to sacrifice his position to assist danyris claim to the iron throne is fascinating if the people will not accept him then he may end up with nothing even if she has the dragons and the ruthlessness of leadership dany has shown she would be no dictator the protoclone army of the unsullied freed yet proud to serve are proof of that im not sure i can see that story ending happily also being bad breaking oaths was lord karstark who murdered the blonde boys in the tower the king of the north not too happy hangs the lords men and quite coolly makes the lookout watch before his own neck snaps then in another echo of the first episode takes his fathers role on dispensing justice severing karstarks head upon rock i like to think sean bean for thats who it was not eddard stark would have done the same even if it had cost him half his allies although much has been stirring in the north kings landing has been pretty busy also sansa has annoyed baelish and looks like her reward will be a lifetime married to the most powerful halfling since frodo had the ring cersei has annoyed everyone and it looks like she will be marrying a homosexual diana rigg cant seem to annoy anyone despite having the bluntness of an old axe in the head  but when youve got three billion chicken fillets 8 million fillet steaks 652 barrels of wine gums and an eternal supply of figs keeping everyone fed through the long winter then people just put up with you i suppose figs being especially handy during a siege situation still with old man lannister forcing his selfish kids to marry for influence i can see more oaths being broken soon oh by the way tara fitzgerald keeps dead babies in jars stannis has a daughter who fell asleep on a sandwich toaster the armourer bastard son of baratheon is dumping arry  are we still calling himher that and if youre having problems with your dwarf whoring and drinking his way across the seven kingdoms get him a job at an accounting firm it will turn him into a browbeaten bookkeeper personally i preferred the pervert no joffrey this week probably firing bolts or blanks somewhere "

"732" "singist" 2013-04-29 " sydneysider28  i hope jaime gets to wash his face too that confession was long he could have cleansed exfoliated and moisturised whilst he was talking "
"733" "VivianDarkbloom" 2013-04-29 " mroneill  sansa is also a tougher role to play because shes quite a classic introvert in the books you have access to her thoughts but as shes a prisoner that doesnt translate into much freedom for her though as we saw in blackwater and the first episode of last season she takes chances to help people where she can "
"734" "Muppet_N2" 2013-04-29 " singist  oh robb stop taking after your dad too much honour does not go a long way in westeros have you learned nothing i would say honour when is more confortable to practice it he could have chopped his mothers head and nothing else would have happened or at least he could not married that chick "
"735" "VivianDarkbloom" 2013-04-29 " lennartr  you should read the books judging by this youd love them "
"736" "Muppet_N2" 2013-04-29 " diamonddag  i think what stood out for me this week was the differences between barristan selmy and jaime lannister we have barristan revered as a great man of both skill and honour who by his own admission is tired of serving bad kings but serve them he has keeping his oath and his honour along with the respect of those around him by doing his duty and barristan selmy saved the mad king while he was imprisoned the terrible things that happened later including the murdering of ned starks brother and father the rebellion the death of the targaryens etc can be traced to that action it is extremely interesting the thing that the series keeps delivering every action can end in unpredictable consecuences and that includes intrinsecaly good or bad actions the independence between good actions and good consecuences is quite rare in novels let alone tv "
"737" "MRONeill" 2013-04-29 " dsk84  absolutely  its arguable that she out of all of the starks has it the worstshes literally in the lions den and yes we forget that shes supposed to be 1314yrs oldi wouldnt have had better gaydar at that point in my life and i certainly wouldnt have been better suited to pegging the ahole guys from the nice ones i think sophie turner is an excellent actress  you can feel her hope devastation and understandable questioning of her decisionsselfworth simply by a glance at her face "
"738" "Muppet_N2" 2013-04-29 " chinofjim  we already know robert was willing to kill children who stood in his way sending assasins to kill dany and her unborn so almost certainly he would have had joff marcella and tommen killed thats one of the great things about game of thrones the ethics of the characters are mixed with terrible and good behaviours most classic characters are onedimensional the nice guy is also the good guy robert is an example of a somewhat nice character friend of ned stark good sentiments only irresponsible at his worst that in fact justified the massive murdering of children and that raised a rebellion only for jealousy that he is probably regarded as a ethically favourite character above jaime talks about the real ambiguity of the characters and in my opinion a poor lecture from the readersviewers of the series "
"739" "DiamondDag" 2013-04-29 " the last two episodes have really shown why this programme is so strong they have the setting and scope to have epic story telling when it serves then when they need to back off from the grandstanding and save the budget they have some amazing actors and fine writing to fall back on this week was just shot through with great performances from start to finish i think what stood out for me this week was the differences between barristan selmy and jaime lannister we have barristan revered as a great man of both skill and honour who by his own admission is tired of serving bad kings but serve them he has keeping his oath and his honour along with the respect of those around him by doing his duty then you have jaime lannister who was once your typical shining knight but is now known as nothing but an oath breaker he chose not to stand by and do nothing as barristan had done but act against a tyrant to save innocent lives now i have a lot of respect for barristan hes certainly not the kind of man that would push a child out of a window but it says something about what honour is worth in westeros when you can dutifully serve two awful kings and be called ser but save an entire city by breaking one oath and you have to live with the consequences the rest of your life i think it needs pointing out that jaimes act of saving the city was done well over a decade ago what we see of jaime starting to emerge might be the kind of man he used to be before he got branded his entire life as kingslayer maybe over a decade of playing up to that role led to the point where he was cold hearted enough to try and kill a child i guess part of the problem is we dont know if he feels any remorse about that act also has to be said tywin has done a wonderful job of messing up his children he threw a fit because he wants them to start living up to the lannister name seemingly ignoring the fact none of them can change who they are he just wants extra pieces on the board he can move around ignoring the real strengths they have when it comes to family that man is a bloody idiot "
"740" "dsk84" 2013-04-29 " mroneill  i think sansas character to an extent suffers more than the others close to her age well in the book anyway like dany robb jon snow and arya cause shes probably the one that acts most like one would expect someone of her age to act dany robb and jon snow in the mid teens are large personalities and all leaders in some way or another and arya is seen as this cool rebellious free spirit sansa on the other hand is pretty much how i remember most 1314 year old girls to be but just comes across as a bit weak and stupid in comparison i wasnt really a fan in the first season but i dont really mind her anymore whether its anything beyond sympathy however im not sure cause she really does cut quite a tragic figure "
"741" "lennartr" 2013-04-29 " i am surprised that noone has mentioned petyr baelish by name considering how he threw sansa under the bus in this episode remember i am your true friend more to the point this whole war is clearly being manipulated by people like baelish and varys and perhaps others not mentioned yet the lion and direwolf are mostly victims of their own pride and honor i wouldnt be surprised to find out baelish was behind the letter about arryn from lysa the attempt on the life of brandon to plant the seed of wars and of tyrion in order to fuel his paranoia with cersei "

"743" "MRONeill" 2013-04-29 " ntofr1  i think very possibly he would be  the scene between the two of them was simply just another type of sword fight as opposed to bericsandorand certainly lorasoliver  it was one of egos they almost reminded me of schoolyard girls fighting over a boy they have a crush on oh is it we already it seems all rather silly if they both have the same goal which is to see dany on the iron throne "
"744" "VivianDarkbloom" 2013-04-29 " hazh  utter utter bullshit tyrion is a lannister  as in the family at war with hers who are keeping her hostage in the capital tyrion wanted to marry her for her claim to winterfell since tywin wont give him his own inheritance dont bother writing off the character because you cant be arsed to think about her for more than two seconds "
"745" "Ninnyhammer" 2013-04-29 " thoroughly enjoyed the episode for once i was content with the episode which somehow can be missed when it ends with a cliffhanger just to highlight bits and pieces that caught my eye and seem missing in the comments below 1 during berics fight with the hound there seems to be a lot of wild slashing by beric dondarrion if the hound was not distractedscared by the fire hed have cut beric in so many pieces that thoros would have had a task to piece him together talk about losing pieces i had imagined the fight to be much tighter2 the brotherhood without banners are in the riverlands rob stark is at the trident roose bolton is at harrenhal walder frey holds the bridge where exactly did the mountain disappear moreover he isnt a slinky fellow either3 even if you are tywin lannister how can you ask the kings mother to remarry seems a little ludicrous4 qot sizes up tyrion pretty well but then why offer half the wedding expenses keeping the crown under more debt would surely be better no5 will no one mention this snow kissed by the fire yigrette looks every inch of the wildling that john snow would forget his vows for didnt mean to do this but john snows girl beats robb starks girl hands down but in all entirety how the hell did john snow know cunnilingus hed never been with a girl conversation with benjen surely he knew nothing "

"750" "MRONeill" 2013-04-29 " a fantastic opener with the wonderful sword fight between beric and the hound  it was a refreshing change to actually see the action as opposed to the various battles that take place off scene beric had some killer moves and i must admit that i gasped when he lit his sword on fire also fully convinced that the casting for this character was a quality move and yes sarah  this was an episode of many heartbreaking scenes  shireen and arya in particular arya running after the hound with her knife screaming was truly heartbreaking  shes simply had enough of injustices shireen defying her father and visiting her only friend i hadnt realized how much i actually missed davos similarly shows just how desperate she is for company  and the offer to help him learn how to read just makes me want to hug both of them i thought the scene with jaime and brienne was stunningly done the despair in jaimes face when he was relaying the story of killing the mad king was touching i know many will disagree with me but i think the jaime we saw this episode was as true to who he actually is as weve seen disgusting as it is he loves his sister and she as much as i think shes capable returns the feelings yet he cannot be with her like the targaryens would have done he was chosen for the kings guard at 16 being his fathers only hope for a legacy this fated him to forever be a disappointment to twyin per briennes speech to him last episode his problems pale in comparison to the rest of the plebeians in westerosbut theyre still his problems yes yes  i know jaime shoved a child out of a window  indisputably horrible but got wouldnt be what it is without characters filled with dichotomies the hound has done horrible things but hes also a scarred man who has been abused his entire life even the wildliings  their end game is the scale the wall and defeat the nights watch the save their own hides from the white walkers  but who doesnt like tormund giantsbane or mance for that matter jorah has made some really terrible choices in life yet when it came time to make the biggest decision  save dany  he made the right choice as sarah points out would selmy had made the same choice if he had been in jaimes position which was seemingly absolutely the right decision alas im not seeing much hope for robb hereif youre only hope is an already really cranky old man that youve pissed offwell i guess i just hope your wife was worth it and finally more naked jon snow please "

"760" "backfromtokyo" 2013-04-29 " sashabv12  its not just you much as i loved the fistpumping dragonburning awesomeness of last week this one was satisfying on a deeper level for me theres also a really ominous sense of foreboding building and not just because i know whats coming or at least i think not i think its because the pace and structure was so well thought out even though we checked in with a lot of characters it didnt feel choppy an occasional weakness of the show the episode hit plot points in a subtle way with character development and emotion leading the way "
"761" "dsk84" 2013-04-29 " matildamarshmallow  i had the impression of it being a bit choppy too enjoyed all the scenes and as someone who has read the books completely understand the need for it  there really are way too many character arcs to fit in a sub 60 minute episode but it did affect the flow i suppose one transition that did really work well was when shireen was talking to davros about the tagaryan army and they cut over to dany leading her army that scene with jamie lannister and brienne was excellent it was at that point in the books that i was finally convinced what a complex and intriguing character jamie was so it happening on tv didnt quite have the same impact but i imagine many viewers who havent read the books will go through the same process that i would have when i read it "

"769" "CStars" 2013-04-29 " another high quality episode of game of thrones but very different to the previous one while this episode didnt end with the shockers from the previous two episodes it did bring a revelation of how firm a grip tywin has on his children jamie is known as the kingslayer of the mad king but even if the king was sane jamie would have had no choice but to follow the will of his father i think the king of the north has erred in this episode and it could be his undoing going back to a man when you havent kept your word for marriage is not a good idea in the world of got stannis is a mad king in the making isnt he "

"771" "Ninnyhammer" 2013-04-29 " chinofjim  jamie is definitely not an honorable man and did not think about the war between baratheons and lannisters when he pushed bran out of the window he did it to protect cersei and his secret to me jamie has defined his own moral codes and many of his actions are towards justifying these codes to himself for example he tries to escape from brienne by snatching her sword but tries protecting her by lying about tarth when they get caught similarly he doesnt care what everyone or ned stark thinks about him when he murdered the mad king but hed want brienne to call him jamie and not kingslayer i only hope that we get to see those different shades of his character as the story progresses "
"772" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-29 " simonmh  personally i agree re mercy but im not sure thats true in this case as i feel robb was damned if he did and damned if he didnt but yes it was a nice touch showing the trembling hand and i think this is definitely a line crossed "
"773" "sydneysider28" 2013-04-29 " i think the redemption arc that jamie appears to be on now is one of the strongest parts of got  especially to take a character that is as reviled as he was for throwing bran off the tower not forgetting that he has been in an incestuous relationship for years and spawned the evil joffreyand these odd pairings that they set together like brienne and jamie also work very well nice to see  ahem  a bit more of jaime this epi like the way theyve increased the queen of thorns role  she is someone to be reckoned with i think a scene between her and tywin would be awesome and i think jorah was right to be worried about what barriston knows about the poison plot i think he knows and is waiting for the right moment to drop him in itand i agree jon and ygritte shoudl have had the bath first i hope jaime gets to wash his face too "
"774" "matildamarshmallow" 2013-04-29 " a good episode although it felt the teensiest bit choppy to me  inevitable when there are so many characters to keep up with so its easy to forgive im cringing in anticipation thinking about poor sansas reaction when she learns shes to marry tyrion although he might be the best choice ultimately  hed definitely protect her from harm  shes bound to baulk for um cosmetic reasons i love the complexity of stannis  not a nice man as you say sarah but not a soulless one excellently played by stephen dillane i do hope we havent seen the last of gendry although precious littles been done with him of late the actor makes him very likeable jaimes bathtub confessional was amazing big props to nikolaj costerwaldau i like how this outwardly smarmy villain is slowly revealing his longburied moral compass but eventually hell have to properly atone for what he did to branim appreciating the additional screen time and thus insight into the character for robb stark its just a shame the actor isnt more charismatic he certainly looks the part but overall he doesnt leave much of an impression shame "

"779" "ChinofJim" 2013-04-29 " muppetn2  throwing bran from the window was disgusting but as jaime said he did it for love what would robert have done if he found about about the affair and his childrens real father we already know robert was willing to kill children who stood in his way sending assasins to kill dany and her unborn so almost certainly he would have had joff marcella and tommen killed and it would have almost certainly plunged the realm into a war between baratheons and lannisters so in that sense what jaime did could be seen as the lesser evil one child versus untold death and suffering and is comparable to his murder of the mad king one oathbreaking back stab versus untold death and suffering the difference of course is that the mad king brought it on himself bran was innocent and only inadvertently got into that situation because jamie was willing to risk everything on an incestous and treasonous relationship for love in other worlds "
"780" "LadyinSatin" 2013-04-29 " i remember when i read the chapters of the third book that were part of this episode back in 2006 or 2007 somehow i didnt find jaimes great confession believable in the context of the whole story basically he spends the first two and a half books being an utterly evil bastard throwing children off balconies without blinking and lots of other nasty stuff and then suddenly appears a chapter with this big revelation how he saved the whole city but he didnt tell anyone  in 17 years anyone and unveiled all these new depths to his character somehow it had felt to me that martin was desperate to write something about the character that would make him less of a twodimensional bastard so he just pulled this out of the hat same thing happened at least in my opinion with his characterisation of cersei in book four which i of course wont describe because it would be spoilerish but i can subtly say that it felt forced and incoherent regarding the narrative as a whole oh well i honestly dont know why im watching its pure soap opera and sometimes i wonder what exactly happened to hbo the network that used to give us the sopranos and six feet under shows that have revolutionized the form of the television series masterworks that easily rival the best of film and literature now instead of such works we get true blood and game of thrones vampires dragons zombies boobs and arses but as a person of very low selfdiscipline i cannot resist a bit of soap opera and pretty arses every now and then so what can you do also the deed for which he is widely reviled turns out to be something that probably saved the nation westeros is far from a nation its medieval pseudoengland around 1341 with a capital city curiously stranded in croatiathe concept of nation doesnt exist here were talking about a mass of peasants and a few selfish cruel bastards who tyrannize and extort them commonly known as lords and ladies "

"794" "Muppet_N2" 2013-04-29 " muppetn2  i also hate her that is as much as someone can hate a fictional character of course "
"795" "Muppet_N2" 2013-04-29 " benjyuk  i also hate her shes no better than cercei only smarter "
"796" "Elspeth25" 2013-04-29 " sarahhughes  thanks for the heads up i may actually get some proper work done next week the afternoon though nope "
"797" "Muppet_N2" 2013-04-29 " zbzdhbafr  i always liked jaime that is the character from the beggining of game of thrones you know that that king was insane and if youre not to promonarchy killing him is no worse of killing a serial killer besides he is the only one that appreciated tyrion from the beggining the disgusting thing was tossing bran from that window anyway he shows a progresive deepening of his morality through the seasonsbooks that is only compared to the evolution of jon snow "
"798" "ntofr1" 2013-04-29 " benjyuk  def more haunting but i would have liked to see patchface "
"799" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-29 " ntofr1  oh yes good point that was a lovely little scene which revealed a great deal "
"800" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-29 " sarahhughes  and of course if i could edit i will spell weak correctly but then again i have been up since 5am in order to get this watched and up in time "
"801" "ntofr1" 2013-04-29 " sarahhughes  it was also interesting to see jorahs reaction when he found out that selmy didnt participate in the small council he must have been dreading that selmy would reveal to dany that he betrayed her "
"802" "BenjyUK" 2013-04-29 " mockingbirdgirl youll have to enlighten me ive found the character obnoxious sure shes acted brilliantly but that isnt the point "
"803" "ntofr1" 2013-04-29 " hi sarah you had me worried with the the later than usual posting hope you are well that said monday is now back on track another great episode i thought well done jon i guess he was able to overcome the effects that the cold can have on man bits perhaps there are some physiological benefits to being a bastard of the north its interesting that we now see thoros abilities as a red priest and how that opposes what we have seen with melisandre up till now it seemed the lord of light was only good for annoying followers of the 7 and making shadowy baby creatures of death it was good to see that not all stannis progeny are shady killers shireen was well portrayed and it was touching to see her sneak into the dungeons to meet with davos at least they both have one friend its no wonder stannis sees little of his wife if she keeps their dead sons in bottles he would hate any reminder that he is heirless arya broke my heart by telling gendry i can be your family ditto baelish has been saying hes leaving soon for too long great to see cercei taken down a peg or two once again by tywin who again revealed himself to be a master plotter surprising both tyrion and tywin with schemes that may well secure the lannisters standing while they face the apparent tyrell threat if he pulls this manoeuvre then things dont look good for robb who is certainly not going to have an easy time getting the freys back on his side "
"804" "BlueMousse" 2013-04-29 " thought this was an episode of moving performances great opening speech to the lord of light from paul kaye tingleinducing and it seems pod isnt the only former virgin in the seven kingdoms with aptitude for pleasing the ladies though not as good as the boy who spoke no common but a little practise will see to that the minute he got his rocks off jon snuuuuuuw was instantly less dour quite sweet to see him happy in the little love cave diana rigg continues to make any scene she is in crackle being particularly indomitable compared to a more and more browbeaten tyrion this guy is not catching the break he deserves just as brilliant a performance from a desperate arya as she tries to retain some of the merry band that set off from harrenhall and i fear we have seen our last slow pan up gendry without going too fanfictastc why can’t these two get together already awww davos is such a sweetie fantastic to watch cersei’s bitch sneer slide off her face in that final scene to be replaced with the pleas of the young girl she remains at heart great stuff d "
"805" "Woof73" 2013-04-29 " my wife is a religious fanatic who keeps my disfigured daughter locked away in a tower and dont get me started on the jars just in case anyone was wondering my family is just as howlatthemoon bugnuts crazy as everyone else with a claim to the throne stannis baratheon "
"806" "MockingbirdGirl" 2013-04-29 " benjyuk  whereas i am unreservedly loving every scene shes in of which there arent nearly enough "
"807" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-29 " simonmh  i honestly think he had no choice but to execute karstark do otherwise and he is seen as fatally week by his men and loses half of them execute him and he loses the karstarks its no choice at all but its been heading his way ever since he spared his mother as mentioned a different man stannis would have taken catelyns head for freeing jaime would that have been the right decision morally no but it might have kept both the karstarks and the lannister boys alive "
"808" "BenjyUK" 2013-04-29 " simonmh  disagree that this was the episode  think that happened a while ago "

"810" "SimonMH" 2013-04-29 " this was the episode where it moved from compelling to great we explored love and hate in a sequence of profound and moving scenesarya  gendrybrienne – jamiedavos  shireentywin and his childrenjon – ygritte ok perhaps not as convincing as the others and couldnt they at least have jumped into the water before he licked the shrimp ewwww tyrion for once left flabbergasted can anyone match the queen of thorns a scene with her and tywin alifrazier take a bow why didnt robb follow his loved ones advice executing karstark was a terrible decision thus it is leaders feel they need to appear strong even though it utterly destroys them he knew when hed done it that it was wrong how his hand shook brilliant television "
"811" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-29 " zbzdhbafr  id agree thats why ned hated him im not so sure that other people feel the same way i find it interesting that barristan who this episode shows us is a career soldier would probably have stood there and let the city burn because he valued his oath above all  certainly the implication of the conversation with jorah is that he knew the kings he served were bad but his was not to reason why his was just to do or die that said im also interested in how much jaimes decision is driven by the threat to his father and how much by the threat to the city "
"812" "BenjyUK" 2013-04-29 " it was a big ha bitch moment to see tywin slap down cersei instantly after shed been gloating about tyrions reward  sansa however now stuck between three options that are basically the reverse of what they seem finally the song sung by shireen over the credits was haunting much more chilling than the patchface the fool equivalent "
"813" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-29 " elspeth25  ah thank you  i would bet on it going up around this time from now on as there are no more preview dvds "
"814" "sashabv12" 2013-04-29 " i think that this was the best episode so far in season 3 didnt want it to end and had to rewatch certain scenes brienne and jamieaahhh "
"815" "Elspeth25" 2013-04-29 " is it a bit sad that i now spend the best part of monday mornings refreshing this page to see if sarahs posted the blog yet will post again once ive actually seen it this evening  "
"816" "BenjyUK" 2013-04-29 " episode by episode im finding the queen of thorns increasingly hatable leave tyrion alone poor twisted little monkey demon "
"817" "zbzdhbafr" 2013-04-29 " jaime tells his side of the story but the reality is that people hate him not just for killing the king but because as ned start told him you served the king well when serving was safe "
