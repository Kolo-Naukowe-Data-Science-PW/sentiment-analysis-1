"2" "Janel Jones" 2014-04-25 " nice analysis that is the larger picture though cersei had already lost a pack of power with joffrey out of control and jaime away now even with jaime back her power is not restored and as you say this has been convincingly underlined now how to get it back "
"3" "YoothaJoyce" 2014-04-25 " you three are spoiling us  in the pampering sense not the troll sense obviously with these ferrero rochers of crossover casts fabulousi am going to incorporate this somehow into one of my many and varied got drinking games x "
"4" "sharpeiboy" 2014-04-25 " hmmm not too much about ramsay of the boltons who is showing himself worse than joffrey the more we see of him the hunting of tansy is this a common name in got or another plum in the pudding was deeply shocking even more than the horrors we have been watching maybe because it was not really in the books "
"5" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-25 " in a minority here perhaps but i actually dont mind huismans daario arguably not flouncy  flamboyant enough for some  as such not enough of a counterpoint to the older duller ser jorah  ser barriston but i thought his cool was chilled by a degree or two defeating the meereen champion cheesey but i liked the wink   "
"6" "Jess_Ghost" 2014-04-25 " ahem not that sleaze is cool "
"7" "SinBarita" 2014-04-25 " and as you are from the authors comments too i suppose "
"8" "Dougiedownunder" 2014-04-25 " isnt it almost all about cersei she stands before the body of her dead son  stripped of power derived from being mother of the king her firstborn taken her father walks in neither acknowledges nor speaks to her because she is a powerless spent force with whom he need not trade in words he removes her second son from her control the second son departs without a word to his powerless mother on the way up the stairs the grandfather begins to educate the grandson in the ways of courtly propogation of a proper sort within earshot of the boys incestuous mother then cerseis brother walks in instructs all others to leave without reference to cerseis view then he rapes her amost all about cersei being given lessons in male power by her father brother and sons living and dead and throughout the entire sequence she can see exactly how power operates around her and can do nothing to resist "
"9" "Dougiedownunder" 2014-04-25 " doesnt davos survive in the text  against any rational sense of what would happen in the real world  because in structural terms or symbolically hes the bit of stannis that hasnt gone completely bonkers lear has his fool stannis has his davos "
"10" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-25 " sansa seemed to of hardened didnt take a lot of conceiving that dontos has to die i dont think she necessarily agreed but what was she going to do she is in a pretty tight spot "
"11" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-25 " not just then though its all the time she makes mistakes because she feels threatened "
"12" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-25 " she really loves her children and her brother flawed love but love all the same "
"13" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-25 " i am tempted to agree i think he is too aware of his own coolness also  they have given the impression that he is pretty much a guy who spends all his time screwing and so does his girlfriend "
"14" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-25 " i dont think she ever felt any kind of moral qualms about her sex life with jaime it doesnt register for her "
"15" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-25 " if a woman says no then it is rape if she tries to push off her partner at any point then it is rape if this is true then many people have been raped during consensual sex including in the book cercei herself who says no in at least one other sex scene which is consensual yes the party line is that no means no and all that but many people have power interactions and rape fantasies that they play out during sex and in some cultures women are taught that wanting sex is dirty are these things confusing and possibly dangerous sure but they happen we dont know what was going on in her head beyond the fact that the director has told us so saying that nonconsentual sex is rape is rather unhelpful if you look closely at the scene she kisses him while she is saying no and she wraps her legs around him when they are having sex so yes it is ambiguous and not everyone who thinks it was consensual is a potentially dangerous moral invert "
"16" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-25 " um well the director would know wouldnt he since she is an imaginary character and he knows what she is thinking if she sees herself as giving consent then it really isnt rape no matter what it looks like from the outside "
"17" "Jess_Ghost" 2014-04-24 " less easy to spot sandor clegane is the guy in hot fuzz who just says yerp it doesnt quite match my shocking discovery that saul from homeland is inigo montoya from the princess bride    "
"18" "Jess_Ghost" 2014-04-24 " daario naharis is nowhere near as cool as he dany and the shows writers think he is i think he was just about that cool in series 3 but that was a different actor maybe michiel huisman just doesnt have the same overconfident sleaze factor that the original actor had "
"19" "Jess_Ghost" 2014-04-24 " aha thanks for the recap now im even more confused    which is presumably the point "
"20" "redmal" 2014-04-24 " well i am cerseis clearly saying its not right meaning the setting and occasion not sex it just a simplified version of what happens in the book "
"21" "Buntyroo" 2014-04-24 " i genuinely think she is doing that and we are supposed to make that observation its only a viewpoint but that is my reading of it "
"22" "GabrielTheToad" 2014-04-24 " yes thats what i am saying and its what the show was saying and its what the books are saying jaime after pushing bran out of the window after being captured by the starks and released by catelyn after having his hand chopped off by roose boltons men after returning to the bear pit to rescue brienne realised that his life of knighting and fighting and his selfish obsession with his sister was over he goes into depression and afterward tries to become a better man not perfect and not innocent of his crimes including brans attempted murder but trying to improve and that course has been derailed int he show not in the book for the sake of increasing a sex scenes shock value it is there for all to see is raping your sister on the floor of a house of worship next to the corpse of her dead firstborn child worse than pushing a child out of a window i think the two crimes are pretty much equally heinous the difference is the second one is unjustifiable in the story and unjustifiably changes jaimes character from how its portrayed in the novels for no good reason do you see now or are you going to continue to wilfully misinterpret what i say "
"23" "jimmy_mac" 2014-04-24 " cerseis cutting morality into very fine slices if youre correct its perfectly okay to secretly have sex with my twin brother in a bedroom or tower and to bear his children and pass them off as my husbands offspring but i draw the line at sex with him in the presence of our bastards corpse "
"24" "RPHarribo" 2014-04-24 " who is saying it wasnt rape it was i think the question is being asked for the sake of it  it was rape we saw that and the scene was clearly about a power struggle it was a rape scene there are a lot of disturbing scenes in game of thrones and this one has obviously served its purpose "
"25" "Kelley Mickey" 2014-04-24 " yes it was rape this show is the most cynical dark non pc program in television history rape infanticide beheadings castration burning alive incest all all alive and well in westeros thats what makes the show so fantastic nobody gets out alive jaime is a deeply flawed broken manchild cersei is his twin i cant see anything good happening to any character on the show its all politics position and power and revenge its great "
"26" "Alfster" 2014-04-24 " but if we get a proper adult fallout and some sense of the line that was crossed then ill be cautiously interested ermtheres a long lines of lines that have been crossed by people murder torture male genital mutilation incest and most probably there will not be any sense that a line has been crossed in any open waywithin the context of the show no line has been crossed at all "
"27" "trizzer" 2014-04-24 " im not sure how you arent getting this you are very clearly saying jaime was on the way to being redeemed after pushing a child out of a window but now it is impossible as he has raped someone it is there for all to see "
"28" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-24 " yes thats a possibility or they want a reason for sam to run off there maybe during the attack i have to admit i found it odd that the thenns allowed the people at castle black to be warned of the attack since they dont know for sure that jon got back there they are giving up all the advantages of a secret attack on the rear of castle black but that is the only way an attack on molestown would make sense so you may well be right about that possibility and wouldnt the villagers know that the wall was understrength compared to what jon had said  so what does that say about the necessity of a return to crasters "
"29" "Alfster" 2014-04-24 " khaleesi is the best show closer of them all no contest i agree it exhuded controlled power the whole of that scene a brilliant strong end to an episode that had plenty of comedy as well as some shocks "
"30" "GabrielTheToad" 2014-04-24 " well you imply he can be redeemed after the bran attempted murder but not the cersie rape i actually implied the exact opposite i said that jaime was on the road to redemption after his capture and release and his ordeal with brienne in the books he continues on this path the show has ruined this by having him rape cersei instead of having dirtybutconsensual sex with her as he does in the book note where i say in my earlier comments i cant see how theyre going to reconcile this or redeem his character and hes been on a path of redemption since his journey with brienne and this undoes all of that progression for the sake of a stupid shock scene to say that this implies i think he can be redeemed after raping his sister is a gross misreading of what i said "
"31" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-24 " how could it be though if that wasnt how they intended it to be understood they have already finished shooting the season "
"32" "spaycecopper" 2014-04-24 " i got the feeling in the book that martin had written himself into a corner with dany shes clearly going to end up in westeros at some point but she cant until all the drama has been sorted out over there so shes basically spent all the books and all the tv series hanging about having various setbacks just to put off the inevitable also im still distraught at joffreys passing and no one else seems to care  "
"33" "trizzer" 2014-04-24 " well you imply he can be redeemed after the bran attempted murder but not the cersie rape very illunimating "
"34" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-24 " neither does it mean his arc has to always follow a trajectory towards reformed character maybe hes just fallen off the goody wagon "
"35" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-24 " it was it wasnt sarah i think we need a blog poll to see the split "
"36" "ID600606" 2014-04-24 " littlefinger was sent to the vale of arryn to court lady arryn  that was where he was going when he asked sansa to come with him  before she know she was to get married off to tyrion "
"37" "CavalierDisregard" 2014-04-24 " i have always pictured wyman manderley as 90s version have i got news for you mike mcshane unfortunately for the role he has lost a lot of weight now "
"38" "CavalierDisregard" 2014-04-24 " but to answer the point you raise jaimes come a long way since trying to kill bran and thats the whole point hes been on a path of redemption since his journey with brienne and this undoes all of that progression for the sake of a stupid shock scene i havent viewed it so much as jamie being on a path to redemption more that we have simply got to know the real him rather than legend of the kingslayer he is a complex man and always has been he was always protective of those he cared about tyrion cersei and as he got to know brienne he grew to care for her what he did for her saving her from the bear he would have always done for tyrion  cersei also thats not to say he couldnt be cruel to those he didnt care about the biggest change for jamie is now that he has lost the part of himself that identified him who is he "
"39" "CavalierDisregard" 2014-04-24 " as far as sam my thought was that the writers want her away from the wall for the attack for some reason ive been thinking about this it has been clearly mentioned that moles town is the nearest village south of castle black where the nights watch sneak off to for their whoring so it would seem odd if the wildlings didnt pass through on their way to attack castle black with gilly now there it gives us more of a reason to care about what happens there rather than the nameless village that was attacked this episode that is to say there will now be real peril for a character we know rather than the nameless villagers that were obviously going to be killed by the wildlings "
"40" "bleudegex" 2014-04-24 " i agree jaime raped her because hes the kind of guy who is capable of rape and murder in the right circumstances it doesnt mean you cant still like him but dont try and deny it was rape "
"41" "CavalierDisregard" 2014-04-24 " does anyone know the actual story behind why they recast him ed skrein the actor who played him originally has been cast as the new young frank martin in the upcoming transporter prequels so i assume that the filming schedules clashed "
"42" "thecoordinator" 2014-04-24 " i hadnt noticed hodor i might have to rewatch  the hollow crown almost matches it though  qyburn jorah lothar and walder frey craster thorne and viserys as far as i can remember "
"43" "Megan8686" 2014-04-24 " if youve only worked out gilly was in skins i dont feel so bad only just realising bronn was in robson and jerome "
"44" "WelshPaul" 2014-04-24 " he is a great character and i was sorely disappointed when he did not step forward to defeat the mereenese rider however i suspect that the producers have chosen to omit him and several other characters as it would be a big ask to squeeze them into an already packed tv show "
"45" "JRF314159" 2014-04-24 " great point i agree with your idea of a motive for littlefinger get rid of tyrion to get stansa and create a claim on the north but the plan still only works in my mind if tywin is in on it and to kill the king seems an unnecessary addition to the plot if the goal is only to get stansa  why not just kill tyrion however littlefinger has said that chaos is the ladder and what better way to create chaos than to kill joffrie "
"46" "monkey2" 2014-04-24 " has anyone seen the south park got special i found it very relevant to this weeks episode lots of floppy wiener "
"47" "monkey2" 2014-04-24 " the dany scenes make me immediately think of appollo creeds intro against ivan drago in rocky 4 the king of sting the count of montecristo the master of disaster the one the only appollo creeeeed and sly stallones response yo appollo you think theyve got enough names for you the dany story sucks the whole chains coming out of the barrels bit looked like one of those insufferable amnesty international adverts bleurgh "
"48" "DutchDon" 2014-04-24 " theres no way telling if he has even read last weeks pleas to stay with usbut it is what i intended with this post just in case he does read comments i wanted to let him know the comment section remembers on a relatively positive note it appears the name joffreys does stick personally ill also think usurper and kingslayer if i see any future contributions by him and of course refuse to click on them "
"49" "davekaraoke" 2014-04-24 " meanwhile if you fancy a challenge you could always have a go at translating the emancipation proclamation into high valyrian i dont listen to hiphop "
"50" "Jess_Ghost" 2014-04-24 " agree about littlefinger was he in on the conspiracy to try to kill bran im not sure he had cat starks interests in mind at any point he could marry sansa if tyrion is convicted and executed which could give him a claim to the north perhaps i prefer the idea that tywin had his own grandson executed however he is just as calculating as littlefinger and probably more prudent too "
"51" "LordMeowingtons" 2014-04-24 " the hound is just pure awesome hes not a main character i guess but he is certainly one of my favourites even if i know he wouldnt think twice about killing me if he had to "
"52" "Alfster" 2014-04-24 " i keep hoping that dany ends up like rob stark or ned and just gets randomly killed off one week and the dragons just fly off amazing how some people just cant let story lines develop  her story has gone further than many others and with each victory it becomes easier for her with les effort  she is learning how to gain victory as bloodlessly and as easily as possible there is solid quiet strength in her scenes and it has to be shown how she can get loyalty through kindness personally im really enjoying her literal journeyhopefully it will make her arrival on the mainland more powerful and more believable when she presumably starts kicking ass if we didnt have this buildup no doubt people would be moaning about how unrealisitic it is that she would be able to get all those people to fight for her because there had been no build up of her storybecause it was deemed too boring by the programme makers to put in   "
"53" "Jess_Ghost" 2014-04-24 " this reminds me of when i made the mistake of showing my upper sixth alevel lit class the film of a streetcar named desire before wed finished reading the play the girls found it very difficult to condemn stanleys actions because marlon brando was too fit shakes head "
"54" "Alfster" 2014-04-24 " one other aspect of joffreys poisoning worth discussing is the difference in jamies and cerseis reaction to the event maybe its how the scenes have been portrayed but jamie seems hardly bothered at all jaime went straight to joffreys side when he saw what was happening but jaime is a warrior who has killed people and had people try to kill him one gets inured to death  in war one cant allow ones feelings to could ones judgement cersei although she has had many people killed has not had the experiences of killing people that would temper her emotions "
"55" "sanctekybi" 2014-04-24 " personally im not stopping paying attention to those scenes as ive heard missandei gets naked soon "
"56" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-24 " ooops did he missed that then silly me must pay more attention in which case we move that a certain member of the jury be removed for vested interest "
"57" "Drgonzo123" 2014-04-24 " are we all obsessing over the rape because some of us had all started to like jamieif it had been a bolton or the mountain there would be no debate everyone would be saying it was rape no wounder rape convictions are so low if all the defence need to do is conceive the jury he is a nice guy and people like him "
"58" "ACertainBang" 2014-04-24 " think theres any way we can smoke him out "
"59" "ACertainBang" 2014-04-24 " there are moments in the scene when she says no but then actively kisses jaime giving the impression that part of her the part that is disgusted by jaimes amputation and by grieving and by being next to her dead son is saying no but also another part the depraved lustful part is saying yes so yes he shouldnt have done it if she wasnt sure but im not sure it is definitively rape "
"60" "utterflanker" 2014-04-24 " jaime crosses a line here best understatement ever reminds me of the west wing scene where cj asks the president if shes approaching the line she shouldnt cross with him nono look behind you "
"61" "ACertainBang" 2014-04-24 " exactly but for dynasty with worse plumbing well overlook it "
"62" "JRF314159" 2014-04-24 " exactly jaime comes back and gets no attention from cersei except when she tries to coerce him to kill his brother he takes what he wants and in a totally inappropriate situation because hes basically saying that she has no power over him  he has power over her very disturbing but this is the game "
"63" "JRF314159" 2014-04-24 " great topics to discuss  thank you i dont think littlefinger is motivated by revenge for catherine stark hes up to much more than that what does he gain by disappearing stansa the only thing i can think of is that by doing so he makes tyrion look more guilty it is not as if he can marry her or protect her and this act is a massive risk  he rules his little kingdom at the pleasure of the lannisters i have been told by friends who have read the book that i am wrong but i also think it was tywin  he gains the most from joffries death who else gains from having tyrion put to death "
"64" "juvenalia" 2014-04-24 " what im wondering is where pod hid the duck sausage "
"65" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-24 " i am very surprised to hear about buffy i thought it was all wonky props and vampire love ive just watched an episode of the excellent history channel series vikings and i can confirm it made got nearly look a bit like dallas there are plenty of very unambiguous moments for all if a viking ever offers you a blood eagle do not mistake it for a bloody mary "
"66" "Buntyroo" 2014-04-23 " i got the same impression of the scene as you she moved to hold him to her and was actively kissing him at the same time as saying its not right referring to the disrespectful nature of having sex in a crypt at a time like that "
"67" "Mirthin" 2014-04-23 " it used to baffle me why dany was supposed to fall for such an outlandish character the daario i always imagined was similar to johnny depps captain jack sparrow completely bizarre but utterly magnetic the tv guys have completely screwed him up by failing to realise his rascally wit the previous actor at least had a sly glimmer in his eye does anyone know the actual story behind why they recast him "
"68" "Mirthin" 2014-04-23 " im ok with the stark kids growing up the passage of time in these stories is very difficult to gauge since the seasons are so long but i gather the events described in the first 3 books must have covered at least a few earth years it takes a long time to raise an army and move your horde across hundreds of miles in the first book alone tyrion travels to the wall spends a few weeks there then travels south back to winterfell then gets captured by catlyn in the riverlands taken to the eyrie imprisoned released falls in with hill people finds his fathers army fights in the war and then returns to kings landing thats a years worth of adventure easily especially when you factor in the size of westeros and the difficulty of travelling on medieval roads also we all know that kids will grow up very quickly when put through extreme circumstances modern comfort has allowed us to extend our adolescence much longer than it has ever been at any other point in human history you were a fully grown adult by 15 in the the real middle ages and so you needed to be because you were unlikely to make it to 40 "
"69" "Alfster" 2014-04-23 " luckily we dont live in a country where many people are castrated by their torturers where whole families are butchered at wedding feasts or where children are told that huge bald men are about to eat their parents however we do live in a country where many women are raped about 85000 women each year in england  wales according to the ministry of justice yes but we do have plenty of murders gangland killings etc and game of thrones is fictionthe rape should be taken in context just like all the deaths are taken in context if we start tempering fictional scenes in stories to be sensitive to modern day needs then we might as well stop making shows like this people should be intelligent enough to separate fact from fiction  it is annoying when some people cant "
"70" "DiamondDag" 2014-04-23 " hes known for his obedience rather than loyalty i think its a distinction worth making the reason i see him as a mercenary is because hes never expressed any interest in the power struggles going on around him i dont think he cares who hes fighting for "
"71" "GabrielTheToad" 2014-04-23 " its so much easier to argue against something i didnt say than something i actually did isnt it but to answer the point you raise jaimes come a long way since trying to kill bran and thats the whole point hes been on a path of redemption since his journey with brienne and this undoes all of that progression for the sake of a stupid shock scene "
"72" "MissGlenghis" 2014-04-23 " im not so sure it was rape although i agree that the show runners are on dangerous ground when they go down the no means yes route cersei was clearly responding to jaimes kissing all the while protesting that it was inappropriate rather than protesting that she didnt want to shag i know its a thin line and debatable but it kind of looked to me not like she didnt want to shag but that she didnt want to shag there now spike and buffy in the bathroom in s6 was it that was rape this was different cersei was clearly responding while saying not here "
"73" "Sinequanone" 2014-04-23 " tywin has disowned jaime so tyrion is his heir "
"74" "pureimagination" 2014-04-23 " yes rape is usually about power not about sexual attraction my issue is absolutely not with depicting rape on screen i dont have a problem with that as someone who has read all the got books and got the screensavers etcetera yay i wouldnt be watching the show if it was in fact ive always preferred my fiction to be of the dark variety my only problem is people  including the director  watching a scene that very very obviously ends with a rape and then trying to say its not really rape especially within a society where many reallife rapes happen and jurors use the same sorts of words to dismiss the victims "
"75" "Alfster" 2014-04-23 " get real guys this was rape and your point is it was also about power the whole scene it was an excellently put together scene all about power all the way through tywins power over cersei cerseis power over jaime because she thought like other times she could get him to kill for her and had been withholding any affection towards him for her own reasons and finally jaimes power over cersei by forcing her to have sex with him that is what the scene was all about  if some people just concentrate on a sex assault in one scene in episode of a show that has had murder assassination male genital mutilation child killings then they really shouldnt be watching the show and have a distorted view of reality we are talking about a show that is set in an 14th century era  where child brides were raped by their husbands and goes on in the showyou just have to realise it power is got via different methods murder money threats sexin this case it was by sexjust like cersei had power of jaime through sex "
"76" "trizzer" 2014-04-23 " attempted child murderthats nothing rape your sister a line has been crossed "
"77" "Alfster" 2014-04-23 " then its him who does something terrible i will say again shades of grey also then its him who does something terrible just after his sister has asked him to commit fratricidewhich people seem to think isnt as bad as raping someone within the context of this show and his relationship with her and how she has been manipulating him for years personally id rather have a drink with jaime than even be in the same city as cerseiat least id know id have a better chance of surviving how many people would cersei have to kill to be looked up as worse as jaime raping herhow many murders are there to a rape "
"78" "pureimagination" 2014-04-23 " plenty of people here seem not to understand the fuss about the rape on the grounds that its not as morally abhorrent as many other things on game of thrones i personally find the rape  and more specifically the reaction to it  far more disturbing luckily we dont live in a country where many people are castrated by their torturers where whole families are butchered at wedding feasts or where children are told that huge bald men are about to eat their parents however we do live in a country where many women are raped about 85000 women each year in england  wales according to the ministry of justice that makes it really worrying that the creators of a normally smart tv show cant tell if theyve just filmed a rape scene or not it also makes it worrying that many fans cant tell the difference for the record if a woman does not consent to sex then it is rape if a woman says no then it is rape if she tries to push off her partner at any point then it is rape its rape even if the woman goes silent and stops fighting its rape even if she and the attacker have had a previous relationship its rape even if the man might think deep down she wants it its even rape if the other guy happens to be her twin and even if shes a bad person and even if she happens to be grieving and wants revenge for the death of her son get real guys this was rape "
"79" "trizzer" 2014-04-23 " meera is nails "
"80" "aliquidcow" 2014-04-23 " my thinking  and its the same from reading the books  is that martin has a plan for her but other storylines have to get to certain points first before that plan can come to fruition i think hes messed up the timing or pacing of it and is having to stall her storyline a bit she had the biggest characterdevelopment arc in the first seasonbook and then just stood still from there on as a character so i think that tells you something "
"81" "aliquidcow" 2014-04-23 " i think a lot of peoples objection isnt about the unpleasantness of a rape scene per se i think people know what to expect from got by now but more the fact that it changes how that scene happens in the book in quite a problematic way and its not really clear why theyve done it "
"82" "trizzer" 2014-04-23 " so rape is worse than pushing a child out of a window and paralysing him i think some peoples perspective is a bit out of whack "
"83" "longtimelurker93" 2014-04-23 " i agree cerseis body language seemed to show she was enjoying it but she felt it was wrong because they were doing it in front of the corpse of their son in a sept i was torn at the time though because i didnt think the show would leave it up in the air like that "
"84" "Graham68" 2014-04-23 " agreed  given that the passage in the book is written from jaimes viewpoint im almost as surprised by comments here that it was not rape as i am by the comments from director that the televised version was ambiguous she pounded on his chest with feeble fists murmuring about the risk the danger about their father about the septons about the wrath of gods he never heard her doesnt sound much like consent to mewhilst the scene differs significantly as played out on television both are clearly rape "
"85" "aliquidcow" 2014-04-23 " i dont think there was anything random about ned getting killed he was a man obsessed with honour in a cruel and unjust world and he got too close to the truth i didnt find it that surprising when he died in the book in danys case shes undoubtedly getting herself on the wrong side of a lot of people im sure it will come back on her somehow "
"86" "YoothaJoyce" 2014-04-23 " i doff my cap to you and to you principalofthelinebrilliantits a  very subjective compliment to the compelling power of the show that even when i see got actors who are otherwise well known in lots of roles i always have that ohh theres  insert character the last time was in ch4s new worlds when gendry and roose bolton are father and son of course i know its joe dempsie and michael mcelhatton but its a fabulous little bit of a fangirl thrill for meviva the crossover cast "

"96" "Jez Holland" 2014-04-23 " the issue with dany is we havent really scene her interaction with any characters that are currently around her with the story in kings landing we get a group of different characters bumping heads at all turns and we get to the politics in those actionswe really havent seen a scene where dany has done this her political prowess at the minute runs along the lines of give me what i want or dragons if we get some dysfunction in the relationships around her this could happen with jorah and daario then we are likely to see some character development "

"101" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-23 " which is just the same as the time they were in the tower together apparently no one ever told her she should only say no if she really meant it or they did but she didnt much care in any case i wonder if part of the difficulty isnt that we cant see her face for much of the scene which makes it very difficult to judge her reaction "

"104" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-23 " you know it isnt really the lack of experimentation it is the predictability the manipulation of the viewer and the fact that they are covering precisely the same material they did last week it told us nothing we didnt know already and it was like a sort of paint by numbers porn scene it almost manages to make the viper boring instead of cool it also may be a certain about of bitterness  the hound has been wearing the same outfit since the first episode even at supper and arya is complaining that he stinks but we cant have a scene with him even in his shirt much less having a wash or a swim instead we just get more smooth chested boys and boobs "

"106" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-23 " the last scene there with arya he looked to me like he was barely keeping a lid on it i wouldnt pin him as a mercenary  hes always been known for his utter loyalty which isnt really a quality one finds in a mercenary but if you said he needs to find a cause he believes in id say that is true his problem is he is too cynical or maybe frightened or both to believe in anything which is not surprising  he doesnt seem to have had a mother his brother abused him his father failed to protect him and seems to have mostly seen him as an extension of his own ambitions to knighthood "
"107" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-23 " if it was a moment of passion at the wrong time and place then it needed to show cersei more willing if it was meant to be rape then we can all go back to hating jamie a a lot will depend on following weeks think this is the issue  how it was meant in as much that there seems to be an evenish split between those who think it was  those who dont george bless him is seemingly saying not in the book sunshineover to you tv guys to explain the hue  cry and off the record no doubt thatll teach them to mess with my plot sarah below thinks benioff says it was i think albeit his quote is ambiguous as is graves utterance see below personally  without seeing  knowing anything about the subsequent was it  wasnt it debate  without having reached that far in the books when i watched it cold rightly or wrongly i just didnt think it was albeit obviously at one point she says no so id need a good barrister to fill me in on the legalities from there i just think they db  graves have uf made an ambiguous botch of it here and yes how it plays out in subsequent weeks may further inform us but if anyone finds a definitive take from d or b or g on what they thought they were filming id love to see it thanks "
"108" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-23 " yeah it was quite clumsy especially since they conveniently forgot that he has money and it was taken for him last year and arya was right there and i agree about the wagon though arguably that too was about him becoming a somewhat different sort of person from what he was before the blackwater  the story drew some parallels between that and his money being stolen by thoros and his buddies i have wondered if they arent trying in part to account for aryas continuing lack of affection for the hound as time goes on it seems increasingly odd that she doesnt warm up to him more in the books it was more understandable she maintained a very young childultimate justice kind of attitude even when she became confused about that at various points but where she is a bit older it seems odd perhaps they felt they needed to justify her retaining her disdain for him i know people are really enjoying their interaction but it seems to me like they have struggled a bit with this part of the story almost like they gave into the desire to have the fun snarky interaction and comic relief but that has undermined the story a bit i felt rather the same way about arya and tywin  as a viewer it was fun but i thought it was not great storywise for tywin in particular  it was out of character "

"114" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-23 " i think the biggest problem with dany is similar to the one faces on the show with sansa at times  losing her narrative voice means you lose much of the interest with her character not that she is my favorite even in the books but there is a significant internal transformation and the reader can also see where there are personal barriers that are likely to become problems for her "

"117" "Moreisless" 2014-04-23 " one other aspect of joffreys poisoning worth discussing is the difference in jamies and cerseis reaction to the event maybe its how the scenes have been portrayed but jamie seems hardly bothered at all is it because that he could never publicly acknowledge joffrey as his son that his reaction is muted and all he wanted to do was have sex with his sistercersei on the other hand accuses tyrion and tries to get jamie to murder tyrion for such an intelligent person her hate for tyrion surpasses any logical faculties she hastywin on the other hand seems quite pleased with the events schools tommen gives up the mountain and makes a deal "

"134" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-23 " i agree with you about jaime i see exactly why the situation would come about and i dont think it was out of character as such for exactly the reasons youve given i also think however that there might be a disconnect between what the creators thought they were showing and how it appeared on screen  and this happens a lot on tv for example in the first episode of gossip girl i know bear with me chuck bass forced himself on dans sister jenny who was saved at the last minute this was never referenced again because ed westwicks charisma in the role meant the writers wished to make more of a hero of him so my concern would be that if the creators dont see it as rape but as weird but ultimately consensual sex than a similar kind of thing will occur and when it comes down to it im more interested in a show that says war does terrible things and people like jaime are capable of both heroism and rape than i am in one that says nah its just twincest thats how they roll does that make sense "
"135" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-23 " i thought she did she certainly gave one at astapour im torn with dany  i actually do enjoy her scenes but as mentioned i dont feel like i know her as a character much more than at the start she gets some wonderful set pieces but the character development is always some men squabble over trying to win danys heart she largely ignores them i just think emilia clarke gets some great rabble rousing speeches but not much in the way of depth "

"140" "pipdog" 2014-04-23 " my turn to agree with you it nagged at me a little that the rape scene was a little gratuitous and didnt chime with my recollections from the book however  and please dont think im taking rape lightly  i honestly think the scene was pretty tastefully filmed especially when compared with some of the horrors that have been depicted in got as for jaimes motivations i think you underestimate the impact on him of cerseis rejection after enduring all the privations and humiliations of his imprisonment he returns to kl to have further humiliation heaped on him by the one person in the world he loves an ultraproud man was almost bound to snap there youve got me taking the thing too seriously as well "

"204" "davidjones2492" 2014-04-22 " ive got to say that after reading feedback about the episode prior to watching it i focussed on the rape scene with great interest really did not think it was rape at all like the book cersei was initially resistant but i felt that this was not because of an unwillingness to have sex but her fear that they would be discovered and her discomfort that her son was lying dead a yard away i felt that as jaime pressed her she lost her inhibitions and that the act was consensual hence the fact that she kissed him back passionately wrapped her legs around him and did not make any real effort to dislodge him perhaps as a book reader i was influenced by the knowledge that i knew that cersei was into it on the page nevertheless im very surprised that so many people felt it was unambiguously rape particularly given the fact that it is clear that this relationship is extremely complex "

"219" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-22 " theres a joke about renly in there somewhere "
"220" "HashRouge" 2014-04-22 " i really enjoyed this episode apart from the sam gilly interlude and danys scene at the end i think the problem with dany and its becoming increasingly obvious the further into the series we get is that she has nothing whatsoever to do with westeros or any of the main players there from the very first episode it seemed like one of the main plot lines would be danys quest to win back the iron throne yet we are now on the fourth series and she still hasnt set foot in westeros and more to the point it doesnt look as though shes going to any time soon so although i dont mind danys scenes and i like catching up with barristan the bold and ser jorah i usually end up thinking so what was the point of that dany has feck all to do with westeros right now and its westeros with all its complex politics and characters that really interests me i dont frankly care who is in charge of meereen and i imagine a fair few viewers would say the same thing dany is involved in her own personal game of thrones but its not one that interests me in the slightest shes too far removed from whats going on in westeros and it doesnt look like this is going to change any time soon i dislike brans story line for a similar reason bran as a character doesnt interest me especially and now that he is completely removed from any of the action i find myself resenting much or probably all of the screen time dedicated to him and having read the books and knowing where his story line is heading i really hope benioff and weiss give him as little screen time as possible from now on gilly and sam much as i like them are completely pointless as their own separate story line i dont mind them being featured in the at the wall scenes but id rather they didnt get given lots of their own scenes all the other characters who have been given screen time this series have much more to do with the game of thrones which i think is why theyre so much more interesting i know its questionable how much arya has to do with it at the moment but at least we can always see how she might get involved again she may currently be wandering around the countryside with the hound but a that pairing is effortlessly entertaining and b in theory she is headed for the eyrie so we could see her interacting with some key players again soon i think part of the reason that robb starks death always hits everyone so hard aside from the way it happens is that by book 3 the third series everyone has given up on seeing dany reach westeros any time soon and so a lot of people root for robb in the game of thrones instead it was nice to have a good guy in the game even if he was spectacularly bad at playing it dany unfortunately isnt even in the game yet which this far in is remarkable people were ready to root for her but now its just frustrating to see her still marching round a country we dont care about fighting people we dont care about and conquering cities we dont care about "
"221" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-22 " oh absolutely she is ultimately the architect of all that befalls her but it will be interesting to see how she reacts to being so completely stripped of power and allys i also wonder how the audience will react many peoples disappointment with the rape appears to be the fact that they had started to believe in jaimes redemption usually a mistake to believe anyone in got is wholly bad or wholly good will some people find cersei redeemable after whats happened to her "
"222" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-22 " yes and no he didnt know as he said to catelyn stark hed only ever been with cersei "
"223" "ID6414578" 2014-04-22 " as far as i know dany is rhaegars sister not his daughter his daughter was niece of oberyn and killed by the lannisters "
"224" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-22 " no the actors and geographical locations are not connected the model cities appear in the credits if that episode includes action from that city or its vicinity thats it as far as geography goes the actors names appear according to their status as cast members on american tv there are fairly well defined classifications of cast members main cast are those who play major roles throughout the series or season supporting cast are those who play less prominant characters but you will normally see them each episode recurring cast are those who come back to play the same character occasionally and so on where an actors name appears in the credits depends on this classification but can also be a matter of negotiation eg a well known character actor playing a minor guest role might get a more prominant billing a main cast members name will usually appear in the credits even on the rare occasions they do not appear in the episode itself got is a bit more complicated than this because it has such a huge cast and so many parallel story lines requiring protagonists but basically the more significant and established the character is the more likely the actors name will appear in the opening credits regardless of whether they actually appear in that episode "
"225" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " i have to admit id prefer it the other way round "
"226" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " not all or even most of these things were really foisted on her though were they shes really a tragic figure her own character flaws are what are undoing her she lost joffery largely through bad parenting she loses tommen here because her father doesnt trust her with another child she lost mycella arguably because she refused to trust tyrion and made him an enemy she drives everyone away who embarrasses her and she feels challenged by she only loved jaime because she considered him a sort of part of herself and she drives him away because she cant stand to see him in a way that doesnt reflect what she wants to see she has this monstrous vanity that needs to be fed constantly and she eats those who remain close to her her kids and makes an enemy of anyone who wont allow that "
"227" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " actually i bet getting rid of tyrion is part of the reason he is doing it this way in any case getting to the bottom of the crime clearly isnt the point here someone offered to pay pod to tell a false story which likely means they will do the same with others i expect that tywin would rather deal with the real assassin in other more politically advantageous ways "
"228" "Clariana" 2014-04-22 " perhaps like a preening child "
"229" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " no they dont part i think is that they are spread out and some live in the mountains and others are nomadic but a real question is whether they were worth conquering and whether the dornish saw the writing on the wall before the targaryens made a move and so made a political alliance "

"232" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-22 " well i never found dany boring however things do seem to be going too smoothly at the moment the tv series will probably fill two books of what theyre leaving out of the far side of the world martin ironically wrote the books i believe because his tv ideas were too grand for adaptation the producers are making a fantastic effort on condensing a sprawling epic  part of that is streamlining a lot of the story as viewers were demanding drama after drama and at the moment the fresh faced dragon queen is rolling over cities filled with idiots it seems however they know what theyre doing and theyre doing it well "

"249" "Simon Thomson" 2014-04-22 " i was confused by that isnt danerys the longlost thoughtdead daughter of oberyns sister if she isnt surely oberyn should be wondering who the fuck this random targaryen is i might have missed some form of explanation here and i havent read the books but who does everyone in westeros think danerys is i thought she was the daughter of thatonetheyalllove and then from oberyns rant at tyrion i thought she and her twat of a brother were killed like bran and rickon were when the lannisters took kings landing for robert but that cant be right because it seems everyone keeps chatting about the targaryen girl ive missed a thread somewhere "
"250" "Simon Thomson" 2014-04-22 " this is a really great analysis i think i havent read the books and wouldnt be in the least offended if the screenwriters went a completely different way on everything i understand your objection to the scene here as demonstrative of writing for shock rather than anything else but i was quite content with the scene as a representation of this world soldiers do commit rape people who have experienced war and trauma find it difficult to square their code of conduct in survival situations with the new one required by civilised situations i can believe in a jaimie who rapes and remains jaimie and i also find cannibalism and infanticide more offensive as behaviours than rape so said with nerves im a little perplexed by objections to the rape scene that focus on jaimie or the world but as i say inarticulately i do get what youre saying here about objecting to the active decision that may have been made purely to generate this discussion and interest "

"253" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " you know i think that perhaps what happened with the scene is that everyone involved with creating it knew how they meant it and so they read it and watched it that way if i look at it as if i know nothing i would have said it was ambiguous simply because they seem to have such a weird sexual thing going on generally as far as whether rape requires consent on both sides  i suppose normally when we think of a crime there has to be intent you can kill someone by accident even by being stupid but that isnt murder we dont really have any good language to make that distinction with rape which is perhaps why people find it so hard to talk about rationally at times  any denial of intent comes across as denying the experience of the person who was assaulted i dont see jamie here as having any kind of intent to rape i do think there is a narrative out there that says such a thing isnt possible that a person cannot make a mistake like that and is always morally culpable for the crime of rape in such an instance and also would deny the possibility that someone might be initially reluctant and change her mind and i say her because people dont often think that about men i am not sure that is healthy  i dont think it is good that people refuse to recognize those possibilities for sexual crimes when they do for pretty much every other type of crime it seems to me to be just as much a shallow invention is the idea that a woman who is raped must have been sexually loose there is a sort of decision to ignore what makes us uncomfortable "

"263" "Sinequanone" 2014-04-22 " i dont understand why people have a problem with the dany scenes are they mostly book readers and were bored with her in the book and that has carried over i found this weeks scenes to be pretty exciting she has not made that many speeches about freeing people did she make a speech at the previous city at the end of lat season i might rewatch "
"264" "miapatrick" 2014-04-22 " i think she said to robert of course she is a liarthat she was proud to be married to him looking forward to it all then he came in drunk on the wedding night and said ned starks sisters name "

"269" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-22 " i felt thats what they may well have wanted it to be but for me at least it didnt come across like that because her change in response wasnt well delineated  i actually rewatched a couple of times to check because it was going to be such a difficult scene to write about "
"270" "Jez Holland" 2014-04-22 " you are seeing the rape from the wrong perspective it is more about reducing cerseis powerbases which we have seen over the last couple of episodes with that character we are seeing a descent into madness where she is likely to be consumed by killing her brother tyrion and using him as the cipher for any loss of perceived power she hadalso remember the book scene is told from jamies perspective so when viewed from outside of that perspective it could also have looked very much like rape these are also characters who have been sharing intimacy since their childhood and jamie doesnt know how to be with anyone else she has spurned him and he is at a point in his arc where he doesnt know where to turn he retreats to a place he has found comfort in in the past between his sisters legs but this time it is to rid himself of his longing and need for a hateful woman "

"274" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-22 " i think it was more a rebellion using guerilla tactics and the knowledge of their own potentially harsh desert lands rather than fighting dragons as such oberyn embodies dorne somewhat as fierce passionate and venomous "
"275" "CleanSteve" 2014-04-22 " tywin leading tommen away from his mother was the key moment for me the real power behind the throne revealing himself as if there was ever any doubt cersei just looking lost and abandoned completely agree with this also am i alone in thinking that cersei has gone from being the one of tywins children most suited to playing the game to someone who once she got some genuine power just makes enemies out of everyone without thought for the inevitable consequences "
"276" "Moreisless" 2014-04-22 " one thing that is not being discussed here is tywins comments to oberyn about dorne not being conquered by the targeryens does this mean that the dornish have a weapon capable of defeating dragons  i cannot seem to remember any reference to it in the books "
"277" "sunnyone" 2014-04-22 " fwiw my take on the rape scene is that it does become consensual and that cersei gets into it "
"278" "sunnyone" 2014-04-22 " i have at last given in and watched this show because everyone is talking about it youve only just given in and watched this show all three and a bit series so far well you know what happened in the first ep of series one as well as mondays ep of series 4 sorry but yes lots of people love thiswhat to do "
"279" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-22 " well both author and director have said it wasnt supposed to be rape yet people are still going along with that line  we should chalk it down to viewers requiring some scenes worked out more clearly alas too much is really going on in too little time to really show on film whats gone on before "

"283" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-22 " well i think the only people who cared were brans parents and older brother now all conveniently dead and then bran himself is presumed dead by everyone except the boltons and arya and sansa who would care have rather too many other issues to worry about that right now "

"285" "ManWhoFellToEarth" 2014-04-22 " of course but i just doubt very much that danys adwd plot is going to sustain itself over two whole seasons especially seeing as they pretty much ensure shes in every episode because she brings the ratings affc and adwd didnt so much tell longermore detailed stories about the characters by splitting the same time period over the two books really so much as they allowed martin to tell more stories how they pull off this season and next will be quite interesting i think doing affcadwd together with some elements of asos still to tie up if i recall right might mean some of the stories lack momentum as characters dont show up for two three episodes on the bounce im sure the showrunners know what theyre doing and at this point im pretty much prepared to trust them but yeah if i were writingplotting this show id be nervous about that obviously im not as talented as beinoffweiss though  "
"286" "beardo" 2014-04-22 " i think this show would be much better if they cut down on the sex violence fantasy elements and fauxmedieval setting "

"291" "VonSparron" 2014-04-22 " agree that the mountain casting has been messed up he was a brute in that one scene in season one not sure why they got rid of that actor but seemed a mistake to have him essentially absent for seasons 2 and 3 "
"292" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " she does but there seems to have been a change in the show with regards to her relationship with robert  she was more invested initially in the relationship in the book she hated him almost from the beginning never had a child with him and aborted the one time he got her pregnant my impression is that they wanted to soften her up a bit make it seem that her current bitterness came from a sort of romanticism that was abused having and losing a child seems in line with that to me "
"293" "QuestionMark83" 2014-04-22 " go to castle black and tell them im going to eat your mummy and daddy the thenns  a different kind of wrong "
"294" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-22 " i think one of the interesting things which has not really been discussed in the controversy about the rape and the differences to the book version is how it leaves cersei joffrey is deadtommen is being stolen from her by tywin who hates hermycella is in dornetyrion is locked up awaiting trial and they hate each other anywayshes alienated pycelle littlefinger varys margaery etcshes even lost her valuable hostage sansanow to cap it all her brotherlover rejects her manipulative attempts to kill tyrion and rapes her im not saying that i am completely comfortable with how the writers have presented this storyline but if nothing else it does provide a definitive breaking point for cersei "
"295" "CavalierDisregard" 2014-04-22 " secondly dany isnt even in a feast of crows and theyve done basically her whole third book story arc as opposed to stretching it out over two seasons not much to stretch so now theyre going to be onto her plot from a dance with dragons as of episode 4 while a lot of the other plots are a full book back affc  the first half of adwd chronologically run at the same time they are split by location rather than chronology anyone who is in affc is not in the first half of adwd and viceversa with the exception of a couple of characters whose pov chapters overlap each others "
"296" "vegeta83" 2014-04-22 " dany learned the local language i think the targs are slightly based on the ptolemysthey have alot of inbreeding have taken over a foreign country and dany is cleopatra she tries to assimulate with the locals in this case she tries to learn dothraki "
"297" "beardo" 2014-04-22 " is that garbage typical of the writing in the books if so im glad i havent bothered reading them "
"298" "dsk84" 2014-04-22 " i think part of the condemnation is due to the fact that it was jaime who committed it though it appears debatable whether it actually should have been rape or not when joffrey or ramsay commit atrocities people migh be disgusted to some extent but its to an extent what youd expect from the character even with jaime if it were in the first season the reaction wouldnt have been as strong but since this is after he saved brienne from rape then lost his hand then had that fantastic scene explaining his actions then saved brienne from the bear  he pretty much had a season full of redeeming actions so to many people it ruined their view of him "
"299" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-22 " true  he saw or at least appeared to see the bigger threat from the north and seemingly girded his loins ready for a yomp up to winterfellland but as you say now he needs to get his arris over to kl pronto to press his claim he now has no army no ships no gold  no dragons to buy  acquire same so what was he going to do to stop the wildings melissandre better get ready for ano  surely much bigger black baby pregnancy "
"300" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-22 " well at least he drew the line at killing his brother but openly admits killing men to return to cersei "
"301" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-22 " yeah love varys and conleth does a great job varys is oft a very overlooked character "
"302" "dsk84" 2014-04-22 " speaking of that it does appear as though theyve forgotten about who attempted to kill bran could it be a case of it being so long ago that it doesnt matter anymore "

"305" "ManWhoFellToEarth" 2014-04-22 " i think by this point littlefinger is yeah just a bit creepily obsessed with sansa she no longer has any real value as a pawn married off to tyrion whos a traitor in the public mind and with her entire family slaughtered as far as anybody knows she cant really be that useful as a hostage or bargaining chip apart from the stark name which is as tywin said still a very old and respected name shes not got much on right now in that sense in many ways she seems more like a burden to littlefinger in purely practical terms  he cant exactly take her to the eyrie and be like oh hey everyone look its sansa stark because everybody thinks shes implicated in the murder of the king and littlefinger isnt going to be so dumb as to parade her under his protection so shell have to be spiritedsquirrelled away someplace or passed off as someone else at this point the north has rather grudgingly accepted roose bolton as warden of the north so any significant opposition to him is going to have to involve more than a carpetbagger with sansa in tow especially since arya isnt coming home anytime soon most really compelling machiavels have a single very human blindspot and littlefingers love for catelyn is his which he seems to have transferred rather disturbingly to sansa as for danaerys im a huge fan of hers and i really enjoy emilia clarkes work as her i could kind of listen to her give grand speeches in valyrian all day especially when its backed by dracarys which is my favourite bit of music from the show aka the danaerys targaryen will now fuck up your slavehold theme but yeah im glad that weve now conquered the third of the three great slave cities of slavers bay and shell be able to do something different for a while meanwhile if you fancy a challenge you could always have a go at translating the emancipation proclamation into high valyrian "

"320" "sigil" 2014-04-22 " many people are complaining about aiden gillen’s accent here and i think it’s a shame the dialect coaches have done sterling work on this show not just with emilia clarke jacob anderson and any others speaking the high valyrian but also for rory mccann jack gleeson and conleth hill nobody’s been picky about peter dinklage’s english rp though he overdoes the “light l” aiden gillen may not be great at accents – dialect coaches can only do their best with the material they get – but i would hazard that the apparent change we heard in this episode is that now away from king’s landing littlefinger is no longer having to posh up his voice to be accepted at court i am confident that this is a deliberate choice for those unsure about where littlefinger’s taking sansa well there have been plenty of hints as for danaerys’s visit to meereen – just because she took yunkai and astapor doesn’t mean that meereen is going to be easy it looks to be a much bigger city much more easily defended and we don’t know anything yet about what’s inside let’s not forget also that the dragons aren’t being quite as obedient as heretofore the buildup as with all preceding series is slow the payoffs have been rich stick with it "

"327" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-22 " aye it was a good episode after the blast of the last episode we needed some explanation and things moved in that direction setting up some progress as the lannister camp recalibrates in a different way motives of other parties are revealed and other power sharing configurations are explored the stark girls were reminded their rescuers are not knights in shining armour i do however agree that the drama up north and across the sea is not coming across as it should at this stage but theres only fifty odd minutes per ten episodes "
"328" "CavalierDisregard" 2014-04-22 " rape as a plot device is usually very cut and dry what the show did here was far more complex i agree it reminded my very much of the second sex scene in a history of violence the one on the staircase they both start a bit rapey for want of a better word and then turn into aggressive yet consensual passionate sex the scene in a history of violence is very good at showing the difference in the couples relationship at that point compared to the earlier tender and loving sex scene so for me this scene although uncomfortable did show the change in jamie and cerseis relationship with jamie taking some of the power back i also think it did turn into consensual sex as cersei was clearly shown trying to undo jamies breeches saying that i can understand how people have read it differently possibly my take is affected by having read the book "

"358" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-22 " actually its more worse than that cersei now clearly loathes the new gold appendage version of jamie but would quite happily have let him mount her on top of their dead son if it meant he would murder his own brother for her "
"359" "LordTubbington" 2014-04-22 " she also has dragons  this universes equivalent of tactical nukes  and is magically fireproof or selfresurrecting plus in this fictional world her values are not really western  she left the actual west as a baby and was brought up on a continent where slavery is common and unexceptional and even in the west it seems to be uncommon for economic rather than religiousmoral reasons and only seems to have developed a personal issue with it when she herself was bought and sold for political reasons plus if youd read the books youd be aware that the mighty whitey liberator theme ends up in an imbroglio all too clearly modelled on modern iraq and the warriorsorceress queen is a staple of the genre  even the outrageously sexist tolkien has eowyn and galadriel and luthien "

"363" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-22 " yes and what i will say in case the review doesnt make it clear is that i think the show set jaimes actual feelings up very well i had a fair amount of sympathy for him in that i can see why it gets to that point what im interested in is how they then deal with him crossing that line if we get the fallout then good if its swept away not that likely on this show then it will be an issue "

"367" "LordTubbington" 2014-04-22 " although i think the problem was the utter implausibility of bookdanys relationship with an insufferably selfish prat at least newdaario is genuinely attractive and from what little weve seen so far notably less obnoxious than olddaario and his killing the meerenese champion in a duel is a change from the book where another character who has so far been omitted altogether does it so having her potentially fall for someone who is brave clever deadly a good leader of men etc  in fact everything that jorah and barristan are plus young and handsome  is rather more plausible even if the new actor is rather less interesting to watch than the old one "
"368" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-22 " i actually think its because martin has tried to write him a devil may care bad boy rebel archetype but its just terribly flat and there is no substance to him at all hes dreadful in the books and the actor they had playing him last season was spectacularly bad this season he has improved to just inoffensive but he doesnt work what so ever he writes evil characters well and scheming characters brilliantly but he has real trouble writing effortlessly cool characters aside from oberyn martell i dont think there is another cool character in the whole series "

"371" "LordTubbington" 2014-04-22 " a twin brother and sister still have sex over the corpse of their murdered son in the book  and were arguing about plausibility and as written it is to my mind even more implausible in that bookcerseis enthusiastic consent is implied  which is part of martins outrageously sexist depiction of her as a brainless but wicked slut vastly prefer tvcersei in all respects "
"372" "Foom" 2014-04-22 " maybe its a setup for the big reveal that there never was a littlefinger just a succession of faceless men playing him in a conspiracy to gain control of westeros "
"373" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-22 " my apologies if its any consolation it files under constructive though and not as an out and out dig it just stood out  not least because ayras own arc is fascinating moving as she does from the structure and ethics of the extremely tight knit pack of house stark to gritty reality of life in house survival and from a former mentor of impeccable standing and morals to one from completely the other side of the track "
"374" "LordTubbington" 2014-04-22 " here the writers are having to compensate for martins failings as a writer  his cersei turns out to be not just a monster but a grotesquely incompetent one completely lacking in any qualities or motivations a tv audience can identify with at least from the moment he gives her point of view chapters of her own tvcersei is clearly a player with a capitalp  after all it is she who gets the game of thrones line and she is tywins daughter and tyrions sister  so everything that is basically inexplicable in bookcerseis arc other than by her being as stupid as she is evil and slutty has to be given believable motivation plus rape or not having parents fuck over the corpse of their murdered son is just atrociously bad writing on martins part  and sadly this gets worse with each book as they can crawl torpidly from his pen in fact id be quite happy if he never finishes at all as he almost certainly now cant and the tv guys complete the saga based on his outline "
"375" "VonSparron" 2014-04-22 " exactly he threw a child out of a window "
"376" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-22 " well said that man woman dog albeit the passion that such people exhibit which is brilliant by the way understandably draws them ever further in  and before we know it theres a thesis or three on slavery personally i like to watch it twice  first for the sheer drama of who kills  shags  stitches up who and then i do a mental re run usually with the help of this toppest of top bloggs to double check it broadly fits with the world and the characters of the seven kingdoms as i understand them "
"377" "Moreisless" 2014-04-22 " i thought the episode was very good the general tone of the complaints seem quite petty to me1 the rape scene  jamie and cersei relationship is way beyond what is normal and the events in the sept should be judged with that in mind2 daenerys groundhog day  what else is she supposed to do when she gets to another city filled with slaves 3 aiden gillens accent  too busy being creeped out by what he said rather than how it sounded4 sexposition  200 pages of dialogue from the book summarised in one scene as well as boobieswhats not to like "
"378" "JamesWMoar" 2014-04-22 " protective not projective projective kind of describes his attitude to sansa as well "
"379" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-22 " its certainly possible that the targs share a connection with their dragons in much the same way the direwolves seem to be connected to the stark children however at the risk of being pedantic its worth pointing out that a warg like orell is tied to an animal in his case an eagle and he cant just warg into any animal he likes a more powerful but less common warg is called a skinchanger thats a person who can warg any animal they wish but being able to warg another human as bran has done seems to be something entirely separate skill and either nobody else in the story can do it or just nobody else that we know of yet either way i think its entirely possible that the targaryenstarks are wargs of some sort but if a dragon was twinned with a tagaryen im not sure another warg could simply take up residence in their head so to speak "
"380" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-22 " youre right its a flawed metaphor curse you "
"381" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-22 " ha i also have some sympathy with your viewpoint and agree some great dialogue this week but that said if i couldnt just skate over the scene in question and i dont think some discussion about it is a bad thing "
"382" "VonSparron" 2014-04-22 " tywin leading tommen away from his mother was the key moment for me the real power behind the throne revealing himself as if there was ever any doubt cersei just looking lost and abandoned what came next with jaime and cersei was genuinely shocking it reminds us of the ambiguity of all the characters in the show cersei has constantly been painted as the evil ice queen whereas we have come to warm to jaime over the last season then its him who does something terrible reminding us that this was the man who pushed a child out of a window i know some people find danny frustrating but she can speak high valyrian to me any day the problem with her is that her storyline feels disconnected from everything else that is happening in the show the wall may be leagues away from kings landing but at least its still in westeros "
"383" "hellcat" 2014-04-22 " hmmm i actually have some sympathy with your point but i think that it is valid to expect such things as plot and character continuity in genre fiction no and also to feel a little icky about rapeasshockvalue in fiction in general "
"384" "lichkingsmum" 2014-04-22 " shes basically treading water until the dragons are big enough to ride then the fun will begin "
"385" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-22 " yeah  damn that tywin at times you have to have grudging respect for him dance is great and a big fan of the books "
"386" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-22 " of course the crucial difference between he and arya is that shes a wolf and believes in her pack whereas hes the hound and hunts alone mmm last time i looked sarah a hound was a pack animal too  arguably more so even than a wolf the metaphor here is struggling the hound confusingly seems to me to be cast as the classic lone wolf here surely does ayra believe in the pack anymore hers has been decimated before her eyes and must have left her very cynical at this point thus right now shes doing a very good job of being a cardcarrying member of the trainee lone wolf club herself "
"387" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-04-22 " well most importantly the director has said its not rape the twins relationship is complicated and this scene reflects some of it jamies strength is what cersei wants and her character uses sex to manipulate people rarely are they left alone hence the unsuitable location for this tofro display of long yearning but also boiling down to a desperate point in their relationship "
"388" "pipdog" 2014-04-22 " to judge from a good many of the comments on here i think some people have started to take the show and themselves a bit too seriously a few of the more deluded of them even appear to believe they could do a much better job than the useless mob that are producingdirectingwriting it at the moment please folks calm down and accept got for what it is a superior fantasy adventure with no pretensions to being great art by doing that you will appreciate all the great things about the show for instance some classic bits of dialogue this week  just point out the next map shop you see and ill buy you one "
"389" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-22 " as he said if youre a famous smuggler your not doing it right davos is smarter than he lets on hes not a learned man and hes surrounded by people who pretend to be more than they are he much like littlefinger and varys survives by pretending to be less than he is where as littlefinger can see the truth of things clearer than most and exploit it to his own advantage davos can see the truth of things and implores others to do the right thing even if its to his disadvantage "
"390" "pipdog" 2014-04-22 " you dont like sex and violence are you sure you should be watching got "
"391" "miapatrick" 2014-04-22 " yes and i think she said something about robert holding her when they were grieving the one moment of tenderness in the relationship at the time i thought jamie might have killed it lion after all "

"393" "pipdog" 2014-04-22 " have you ever thought of writing your own fantasy adventure it would spare you from having to watch a show where the writers are obviously doing their best to annoy the hell out of you "
"394" "Clariana" 2014-04-22 " cersei is a bit of a spinner she lies basically dont lets forget jaime warning loras last week that if he ever married cersei and if they ever conceived a child she would kill it "
"395" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-22 " ive mentioned this below but basically i really wanted to make it him because i kept thinking who is this guy and why do i know him but the preview tape had no cast list and i couldnt get anyone from sky or hbo to clarify who he was not that this was their fault they cant be expected to know who i mean when im going you know that guy hes in a comedy ive seen recently you know who i mean "
"396" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-22 " now thats an interesting point and one i think might well be right i just think this scene was so badly muddled that its going to be a real problem down the line "
"397" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-22 " but without getting too far into booktv stuff because this blog isnt about that the book scene is pretty different from the tv scene albeit possibly because we see it from jaimes viewpoint rather than a third party regarding the scene itself  if you had written if jaime and cersei think it was consensual what difference does it make youd have a point plenty of people have complication sexual relationships and boundaries are crossed but actually if one of them doesnt think it was consensual then it matters rather a lot if she said no and that really isnt a political correct view its a fairly standard one you cant just say well i thought she wanted it anyway and thats the way our relationship rolls as to this specific relationship  now this is where it gets complicated because i think the director believed that he was shooting a scene where jaime starts by forcing himself on cersei but after initially saying no she weakens and says yes based on the complexity of their relationship the problem is a it wasnt scripted like that and b thats a very complex thing to get across on a tv show and not one i personally think was wise to attempt could they have done the scene differently yes they could have had jaime pull back they could have had cersei force the initial contact more for her own motives they could have made it a mutual recognition of need between two people who are grieving and lost their son having them have a mutual sex scene in front of their dead sons body would have been game of thronsey enough i think the problem for me is that they went for the obvious shock scene and not only do i think rape really has to be well thought out when used as a plot line i also think theyve backed themselves into a character hole here that may be very difficult to get out of apologies for exceedingly long post "
"398" "NZerDan" 2014-04-22 " on the tv show the camera is necessarily external you dont know what anyone is thinking or feeling just what they are saying and doing if the show had retained some of cerseis dialogue from the books it might have left a somewhat different impression  but that dialogue was very much shaped by the circumstances of the books delivered by a woman who is seeing her lover again for the first time after a long while apart during which she feared he was dead i am not sure it would have worked with the new timeline thats really all i can say on this issue the scene was always intended to be disturbing but i do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and cersei is fearful of discovery she is as hungry for him as he is for her grrm reaction to the rape scene 100 not rape in the book "
"399" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-22 " i long for an edit button its very annoying i agree "
"400" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-22 " i dont dislike him as much as i disliked the first daario who i agree had ridiculous hair but i did think the scene in front of meereen was a little too like the bronntyrion scene the problem i have with daario is that the writers seem to want us to think hes incredibly cool but theyve not really given us much to justify that "
"401" "CentralBelter" 2014-04-22 " danys storyline does raise interesting questions about conquest and liberation but the problem is that we seem to be circling round those issues rather than letting them progress it actually seems to be going backwards in terms of her character development  last season there was a sense of her messiah complex becoming problematic and i liked the movement from desperate prophet in the wilderness to a growing sense of her own power and potential i found it believable that someone of her background would never waver in her belief in her right to rule  shes like stannis in that sense i think theyre trying to play with our sympathies  they want us to cheer for her liberation campaign but start to have doubts too but her character needs to move along with her army "
"402" "CentralBelter" 2014-04-22 " yes that seems fair enough  otherwise what would be the point in having sam send her there with promises that shed be safe dramatic irony etc "

"435" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " i agree about the weird money stealing bit  i could not figure out why arya asked him about that when we all know he got that iou from lord beric on the other hand you are the first person i have seen mention it however my feeling about the thievery and bashing the nice man on the head is that we are meant to be seeing the hound begin to violate his own moral sense in the past although its a bit odd he has actually had a pretty iron clad sense of right and wrong and stuck to it which was why he would never become a knight  he thought of it as a sort of institutionalized lie to swear to protect the weak and then do the job of a sworn fighter so far he he abandoned the lannisters who he was sworn to but realized were really bad and did so partly out of personal fear he faced that fear in the fight with dondarion and overcame it he killed all those guys going around stealing and killing and raping in the name of the king and i think felt righteous about it now he is pretty desperate in a physical sense he doesnt really know what he is going to do with his life and he is beginning to see that desperation and uncertainty and his own cynicism break down his own moral code as far as sam my thought was that the writers want her away from the wall for the attack for some reason "
"436" "ffuzzy" 2014-04-22 " in that case the reason i think she kicks arse is that she is the only female character that calls the shots at the moment all the others are prostitutes or feeble if or when yara reappears then she will be the arse kicking woman of the series  brienne of tarth has gone weak at the knees "
"437" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " also i dont think he meant that he didnt care that she said no she said it was wrong  that is having sex on the floor of the sept next to their dead son and he didnt care about that it goes along with the realization he had on his journey home that he no longer cares that their relationship is seen as immoral by outsiders and he would like to marry her despite what people would think including his father "
"438" "Sinequanone" 2014-04-22 " i really liked this episode really enjoyed daenrys speech and daarios rather easy takedown aryas expression after she finished her soup  priceless charles dances too the wildings killling women and children  less sympathetic to them now i thought whatsisname was realising that jon was maybe not so useless but sarahthat said i wouldnt like to be among the poor fools who have to go back to crasters keep with him thats clearly not going to end well also not likely to end well sams decision to send gilly and child outside castle black silly sam how safe is she going to feel when a group of bald cannibals accompanied by a flamehaired warrior getting over the sudden breakup of her relationship by turning people into pincushions arrive in mole town are these spoliers nothing in the show suggests these things i hope these are not spoliers from your book reading "
"439" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " what i mean is that today in 2014 we are all told that if someone says no in a sexual encounter that is the end of it but that is a cultural expectation the idea that that is the most important way to communicate what you want about sex in fact the reason we find that way of obtaining consent has to be pushed so much is that it is pretty unnatural naturally peoples communications about sex are much more subtle and often nonverbal so in a culture where people are used to those kinds of cues can we expect them to observe modern ideas about obtaining legal consent and can we assume that if they do things differently it must be nonconsensual i dont think we can  it might be but maybe not if jamei nor cercei think it was consentual what difference does it make if she said no there is every indication in the book storyline that interactions like that were pretty usual with them  she does say no even when she wants sex who knows why  she feels it is expected she likes to feel dominated she likes to feel she has driven someone to a lustful frenzy so was it wrong for jamie to think she didnt mean no when she hasnt always before he knows her pretty well while he could be mistaken and that is a danger in that sort of sexual interaction i dont really see any reason to assume he is in this instance her reaction which we havent seen will tell us how she perceived the situation "

"444" "UsernameRequired" 2014-04-22 " nobody noticed how littlefinger could summon up a mysterious fog to shroud his ship despite the fact it was a peach of a day when sansa and dontos were escaping kings landing he goes of to the vale for a bit and comes back amidst a bit of regicide with fancy dracula on the demeter powers and all anybody can talk about is how he sounds a bit different thats top class misdirection "
"445" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " unless he is flat out lying or grossly misremembering and there is no indication that he is that blind as a viewpoint character cercei was initially reluctant  reasonable given that it was a semipublic place with her dead childs body nearby  but changed her mind fairly quickly not to mention she doesnt seem later to remember it as a rape and complains that she never had good sex with anyone else "
"446" "ffuzzy" 2014-04-22 " actually i agree with most of what you say though to hold power you need to make allegiances and rely on other whether man or woman there is so much wrong with this from a feminist standpoint i wouldn’t know where to start but im not sure this is the best space for me to rant my thesis of got misogyny i as suggested below to another commentator should just stop watching if so offended but it’s a well written distraction and i’m far from home and bored "
"447" "DMcCool" 2014-04-22 " believe me ive tried but he writes like a child makes great tv though "
"448" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " i think that what people have to remember is that just because it looks like a rape to us who are outside observers that doesnt mean that is what it meant to the characters at all people seem to find the possibility that the show would not go all moralistic on that a bit disturbing which is interesting really because in general people feel tv should avoid being moralistic about things like dornish princes having cheezy group sex scenes and just show what happened "
"449" "DMcCool" 2014-04-22 " i agree if you read her storyline with danyasblair it becomes far better watching except it isnt written like that every scene with her in is painful bending over to try and make her an some sort of inspiration figure there is zero pathos zero sympathy there just one smug girl and an army of male admirers if they ever get round to showing some consequences of her actions that might be good television right now we are forced to sit through essentially the same scene every episode its getting old even for her supporters "
"450" "ffuzzy" 2014-04-22 " i think sams decision was made with his dick "
"451" "jennifera30" 2014-04-22 " i was chatting to a friend about this earlier and she couldnt understand why i didnt rate the dany storyline either she made a daft comment about girl power which i suppose equals your strong woman one made here obviously she was a child when she was a slave to her brother to be passed to her new keeper in the form of khal drogo she had no agency and the fact she survived at all was amazing however she mainly survived by learning how to fuck him good and by taking advice from jorah who wants her too she got her dragons eggs as a slave gift and the only brave thing she has ever done is to walk into the pyre which since she didnt know what would happen came off a bit suicidal since then she has relied on the dragons and on her besotted male companions daario again here took centre stage not saying i dont like her i dont much she is petulant but in what way is she powerful or kicking ass ooh that was a bit of a rant wasnt it sorry but i hated the storyline in the book and not much keener on it onscreen "
"452" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " i think he really likes arya actually hes always feeding her in the books he seems to have kind of a caring personality he seems to like dogs and horses as well he strikes me as someone who might have been a rather sensitive child who had to learn to bury it pretty deep "
"453" "DMcCool" 2014-04-22 " thats right any criticism of dany is just misogyny by another name shes such an inspiring figure with her cowgirl position magic children and men who do whatever she says because of a her beauty and b her superior western values a role model for girls everywhere its all about arya anyway thats a character with pathos charm and a real interesting arc to follow arya drinking a bowl of rabbit stew is more engaging television than dany sieging a city "
"454" "GabrielTheToad" 2014-04-22 " to say it is obviously rape is i think simplistic whatever the politically correct view is these days its not a matter for political correctness whatever you think that means  she said no many many times and he said he didnt care and that means he raped her the fact that her feelings towards him are complicated and that she is a complex character doesnt change the fact that this was a rape "
"455" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " what weve been told to think consent looks like is something weve learned and it doesnt always even work all that well in real life today people arent always straight forward whether they are supposed to be or not if you look at the scene in the tower before bran gets pushed cercei was saying rather similar kinds of things things that didnt look like consent  bran actually thought he was hurting her because she was telling him to stop  and yet there seems to have been no question that it was consensual and she was enjoying it she seems to have liked sexual relationships where she dominated mentally by controlling others through their desire and she generally seems to have had an intense need for others to desire her and demonstrate that desire people who pay with that sort of emotion in other people are likely to find it gets out of hand at times there will be misunderstandings i thought that what her father did to her in that scene in the sept was far worse and more disturbing than the sexual stuff "
"456" "jennifera30" 2014-04-22 " you feel so dirty i would stop watching or reading then we will all let you know what happens in the end "
"457" "ffuzzy" 2014-04-22 " i am quite enjoying the daneyrs storyline and seem to be able to look past the whole ‘white man’s burden’ aspect but then i like to see a woman kicking arse everyone loves arya but am i the only one to start getting a little tired of the whole journey and her whining no slight on the acting maisie is excellent as usual i do appreciate that she is high born and not as ‘street’ as she thinks she is but you’d think she’d get less obnoxious as the realities of the real world kick in very concerned for sansa where is the home she is being taken to on husbands  the next one should be easier  if the poor sod lives long enough great bit of tv to see cersei’s face as she realises her last remaining son is being taken away from her tywen isn’t letting her screw up this one up i’m surprised he wasn’t around to oversee joffrey’s kingship earlier i also loved the pantry raiding comment i may bang on about the nudity but there are some real gems of dialogue last thought— do we really need to worry about winter life seems nasty brutish and short’ enough already "
"458" "GabrielTheToad" 2014-04-22 " the episode makes that quite clear she says no repeatedly she says stop repeatedly she says it isnt right he still does it there is an argument to be made about the transgressive nature of their relationship and the fact that it always has an element of the forbidden but i think were meant to understand that jaime crosses a line here a line he does not cross in the novel im upset about this scene not just because it was uncomfortable to watch and because it was a departure from the books that the story might not be able to support but because now jaime is a rapist it narrows the ways in which his storyline can develop hes a rapist hes lost the audiences sympathy no matter what other changes hes made to himself since his capture if he gets away with this then the audience will resent him for it and if he is punished for it where does that leave his character for the rest of the seasons adaptation i cant see how theyre going to reconcile this or redeem his character "
"459" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " i think if it hadnt worked it would just have been a matter of trying again another time she was pretty much trying to give him opportunities to get himself killed which might be slower than outright murder but is pretty hard to get blamed for "

"461" "Spinkat" 2014-04-22 " i have at last given in and watched this show because everyone is talking about it i feel so dirty it is full of gratuitous violence and sex there is probably only one loving couple in the whole series that actually gets a normal albeit tame sex scene some characters exist only to be tortured yes the heroine was maritally raped by her sun and stars at the beginning and then fell in love with him yes the queen mum was raped by her brother next to the body of their son the same brother who in episode one casually pushed a child from a tower and who later became part of the many plots of comic romance between captor and capturer before becoming part of the many plots of sadistic torture the same son who tortured prostitutes and puppies did i read that in the book  guess showing puppies tortured is a step too far for the producers yet i still want to know what happens to the dragons and arya and tyrrone i thought i could read the books but they are tediously long and not much better than the series and i just figured out the books are endless i despair  is this what the world loves cant the dragons meet the dead men with blue eyes and get the whole thing done with and the bastard marry that queen and bring north and south and east and west together and have the drunken imp as the hand "

"476" "Toronto1" 2014-04-22 " it changed a lot from last year strange that "
"477" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " i am pretty sure this is why they made the new tommen a few years older than the last one even got is a little uncomfortable with marrying an actual child actor to an adult "

"479" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " i find daario really annoying in the show and the books  i can only think he is intended to be that thing with the naked lady daggers is so lam like a man with a nudie pen who is always fondling it but i have often felt that dany has bad taste in men she likes the really flashy obvious ones daddy issues maybe and girls the age her character was written tend to have atrocious taste in men at the best of times "
"480" "ACertainBang" 2014-04-22 " he played it down with joffrey which means he either now has some new information or was deliberately hiding it from the recently deceased king and if he was hiding it did he know that joffrey wouldnt be in power for long "
"481" "EnglishDisco" 2014-04-22 " i think there is question whether it was rape and im sorry but that first paragraph from the book does not turn the scene into rape i think she changes her mind quite obviously and is more than a willing participant the shows version is not as obvious but i still dont think its black and white rape watching it again you can see that shes taking part alex grves has come out and responded here  httpwwwvulturecom201404gameofthronesdirectorontherapesexscenehtml "
"482" "ACertainBang" 2014-04-22 " i agree the qarth stuff was a bit duff but there have been some real highlights i would add the ser friendzone elements to this its been fascinating to watch the times when jorah and danys relationship has been strained as glen acts it so well "
"483" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " she wasnt without power though she it at various times she throws it all away because she dont know what to do with it "

"485" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " really i thought that in season one it sounded like she was quite upset about it dying "
"486" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-22 " shes marching the right way just taking a long time about it "
"487" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-22 " why would jaime rape the woman he worships after saving brienne from that same fate i think the idea is that jaime rejected by cersei since returning to kl has a moment of realisation when cersei tries to get him to kill tyrion that she has been manipulating him their whole lives and the rape is a futile gesture of revengeregaining control obviously its uncomfortable viewing as rape scenes should be and slightly different to the book version but my real problem with it is that not enough attention has been given to the deterioration of their relationship so it more or less comes out of nowhere "
"488" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " i dont know im canadian and i find his accent really distracting not just the accent really but it sounds like he is trying to breath through his nose while he is also talking "
"489" "ACertainBang" 2014-04-22 " a tricky topic but i did get the impression that there was some ambiguity towards the end in which case it was very well done jaime did call her hateful he did force himself on her he did do it beside their dead sons corpse and she did make some protests but there was something else there as well perhaps it was the transgression sarah mentions rape as a plot device is usually very cut and dry what the show did here was far more complex "
"490" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " i really like sams storyline  i think hes a really interesting character he changes more than almost anyone "
"491" "15Beats" 2014-04-22 " i wish writers had that sort of creative control over adaptations while grrm might be in the rarefied class of writers who do i still cant see the rape interpretation when you look at the book cersei was urging jaime on  you can find book excerpts in other comments or go read the book yourself its pretty icky dont say i didnt warn you anyway unless jaime started hearing words that werent actually spoken cersei was begging for it if they went against grrms original story  character development without his blessing hell just have to have a good cry into that big ol check from hbo "
"492" "Dukered" 2014-04-22 " i thought it was a disappointing episode albeit with some great moments as usual littlefingers accent is becoming an unnecessary distraction and you wonder what the director is up to the actor more or less held it together for three and a half seasons which is why it is so strange for the accent to suddenly slip so drastically the rape scene was another unnecessary deviation from the book imo very uncomfortable viewing i dont know what the screenwriters are doing with the hound either first we have an unnecessary discussion about why the hound has no money despite the fact that we all know beric dondarrion and the brotherhood stole it in season 3 we establish that the hound does not steal which is why he didnt steal from joffrey a rich ctthen he steals in his next scene from a nice poor man who gave him food and hospitality perhaps there is a point to all this that i am missing but it just seems like sloppy writing to me its as if the writers decided we were supposed to like the hound in episode one and now we are supposed to dislike him again thats fine in principle but it seems too contrived at the moment the events at the wall seem very watered down compared to the book as well which is a shame because it is at this stage of the story the most interesting plot line i fully expect the next episode to be more eventful because this one seemed a bit like a filler to me and yes sam taking gilly to molestown was stupid i thought that all sam had going for him was his brainoh well "
"493" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-22 " so i have two things to say one is that what struck me about the situation with he hound this week is hes becoming what he actually hates stealing from those peasents wasnt something hed have likely done before  part of the reason he hated those men that had belonged to his brother  polliver et al  is that kind of behavior he seems to be rapidly unmaking himself secondly this idea about rape i dont remember if it was evident in the show before about jamei and cercei but it seemed that in the book a number of their previous sexual encounters similarly had her saying no no no when actually she meant something rather different he also mentions something to the effect that she always wanted to be pursued rather than the one who did the pursuing cercei is a complicated character and her relationship with jameis is complicated and to say it is obviously rape is i think simplistic whatever the politically correct view is these days "
"494" "ACertainBang" 2014-04-22 " davos for line of the night  seconded "

"496" "Dukered" 2014-04-22 " daario isnt cool in the books either it is baffling what dany sees in him in the book or on screen but it seems to be entirely physical "
"497" "Dukered" 2014-04-22 " i think the rape scene is all part and parcel of making cersei more sympathetic this doesnt make sense in the last episode she ordered the leftovers from the feast to be given to the kennels that was incredibly inhumane and spiteful  and not in the book why go out of their way to make cersei more evil in one episode just to then go out of their way to make her more sympathetic in the next "

"499" "ACertainBang" 2014-04-22 " im hoping the pay off down the line is worth it too with the sam and gilly storyline as much as the rape one the molestown manoeuvre was frustrating for a number of reasons including the apparent stupidity of sams plan to protect gilly and his inability to tell her how he feels however i have faith that where this sub plot ends up will be worth the setup "
"500" "Dukered" 2014-04-22 " the problem with his accent is that it is all over the place in season 3 for no apparent reason he started to sound less english and in the latest episode he has abandoned the english accent altogether he actually sounded and acted like a completely different character it was weird and distracting imo i dont care what accents the actors choose as long as they stick with the one the have chosen "
"501" "KieRanaRan" 2014-04-22 " fuck the king that goodbye was the real tragedy  "
"502" "discoveryofslood" 2014-04-22 " i dont really see why robert seized the thrown in a bloody rebellion based upon a huge lie that lyanna had been kidnapped wasnt the rebellion caused when brandon stark walked into kings landing demanding rhaegar come out and die as in a duel resulting in aerys having brandon and rickard stark tortured to death causing ned and robert to rebel but i agree that people seem to keen to buy into the whole rightful king thing based only on blood when the show doesnt exactly support that as a good system of government "
"503" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-22 " id be very interested to hear from the producers why they decided to write in the rape scene it definitely wasnt in the book and im not sure it fits with jamies current character arc at all without going into any plot or character details which might be spoilers for nonbook readers i think its a pivotal scene for cersei and especially jaime marking the point at which jaime realises how manipulative cersei is and cersei realises how weak jaime is or at least perceives this it undercuts the last 12 episodes of growing redemption for jaime of course but thats our fault for thinking he was a nice guy after all "
"504" "ColiasCroceus" 2014-04-22 " two brief thoughts regarding the hound  firstly they reminded us of the importance of hospitality and walder freys actions just before the hound breached hospitality himself that may come back to haunt him secondly he mentioned the idea of leaving westeros and joining the second sons the idea of the hound joining team khaleesis mob rather appeals although at this rate her elite seem to be growing into the got answer to the magnificent seven  seven samurai "

"507" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-22 " no i think youre right although it is without question a rape the writers have left a little bit of ambiguity about cerseis side of things i wonder if the reason they made it so explicitly a rape its less clear cut in the book is that they didnt want to get into trouble for suggesting no can mean yes "

"509" "DiamondDag" 2014-04-22 " for anyone that might not have seen this and are interested martin has given his thoughts on the jaimecersei scene i think the “butterfly effect” that i have spoken of so often was at work here in the novels jaime is not present at joffrey’s death and indeed cersei has been fearful that he is dead himself that she has lost both the son and the father lover brother and then suddenly jaime is there before her maimed and changed but jaime nonetheless though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and cersei is fearful of discovery she is as hungry for him as he is for her the whole dynamic is different in the show where jaime has been back for weeks at the least maybe longer and he and cersei have been in each other’s company on numerous occasions often quarreling the setting is the same but neither character is in the same place as in the books which may be why dan  david played the sept out differently but that’s just my surmise we never discussed this scene to the best of my recollection also i was writing the scene from jaime’s pov so the reader is inside his head hearing his thoughts on the tv show the camera is necessarily external you don’t know what anyone is thinking or feeling just what they are saying and doing if the show had retained some of cersei’s dialogue from the books it might have left a somewhat different impression — but that dialogue was very much shaped by the circumstances of the books delivered by a woman who is seeing her lover again for the first time after a long while apart during which she feared he was dead i am not sure it would have worked with the new timeline that’s really all i can say on this issue the scene was always intended to be disturbing… but i do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons its also interesting how the people directly involved with the scene all apparently came away from it with different views "
"510" "glitterfairy11" 2014-04-22 " i dont think theres any question that what we saw on screen was rape she said no he ignored her and this is much closer to the book version than i actually remembered i went back to the book and found the scene and you missed a crucial part from your quote above she pounded on his chest with feeble fists muttering about the risk the danger about their father about the septons about the wrath of the gods he never heard her he undid his breeches and climbed up and pushed her bare white legs apart one hand slid up her thigh and underneath her smallclothes when he tore them away he saw that her moons blood was on her but it made no difference this is not what consent looks like i know that what immediately follows is the passage you quoted but now ive really paid attention to the scene i find it much more problematic and distasteful which i think according to grrm is how were meant to feel httpio9comgeorgerrmartinrespondstothatcontroversialgame1565762209utmcampaignsocialflowio9twitterutmsourceio9twitterutmmediumsocialflow his relevant quote there the scene was always intended to be disturbing "
"511" "discoveryofslood" 2014-04-22 " it had its good moments particularly with tywinred viper and tyrionpod but stannis sam and aryas scenes were all some of the more obvious filler the series has put on screen and i was unconvinced of the need to ride to crasters keep leaving the wall even more thinly garrisoned when the wildlings are obviously going to attack castle black no matter what the turncloaks tell them "
"512" "DutchDon" 2014-04-22 " though easy to miss i think that scene was very significant definitely made me jump up and shout hahif the iron bank decides its time for a regime change i think stannis might be their ideal candidate certainly seems the type of guy able to maintain a strict budget i bet hed rather eat book soup than go into debt the iron library doesnt have veto right does it also worth noting last weeks conversation between tywin and olennaot wars are rather expensivethe iron bank will have its duetl how they love to remind everyoneot almost as much as you lannisters with your debtstl im not worried about the iron bankot we both know youre smarter than thatwe all know he is sounds though like he has something up his sleeve cant wait to find out what it is and lets not forget littlefinger as the former master of coin hes largely responsible for the treasurys troublesome state at the very least he must have been aware of it long before anyone else didnt seem the least bit troubled by it might have even deliberately caused it no doubt it somehow fits perfectly into his game of chaos and ladders "
"513" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-22 " by the way sarah im disappointed joel fry leighton from trollied didnt get random brit of the week "
"514" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-04-22 " bit slow this week although raping your twin sister beneath the dead body of the lunatic spawn of your incestuous union is probably a first for british tv unless hollyoaks have already done it i think the writers are struggling a bit to get everybody where they need to be for the next series of major developments to make it all work on tv hardly surprising given that grrm basically had to give up writing selfcontained novels because he couldnt control the story anymore "
"515" "discoveryofslood" 2014-04-22 " cant say i agree with that theres no getting around his very clear betrayal of ned i was never that sure about how close littlefinger came to backing ned at that point there were certain conversations that seemed to indicate that he gave up on him after realising how incompetent a strategist ned was and that it would be a massive risk to take his side "
"516" "Simgeo" 2014-04-22 " i think also theres a telling scene with cersei and joffrey in season 1 after hes been attacked by aryas direwolf on the kings road cersei tries to convince him that he bravely slew the beast and theres a brief moment where you see him try to challenge her and accept the truth of the situation and his own cowardice but she starts working on him with the world will be whatever you want it to be spiel joffrey may have been a psycho anyway but hes a definite example of larkins line about they fuck you up your mum and dad they dont mean to but they do "
"517" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-04-22 " and if it does trump sword and shield how will it fair against warg whitewalker and dragon "
"518" "Simgeo" 2014-04-22 " her brother viserys may have had a point when he said of drogo hes marching the wrong way with my army now his sister is continually marching the wrong way with her own army "
"519" "ColiasCroceus" 2014-04-22 " im not sure what to make of thorne he really dislikes jon and hes not a nice guy but unlike slint whos a spineless treacherous buffoon thorne seems to have the survival of the watch as his aim if his aims coincide with jons they might actually have to work together "
"520" "Pepa01" 2014-04-22 " im tired of cheap sex scenes intended for audience masturbation and cheap violence scennes intended for exactly the same torture incest and rape i guess next season will be child sex abuse i think the quality of this series is going down "
"521" "ColiasCroceus" 2014-04-22 " im wondering if the accent shift is deliberate  i think this is the first time weve seen him in a place thats not kings landing doesnt have nobles and doesnt have varyss spies lurking is this a glimpse of the real littlefinger a bit less artificial than the accent he adopts when dealing with powerful families and old money at court "
"522" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-22 " i thinks the brits viewers notice the accents more than northamericans and maybe its part of the character too you never know with him what his intents are what hes going to sound like or act hes a snake i quite enjoy gillens performance "
"523" "ZeloLad" 2014-04-21 " watching the episode again i think you are right he seems to be dressed in elite clothing not slaves clothing and he had nice hair "
"524" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-04-21 " i think hes only really protecting her as he knows how valuable she is as a non dead stark child he might be giving her overly lustful looks but i think littlefingers top priority is always politicalstrategical value "
"525" "EnglishDisco" 2014-04-21 " nah theres still some ambiguity most of the mainstream is jumping straight on the fact that this was rape black and white and that this was a major deviation on second watch i think its not so black and white its very grey theyre such a dysfunctional couple theyve been together for over 20 years cersei is the only woman jaime has ever been with midway through the uncomfortable scene shes returning his kiss and her hands seem to be fumbling at his clothes as they go down on their knees now im not saying it makes for comfortable viewing but i dont think its open and shut rape i think cerseis character was torn but gives in all they had to do was add a little bit of dialogue on cerseis part to take away any ambiguity  but they obviously thought long and hard over it and decided they preferred the debate "
"526" "Owakahnige" 2014-04-21 " ive said it below but going to repeat it stannis claim to the throne is not that great heretic you will burn in the purifying pyre of the lord of light for your blasphemy stannis is the one true king azor ahai reborn and destined to defeat the great other for it is prophesied that when the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers azor ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone for the night is dark and full of terrors "
"527" "discoveryofslood" 2014-04-21 " she should stop trying to be queen of the eastern lands and cross the narrow sea its called narrow it cant be that big ugh to be fair she would have to cross slavers bay and half a continent to even reach the narrow sea and she doesnt have any ships "
"528" "Knight_2359" 2014-04-21 " from this interview with the director httpwwwvulturecom201404gameofthronesdirectorontherapesexscenehtmlmidtwittervulture it seems that the scene was supposed to be consensual and not some drastic change in jaimes character arc but in translating this from script to screen and having not read the scene in the book the director seems to have made a hash of it not sure what to make of this then for future episodes  just forget we saw this and pretend it happened like in the book "
"529" "Rence" 2014-04-21 " little finger benefits from chaosmitsbin his interest to keep everyone else fighting as long as he is not directly involved himself everyone else gets weaker he gets stronger in relative terms as he can stay ahead of the game nothing littlefinger is the only player that varys respects the only one that he actually worries about didnt he also say something about littlefinger being willing to let the world burn if he got to rule the ashes "
"530" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " too nice like the hound said they wouldnt last winter "
"531" "Rence" 2014-04-21 " she was saying no but she was also responding physically to him i dont want to get into trouble for saying that no can mean yes but she was returning his kisses she was reluctant and massively conflicted but my impression of her reaction was that underneath that she was actually willing "
"532" "Owakahnige" 2014-04-21 " it was interesting to note that tywin is starting to pay attention to the threat from daenerys and her dragons across the sea "
"533" "Knight_2359" 2014-04-21 " it wastrying to remember if any other peep show actors have been in got the only one i could think of was the orgazoid in season 1 as yoren "
"534" "themanlikedave" 2014-04-21 " and ser davos appears to be the only geordie in the land strangely "
"535" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-21 " im sure they mentioned it in the series lancel lannister cerseis lover and roberts squire gave robert stronger wine that he normally drank so robert missed the boar with his spear and was gored always seemed risky to me what if it wasnt fatal get pycelle to let him die like he did robert arryn i suppose "
"536" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " yes thats what i thought "
"537" "rooksx" 2014-04-21 " i suppose they had to put the brakes on after last weeks ep but this was a little dull couldnt care less about sam and gilly their storyline is pretty boring "
"538" "zephirine" 2014-04-21 " aiden gillen cant do accents in the wire he was the only character with an unconvincing voice  even though some of the other characters had their own versions of accents they sounded ok with gillen as carcetti again the irish came and went though never as much as littlefinger this episode and it really detracted from the character imo its surprising that he gets cast in parts that need a different accent youd think directors would know by now but maybe they think its worth it because nobody else can do slimy so well "
"539" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " pod is too sweet of a character not to come back eventually i hope we see him again after his kings landing escape "
"540" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " then again maybe we will see that next episode them in postcoital mood with their dead son corpse just there at least the writers made us discuss what is rape thats a good thing "
"541" "EnglishMike" 2014-04-21 " no spoilers but the show has been tracking pretty closely with the book where daenerys storyline is concerned "
"542" "RWizzle" 2014-04-21 " wow the books sound shit "
"543" "EnglishMike" 2014-04-21 " incest only increases the risk of inheriting genetic detects it doesnt guarantee them apparently tommen got lucky "
"544" "JimboBrennan" 2014-04-21 " not a fan of the wire then "
"545" "jodave" 2014-04-21 " triple meow and i raise you a phwoargh "
"546" "grandcanalman" 2014-04-21 " tywin was especially good in this episode at his avuncular best with tommen whilst cersei looked on shocked even oberyn looked a little intimidated in his presence "
"547" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " davos was a smuggler you need wits to be one and last and become eventually hand of the king "
"548" "ID0334209" 2014-04-21 " ah yeah sorry i read it wrong thanks for clarifying "
"549" "jellybeens" 2014-04-21 " what was with aiden gillens accent he has great presence just not convinced thats all it take to warrant his rep as a great actor "
"550" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " please dont "
"551" "Clariana" 2014-04-21 " i also agree i believe other commentators are missing just what jaime has been through hes been on the front line hes been held a prisoner for other a year he was beaten mutilated and humiliated in ways no other member of his family except perhaps tyrion has ever experienced he goes back home and what his father is still attempting to manipulate his his sister now despises him tells him he was away for too long as if he was on holiday not justification just explanation "
"552" "dsk84" 2014-04-21 " this is speculation on my part but the targaryans tended to veer between madness and greatness partially due to their incest limited gene pool and all similarly joffrey seemed to get the worst of the lannister genes while the other two didnt "
"553" "ID0334209" 2014-04-21 " syrio was the foremost thought in my mind when davos said that "
"554" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " and olenna last week said in her private walk with tywin to be careful of all those war debts the lannisters have "
"555" "Clariana" 2014-04-21 " you get a little more background on joff in the books and well joff was always bad probably a psycho tommen and myrcella are normal so far "
"556" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " in my mind cersei planned roberts hunting accident i havent read the books and it was never clear on tv but she did it oh yes she did "
"557" "Clariana" 2014-04-21 " i also think that a possible explanation within the context of the series is that at this stage jaime knows his flush is busted his father doesnt want him cersi no longer desires him he is no longer one of the most outstanding or fairest knights in the kingdom its goodbye to all that time "
"558" "Sebadono" 2014-04-21 " map shop convo furthering yet again the best double act on screen just now never really sags with so much to go round and check up on no mourning afters when theres new schemes to be spun quality stuff as always even in the lesser action focused episodes "
"559" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " i didnt find anything sexy about this rape at all the corpse of their dead son was right there its difficult to understand why you would find this rape worse than all the other rapes and murders and worse weve already seen in got "
"560" "AlexJVC" 2014-04-21 " i am talking specifically about the seven kingdoms and the northsouth divide of which i think having a northernsouthern accent divide is quite fair enough accents aside from that i am not too fussed accents in general in all honesty but i think it is a nice touch having a deliberate northsouth accent divide god knows what has happened to littlefingers accent to be honest it is a mess "
"561" "shima" 2014-04-21 " just watched this and while i found the jaimecersei scene tricky i did wonder if they had played with those type of scenarios between them at points in their relationship in the past "
"562" "adamabyss" 2014-04-21 " aiden gillen has changed his accent from previous seasons quite bizarrely  so much for continuity "
"563" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " thats what i think too "
"564" "candylilacs" 2014-04-21 " i dont think so she deserves to be imprisoned and forced to live as the small folk that would be the worst kind of torture for her this whole part of the series is about cersei slowly going paranoidmad because she has no power and doesnt know who to trust anymorethe rape added nothing for me "
"565" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " it sure looked like rape i think they filmed it that way to show how broken this couple is now "
"566" "Thulcandra" 2014-04-21 " well after her we at the poker tables his wife could buy him the iron throne pfft casterly rock schmasterly rock congrats to victoria coren "

"568" "dsk84" 2014-04-21 " especially since she just minutes earlier was pleading with jaime to murder their brother surely that was as reprehensible if not more "
"569" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " oh yes he was hot as hell in qaf meow "
"570" "Clariana" 2014-04-21 " good point but thats exactly how the nw are at this stage of their history its a true lowpoint whereas the wildings appear to be getting their act together under a charismatic leader lets not forget motivation for the wildings it is either get their shit together or face extermination whereas the nw has been neglected for at least a few decades by the rest of westeros and most of its members now do not now give a fig about their original mission "
"571" "elleesse" 2014-04-21 " how come tommen is well normal polite wellmannered because the making a joffrey incest genes didnt kick in with him or that he was deemed only 2nd in line for the throne and therefore not so important for mommy dearest to be paying so much attention to his pliability and politeness seem weirdly out of place within that family of his "
"572" "candylilacs" 2014-04-21 " are you kidding i remembered him from shanghai nights and circle of friends took me a while thoughhes much grayer "
"573" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-21 " no what i was referring to was that littlefinger told catelyn it was tyrions knife that the assassin used so he has form in trying to set tyrion up "
"574" "DetachNgo" 2014-04-21 " the death of joffrey has created chaos chaos is a ladder that baelish likes to climb "
"575" "Clariana" 2014-04-21 " ok so perhaps now hes totally in control and not in kl perhaps he feels he can speak more naturally like many arrivistes it is possible that kl lf was talking posh to get on "
"576" "ardeleanu" 2014-04-21 " if youre fans ofstop attacking stannis  "
"577" "ardeleanu" 2014-04-21 " because jaime thought cersei actually wanted it "
"578" "DetachNgo" 2014-04-21 " i dont know if this story decision would have been taken withougt grrms consent maybe he was the one that said it was rape from cerseis point of view pov "
"579" "Midwinter" 2014-04-21 " it may just be that after three seasons of inaction her storyline actually went somewhere "
"580" "elleesse" 2014-04-21 " thank you was trying to place exactly where i remembered him from know hes been in other things but queer as folk were i can visually place him "
"581" "ID0334209" 2014-04-21 " its reasonable to presume petyr had some knowledge of joffreys impending death and also fair to presume that his is the mischievous hand behind the settingup of tyrion not least because hes done it before with catelyn and the attempted assassination of bran in season one but is he the actual brains behind the poisoning sarah you think littlefinger tried to have bran killed i always presumed it was as is supposed in the books i forget which character suspects it sorry if people consider this a spoiler or a cryptic spoiler not my intent also the final shot was a bit i dunno lacking anyone else feel that maybe because last weeks was so wtf "
"582" "Midwinter" 2014-04-21 " yep though id assumed hed made it back ahead of jon snow for some reason "
"583" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-21 " yes i love dolorous edd "
"584" "dsk84" 2014-04-21 " yep he was even got into a misguided duel with ned starks elder brother i think he tried to employ similar tactics to what bronn did in the eyrie only difference was that bronn was a competent enough fighter to pull it off "
"585" "Aelfwine" 2014-04-21 " sansas flight from the vipers nest no offense to oberyn that is kings landing had me much more elated than i expected "
"586" "DetachNgo" 2014-04-21 " she gave a great speech i thought as the breaker of chains "
"587" "dsk84" 2014-04-21 " fair enough and i do see a where it is going just that they show too little of her and what they do just seems familiar in brans case however i wouldnt mind if they skipped it altogether as it just seems so dull "
"588" "Midwinter" 2014-04-21 " based on grr martins form to date i have a theory that dany will be shockingly killed on the eve of sailing for kings landing and that her dragons will go on a rampage across the sea mind you sometimes it seems the only fitting end for the series will be a slow pan through every location seen to date smothered in snow corpses in the streets ending on a shot of three dragons roaring across a lifeless land "
"589" "ardeleanu" 2014-04-21 " so tempted to say something "
"590" "daboiy" 2014-04-21 " her scenes are part of her wider plot that will develop though i agree with your comment and thought about it with regards the book and i think what they are doing with her at the moment makes sense so long as they develop it soonish "
"591" "ardeleanu" 2014-04-21 " great scene with tommen and tywin "
"592" "ardeleanu" 2014-04-21 " its going to be boring with khaleesi until and show up  "
"593" "CaptainEllie" 2014-04-21 " bets on how long david mitchell would survive in westeros "
"594" "Dryhtscipe" 2014-04-21 " yeah those meekly compliant illeducated perpetually frightened women are much more likeable than the powerful increasingly confident ones who say have dragons and free slaves "
"595" "jimmy_mac" 2014-04-21 " i think the daario scene was particularly badass and i disagree respectfully with those who opine that the dany storyarc is too repetitious and boring in my opinion many of the highlights of the series involve her story from viserys’s death to her birthing of the dragons to her visions in the house of the undying to her amassing an army of unsullied right up to her casting the barrels of broken collars into the walls of mereen great stuff i think i also think she’ll be a formidable force to reckon with for those seeking to hold the iron throne assuming she gets her army to king’s landing and that the place hasn’t already been overrun and sacked by whitewalkers and wildlings and winter and evil spirits and black magic and the like "
"596" "Dryhtscipe" 2014-04-21 " no its really not there are parallels and similarities but its not a version of those events or of england or any other location for that matter and as someone else pointed out westeros is rather larger  about the size of south america iirc "

"600" "randombloke" 2014-04-21 " you just know shes gonna fall for the first man who doesnt hit on her probably the knight of the flowers "
"601" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-21 " yes absolutely and i touched on that briefly in the post with the bit about the transgressive nature of their relationship im just not entirely convinced that they pulled it off if that was their intention which i think it may have been "
"602" "Thisusernameistaken7" 2014-04-21 " me too boo it undermines the whole story line about jamie saving brienne from rape which then ultimately costs him his hand which shows him to be complex and honorable turning this scene into rape was unnecessary it was done purely to exploit the conflict that sexy rape throws up did she want it lets fill internet threads with discussion bleep you got "
"603" "Alat41" 2014-04-21 " perhaps its the same producers that decided it was necessary to hire porn stars to play the prostitutes if indeed that is true i wouldnt have liked the storyline if ggrm had written it either but to see rape casually thrown in as some kind of useful plot arc by a character who last season made a strong stand against it is appalling it is just a tv show but if rape is not in the books  why on earth would you choose to put it in "
"604" "raeofsunshine" 2014-04-21 " i also love pod pod and davos to rule the seven kingdoms please "

"608" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-21 " well the kingdoms is meant to be a version of england the whole north and south thing meant to be a reworking of the war of the roses i know what you mean though i think that it is much less straight forward than that for one thing westeros is much larger than great britain but still picture someone growing up poor somewhere on the coast of england out in the middle of nowhere coming to court and trying to speak in rp while rubbing shoulders with old etonians odds are that hes not going to quite pull it off "
"609" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-21 " im with you on this i would care a great deal about that i think pyp clearly does hence his quote "

"611" "Mark222" 2014-04-21 " the problem with khaleesi is her enemies they are usually both unambiguously villainous and hilariously inept occasionally moreso than ex king joffrey "
"612" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-21 " interesting point re cersei and perfectionimperfection i actually meant it more basically  i think shes someone who places value on appearances she likes the fact that jaime and her were twins thats part of the appeal part of her hatred of tyrion i feel is driven by the fact hes so conspicuously not perfect in looks a one handed jaime is no longer perfect hence no longer worthy of her love that said i really like your suggestion about the idea of imperfection made visible "
"613" "rickyredmanc" 2014-04-21 " no no im fine "

"674" "Aelfwine" 2014-04-21 " the rape was jamie brutally ending his relationship with cersei and demonstrating she could no longer control him with sex really now hes a grown man and he was in a consensual relationship with her before then blaming his previous actions the attempted murder of bran and especially the rape on cersei is bloody disgusting "
"675" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-21 " mine too its a very clever threat carefully delivered "
"676" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-21 " i didnt say that the rape was the line being crossed i said that the character crossed a line in raping his sister because you know as a character i think he did she told him to stop he didnt im not saying it shouldnt have been there as a storyline im saying that it will be a botched storyline if there arent repercussions from it i thought that was pretty clear and while were on the subject of torture we discussed the theonramsay storyline in quite a lot of detail last season because that was another one walking a fine line between important character development and gratuitous dwelling on a mans subjugation and pain i think theres nothing wrong with tackling these subjects but if you do so then you have to be careful that its within character and organic to the storyline in the case of jaime and cersei i think it was  as i mentioned above its easy to see how jaime gets to this point and easy to see why he crosses the line he crosses however if it then becomes a random event that is never referred to again or retconned away then the show in my opinion has a problem "
"677" "candylilacs" 2014-04-21 " i didnt like the rape scene either it should have had much more explanation and jaimes choice of joffreys displayed body was just odd i dont know its like it was shorthand writing as or it becomes consensual i was looking for that and toward the end she was still pushing him off of her and hitting him it didnt seem consensual at all to me meanwhile littlefinger is much more creepy and weird but i suppose sansas at least alive and not on trial "
"678" "candylilacs" 2014-04-21 " the only thing im getting out of it the rape scene in the series is that cersei is repulsed by jaime and his hand  aside from grief  so the angry rape is about her not wanting him in the book she was similarly repulsed but just managed to stay out of his way a lot and in the book she was banging quite a few guys "
"679" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-21 " see this is my problem with it  which i touched on above  i had a horrible feeling that they wanted us to take that away from it on the grounds that their relationship is transgressive and based on odd power games anyway but i dont think it worked at all to be honest i think people should always be pretty wary about presenting any scene that starts off as rape as then becoming consensual "
"680" "Midwinter" 2014-04-21 " the scene between pod and tyrion was a rather unexpected tearjerker i thought "
"681" "candylilacs" 2014-04-21 " yes i would be worried about littlefinger if i were sansa is he better than joffrey not by much "
"682" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-21 " well it becomes consensual by the end because anything for them ultimately results in a turnon especially a power struggle nobody really wanted to talk about what was going on between the two characters so we had a rehearsal that was a blocking rehearsal and it was very much about the earlier part with charles dance and the gentle verbal kidnapping of cerseis last living son nikolaj came in and we just went through one physical progression and digression of what they went through but also how to do it with only one hand because it was nikolaj by the time you do that and you walk through it the actors feel comfortable going home to think about it the only other thing i did was that ordinarily you rehearse the night before and i wanted to rehearse that scene four days before so that we could think about everything and it worked out really well thats one of my favorite scenes ive ever done so according to the director its actually meant to be consensual in the end failed to show that in the opinion of pretty much everyone who saw it if in the next episode cersei and jamie are shown being all devoted wont it look rather well apologist "
"683" "PleasepleaseTrina" 2014-04-21 " also interesting to see some evidence of backbone in shireen shes always seemed like a cool little kid  especially given her circumstances  but hearing davos say youre your fathers daughter and no mistake relentless the pair of you made me begin to wonder what she might be capable of as she gets older "
"684" "OyoySavaloy" 2014-04-21 " carcetti as slimy as ever i havent read the books but was disappointed at the rape scene mainly because i was starting to quite like jamie tywin was great as usual charles dance almost always steals the show for me "
"685" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-21 " im trying to think how someone as kind hearted as davos has managed to survive for so long must be because hes smarter than he looks and to some extent people would underestimate him i dont know how many years he was a smuggler but hes been stannis only friend for at least fifteen years and i doubt people cross stannis very often "

"690" "CentralBelter" 2014-04-21 " erm because its about how theyre represented on screen and in any case sarah wasnt suggesting a line had been crossed in the representation but that the director and actors were very careful to show that jaime crossed a line worth reading more carefully and in any case it was an episode where rape was mentioned quite a lot with different attitudes being shown  the show does these multiple perspectives pretty well "

"706" "randombloke" 2014-04-21 " my reading of it would be that jaime would be a pretty stand up guy except when it comes to cersei that is not to blame cersei for jaimes actions in any way  shes a nasty piece of work but hes responsible for what he does  but rather to point out that she is his weakness and his actions not relating to her are generally defensible "

"712" "Debsta81" 2014-04-21 " after the first two episodes of this season were so strong i was really surprised with how terrible this episode was it started off well with sansa finally escaping kings landing but poor girl has jumped from the frying pan into the fire littlefinger was so creepy it was nice to have him back tywin and tommen scene was wonderful tommen learnt more about kingship in those 5 minutes than joffrey grasped in his entire lifetime also loved davos scenes your father lacks an appreciation for the finer points of bad behaviourwas my line of the night everything else was rubbish thought the dialogue was very ordinary the jaime and cersei scene was a massive mistep their story arc in the book is perfect dont mess with it same with the castle black scenes which are the focus of the end of the third book and we spend most of that time on sam and gilly making doe eyes at each other boring i think we are in for a few episodes of super slow moving plot lines as they drag out the remains of book three for the rest of this season the one deviation from the books i would like to see is someone killing off danaerys immediately and take out smug daario with her too they belong together in seven hells "
"713" "hexatu" 2014-04-21 " game of thrones has these lower intensity epidoses i actually look forward to them as they usually add more depth to the storylines and dont make every episode some mega plot drama which is equally tiring over a whole season i just thought the ending was a bit feeble for once and also a bit of a mixed message if i understood it right youll be freed  in death "
"714" "hexatu" 2014-04-21 " no problem with any accent he chooses though full out texan might be a bit weird in westeros the problem is that his accent was literally changing mid sentence in last nights scene a bit distracting trying to pin down which part of irelanddorsetthe channel islandstasmania we were in other than that he was even more excellently loathsome than usual not nice to have back which i suppose is the point "
"715" "Debsta81" 2014-04-21 " in the book she goes from not here its not right to do me now jaime pretty damn quick and afterwards she says they must be more careful in future i dont think it would change too much if we saw it from cerseis pov i dont think anyones forgotten what he did in the very first episode but the writers have developed his character to the point where he is rescuing brienne standing up to tywin and now he rapes his sister i dont buy it "
"716" "Dougiedownunder" 2014-04-21 " not read the books so just guessing  dannys moment has to arrive at some point  power currups and absolute power corrupts absolutely three dragons make one overconfident shit will happen agree  rape is rape but let that teach you a lesson about developing empathy for the incestuous kingslayer bad man in series one and a bad man today its hard not to believe that sams protectiveness is an error of judfement difficult not to imagine that for gilly somethng wicked her way comes i am not comfortable in the presence of the bald guy who eats parents just saying  you know  stannis is losing it  big time others will pay oh yes  and a point about last week that moment reek paused in the shave theon awoke that awakening will not end happily for quite a few folk ill bet "
"717" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-21 " no reason why a warg couldnt but then dragons are thought to be very intelligent independent creatures more like humans so much more difficult to control and as jojen says of brans abilities when he wargs hodor there is nobody anywhere that can do that so it may be that no warg until now has had the ability to do so "
"718" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " bran is a wargintraining maybe hes just not powerful enough for now to get into dragons heads also interesting that tywin went to oberyn knowing they are the only ones in dorne of the 7 kingdoms who kinda know how to fight dragons and tywin is very aware those dragons and their mother are real now and a menace to take very seriously "
"719" "dsk84" 2014-04-21 " as per your question as i realised i didnt actually answer it bran is probably too far to be able to warg into a dragon and that may well have been the case when the dragons invaded  there just werent enough or any wargs that were capable of controlling them "
"720" "dsk84" 2014-04-21 " im not 100 sure but wargs are more common north of the wall as they seem to be more accepted by the wildlings they were less common south of the wall as people were skeptical of them so they may well have been reduced further due to a more limited gene pool of people carrying the warg gene if that even is a thing the north of the wall part is legit i got that from the season 3 blue ray i sort of put my own spin on the rest "
"721" "Debsta81" 2014-04-21 " totally agree with you it doesnt fit at all especially considering how jaime lost hand trying to protect brienne from being raped in season 3 sometimes the straying from the books works and sometimes it doesnt and of all of grrms material to stray from the second half of a storm of swords is not it its perfect the way it is "
"722" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " olenna said to margeary that the lannister alliance is still going even with with joffrey dead tywin tells the new king that they must find him a bride sowe can expect a tommen and margeary wedding soon enough but weddings are so dangerous in got but then the rivalry between marg and cersei would go on hurrah "
"723" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-21 " quite but the drama was in seeing him hustled out from under his mothers wing while she stood silent in a state of shock the tail end of the conversation was telling tywin isnt just positioning himself as the power behind the throne hes getting ready to marry him off and keep the tyrell alliance intact i thought his scene with oberyn was more interesting if he believes a seat on the small council will be enough to satisfy the most insatiable man in the seven kingdoms he has made a huge miscalculation "
"724" "dsk84" 2014-04-21 " wonder how much of that is down to the quality of the actors playing roles in kings landing in the books jon snow around this time had a very interesting arc but we havent really had much buildup around it whereas a lot of screen time is giving to tywin and olenna who certainly arent as big characters as dany or jon but quite possibly due to their ability as actors they just seem to be getting a lot more time and they may well seem to make more of the time they are given than the younger ones arya aside "
"725" "rickylee369" 2014-04-21 " no wargs this week still i have to wonder if bran is capable of taking over the bodies of animals and even humans then why cant he inhabit a dragon more to the point why couldnt a warg have controlled them back in the day settling the whole rightful king stuff before it got started i dare not look this up elsewhere as i do not want spoilers from the books "
"726" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-21 " actually it does and as others have pointed out its not really a departure from the book more a change of perspective my reading of it is that jamie has now seen that cersei sexually manipulated him into killing whoever she wanted over the years and he went along with it because he loved her and believed she loved him in his own fucked up way he was honourable to cersei all his life now he knows that she doesnt love him anymore if ever the rape was jamie brutally ending his relationship with cersei and demonstrating she could no longer control him with sex in a way that a man of his violent disposition understands "
"727" "ktcnz1" 2014-04-21 " ok no one else has mentioned it so im wondering if ive hallucinated but did one of those slaves look a lot like gendry ive watched it several times and im not convinced either way although i do admit it is unlikely considering we last saw him in a tiny boat unable to swim or navigate great blog and i love the commentsive been lurking for a very long time indeed "
"728" "dsk84" 2014-04-21 " oberyns accent does make sense though well need to see more of dorne to really know but as a book reader dorne always came across as moorish spain to me though when you think about it littlefingers accent totally makes sense as well the character is someone who isnt particularly highborn and is constantly trying to make people ignore or get past where hes from only natural for people like that to have dodgy accents "
"729" "Gantsara" 2014-04-21 " i thought it was out of character tywin doesnt do arguing his case or convincing people something is a good idea he just does it and gets his way through sheer force of personality so with tommen we would just assume the role of advisor and quietly dominate the boy and let it be understood he is the main decision maker "
"730" "dsk84" 2014-04-21 " certainly my own grandmother was married at 14 and that was just over 60 years ago though ill probably leave it there as i dont want to picture anything id rather not but certainly marriages for military alliances were common and from our context is hard to judge drogos acceptance of dany is certainly something that can be seen in a positive light from our eyes however something like viserys telling dany that hed happily let every member of drogos army rape her if it gets him the army he wants would be seen as cold however you look at it "
"731" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-21 " i pay attention to her usually around episode 7 when her plot line becomes relevant again "
"732" "Gantsara" 2014-04-21 " as i mentioned elsewhere on this thread the story at the wall should be a lot more exciting than the series makes it as a book reader i found it far more exciting than all the kings landing goings on the series does the character interactions well and all the back stabbings and bitchiness but it flounders at the more traditional fantasy adventure type story lines "
"733" "MrMsyvc" 2014-04-21 " the whole samgilly bit doesnt make sense to me sam fears for her safety so he puts her and the baby up at the slimiest brothel in the seven kingdoms does not compute "
"734" "dsk84" 2014-04-21 " yeah imagine going through what you think is a rescue only to end up in littlefingers hands even sansa shouldnt be naive enough to be pleased with that i was talking to my cousins wife about littlefinger and she was questioning his sanity i told her that his sanity isnt the issue its his morals hes very in control of everything he does almost to the extent that its scary if i were in westeros hed easily be in the top 3 people id most be worried on getting on the wrong side of "
"735" "AlexJVC" 2014-04-21 " well the kingdoms is meant to be a version of england the whole north and south thing meant to be a reworking of the war of the roses "
"736" "Catch22" 2014-04-21 " i am getting a bit bored of daenerys stormborn wilberforce and what is with littewanderingaccent it is ridiculous if i was sansa id have laughed in his face after the shock had subsided cant believe i was made to feel sorry for cersei "
"737" "NewTech_News" 2014-04-21 " weak episode tbh the gilly and sam story is not interesting enough to justify 2 scenes covering about 7 minutes of air time dany really doesnt need to be in most episodes especially if there is no dragon action to be had littlefinger queen of thorns tywin and oberyn awesome everyone else is meh at the minute "
"738" "AlexJVC" 2014-04-21 " i havent read the books enough said "
"739" "Catch22" 2014-04-21 " and change dress does she even do that i cant remember anything but the blue dress "
"740" "DiamondDag" 2014-04-21 " lord littlefinger of the wandering accent had to laugh at that at some point youd think the show would tell aidan gillen to just play the bloody part in his own accent and be done with it it was practically there this episode anyway good to have him back though despite the accent i think hes grown into the character all the best stuff this episode definitely came about from the fallout in kings landing having an older tommen is going to create some interesting changes in the story i wont dwell on but boy tywin didnt waste any time manipulating him he hasnt even been crowned yet and cersei had to watch another of her children taken away from her id almost feel sorry for her if she wasnt such an awful awful human being obviously that didnt make it any easier to see her become the victim of jaimies frustrations i was surprised that scene was kept but also thought it was more consensual in the books although i might be wrong i think making it more explicitly an act of rape left no doubt about jaimies transgression hes not quite the reformed character he was trying to be as for arya and the hound i said last season that theyve been careful not to turn sandor into an antihero and theyve continued that this season in the first episode he got plenty of cheers from me for the way he didnt take any shit from polliver and his men he was full of quips and one liners then they brilliantly undercut all that by showing what a cold bastard he is that line about having a code was completely empty he isnt a man to be cheered i mean i just understand the way things are how many starks they got to behead before you figure it out daario naharis is nowhere near as cool as he dany and the shows writers think he is spot on he could have been but they wimped out on depicting him as something exotic theyre a world away from westeros but he looks like he should be tramping around farmers fields with arya and the hound even jorah has a bit of colour on him daario is just this drab brown lump i also had to pour one out for strong belwas that fraud daario took your glory "
"741" "cybersuperhero" 2014-04-21 " quick question is the guy who plays pyp the same guy who mugs mark in an underpass david mitchell in season 3 of the peep show "
"742" "Gantsara" 2014-04-21 " a big problem with the series is that they have done the north story line quite poorly with the result that most viewers seem mainly just fixed on kings landing based on comments here and elsewhere dont want to be a bore about the books but the story at the wall up to this point was gripping and tense with the apparent threat of the wildlings coming from south and north and behind everything the lurking menace of the white walkers and a sense of time running out when reading the book storm of swords i even rushed through reading all the chapters about the north first before going back to kl red wedding etc the series is getting a bit better with the castle black scenes and the more assertive jon snow but the depiction of the wildlings and especially the white walkers so far has been very meh so the damage is done and lost the viewers interest "
"743" "bzz77" 2014-04-21 " well yes her story is about marching winning hearts and minds and conquest right now it is not true that that is all she did last season last season she went from survival mode to conquest mode this season she is more established and the dragons are starting to show signs of independence i would hate it if we had to deal with extended repetitive conquest scenes and scenes of competition between her advisors but we dont this week as previously with many of danys scenes over the seasons the conquest came right at the end of the episode we didnt see her at all last week the last big conquest scene was last season so if orpheusliar stops paying attention heshe is unlikely to miss anything major anyway i think that if all youre getting out of these scenes is conquest then youre missing things to me she seems to be becoming increasingly convinced that she is a liberator there are similarities to the situation in iraq "
"744" "ACertainBang" 2014-04-21 " i thought this episode was better than the review credits jaimes turn back to the dark side was typical of the shows flipping of expectations and satisfyingly shocking the hound stealing silver was still very much the character as weve come to know him and didnt make him any less appealing and i especially enjoyed aryas quick thinking cover story gambling that the family whose land they were on had also lost a mother this bodes well for her chances of survival "
"745" "ScotiaNova" 2014-04-21 " talking of shit or rather a shit not given i miss strong belwas    "
"746" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-21 " wellby our standards no but were talking a fantasy world roughly analogous to war of the roses england for that time period marrying off your women at fourteen was perfectly understandable and acceptable drogo would be no worse than any other man of the period and better than most nor would viserys marrying his sister off to gain military support be particularly mentionable then although it seems a horrible thing to do to us now "

"748" "cybersuperhero" 2014-04-21 " tywin having the talk with tommen was also hilarious "
"749" "cybersuperhero" 2014-04-21 " in the books it is most definitely consensual just saying "
"750" "cybersuperhero" 2014-04-21 " so good to have baelish aidan gillen back now theres proper deception and political twofacedness and yes littlefinger is definitely in on it especially with the murder of dontos the importance of him staying silent bit worried for sansa though the way that littlefinger made eyes at her "
"751" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-21 " well exactly "
"752" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-21 " i think littlefinger is a more obviously treacherous character in the tv show although its still difficult to say what hes really up to he never fully shows his hand hes like don king he instigates a fight between two other parties and walks away with the victor to share the spoils hes clearly entering a different phase in his plans now and upping the ante whatever hes up to now its to further his own cause directly rather than by ingratiating himself with somebody else hes not a man who makes bad investments so whatever purposes hes got in mind for sansa will almost certainly benefit him more than it does her poor sansa tyrion might have been the only true friend she had "

"754" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-04-21 " drogo waited about 30 seconds for her consent and in the books dany was 14 years old when her brother sold her to khal drogo what makes it disturbing is that dany is an underage slave forced to have sex with a man twice her age i might be talking from a 21st century nonfantasy mindset but theres nothing consensual about what happened on dany and drogos wedding night "
"755" "jailbreak" 2014-04-21 " completely agree as soon as she starts her five minute intro mother of dragons it goes down hill again if you took all of her bits from the last series and this is literally is march free give speech and change dress "
"756" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-21 " what makes you think things will go better longterm for dany any more than they did say ned stark or his son noone saw what was in store for them coming who wasnt a book reader "
"757" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-21 " ive yet to understand the problem some have with gillens accent hes not supposed to sound english aside from the obvious fact that there is no england in westeros not every accent in westeros is the same ned stark didnt sound anything like the king slayer oberyn doesnt sound anything like tywin theres no reason to think that littlefinger will sound like anyone but littlefinger but if the character does have an affected accent perhaps its because hes tried to consciously improve upon his natural provincial one and if he hasnt fully succeeded then you can just put him down on the same list with most people who never really perfect the accent of their new home "
"758" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-21 " and danys first time with drogo was consensual in the books which considering her age makes it all the more disturbing im not sure i find that more disturbing than the tv series having her violently raped night after night and then falling in love with him makes no sensei understood it in the books drogo waited for consent and was nothing but kind to her after years of abuse at the hands of her halfmad brother its understandable "
"759" "swisschocolate" 2014-04-21 " i do not think or hope it marks a turn in the series but it was definitely a dull episode overall my main problem was that things were superexciting in kings landing and instead of staying there and follow the fallout of joffs death we got several fairly pointless scenes sam  gilly were the worst as i kept thinking they could have saved precious minutes by simply having jon snow ask sam wheres gilly  oh i took her to whatever the towns name was for her safety and as others noted the meereen stuff  dany stuff in general has become repetitive even the arya scenes were not really necessary here most of the interesting stuff happened in kings landing tyrion and pod tywin and tommen and most importantly the potential deal between tywin and oberyn although i could have done without the gratutious nudity youd think hbo had learned from all the scorn heaped on them for that scene in s01 to basically repeat it having oberyn blether about stuff while the two female whores were at it in the background "
"760" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-21 " which brings us to littlefinger the man who puts the mac in machiavelli the only thing more difficult to pin down than his accent are his intentions hes slowly climbing the ladder of chaos even if most of the chaos he exploits is created by his own schemes whatever hes doing with sansa im sure we wont see his next move until long after all his pieces are in place weve missed you lord wogan i think theyve made it too clear too early how dangerous and unscrupulous he is its a pretty jawdropping moment when you find out just what hes been doing when its revealed in the books because all you know of him is hes an easygoing fixer with an insouciant attitude in the series after him telling ros how he allowed a customer to do something godawful to an unwilling prostitute who displeased him and ended up letting ros become a human pincushion never mind the eerie monologues it doesnt have the same oomph or doesnt to me anyway "

"763" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-21 " actually i find her scenes are starting to become the point at which realise nothing more of interest if going to happen this week and i can stop paying attention her particular strand of the story is descending into a song of marching and speeches "
"764" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-04-21 " i think the rape scene is all part and parcel of making cersei more sympathetic if she was portrayed as accurately on television as she is shown in the books especially in her own pov chapters lena headey would get spat at in the streetsperhaps its going to be used as some kind of freudian justification for some of the things shes going to be doing in the future and daario is fairly universally hated by book readers and abysmally corny there too one of those characters martin tried to make cool so failed whilst oberyn was more organic a character who everyone adored cant wait to see if they cast darkstar and crows eye to avoid spoileringfor the next season talk about potential hits and misses "
"765" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-04-21 " slow burn episode with more deviations from the book than we have seen in the preceding 3 series tywin has found a more pliable young boy king to mould in his own image he may be biting off more than he can chew attempting to play a similar game with the red viper though cersei and jamie have almost certainly reached the end game for their creepy manipulative incestuous relationship jon is becoming not just a man of the nights watch but a man in his own right the others look to him as a voice of leadership now even if sers thorne and slynt seem to be forming an alliance against him the hound is far too practical to become a character who becomes a good guy like many of the more intersting characters hes playing his own game with his own rules which brings us to littlefinger the man who puts the mac in machiavelli the only thing more difficult to pin down than his accent are his intentions hes slowly climbing the ladder of chaos even if most of the chaos he exploits is created by his own schemes whatever hes doing with sansa im sure we wont see his next move until long after all his pieces are in place weve missed you lord wogan "

"793" "NZerDan" 2014-04-21 " ha that is the thing with this show they are all selfish pricks the hound is scarred for life physically and mentally but deep down you know there is good him otherwise he would not have offered an escape to sansa looked after arya or defended loras besides next to his brother he is almost squeaky clean i think bronn summed up littlefinger perfectly lord twatbeard would you rather have a beer with the hound at some tavern or a glass of wine with littlefinger at his brothels a few beers and a few chickens with the hound would be quite a night i reckon "
"794" "antimacassartechnolo" 2014-04-21 " i wonder what davos and the little girl is writing to the braavos bank its its for a loan hes gonna have to have one massive sales pitch "
"795" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-04-21 " um spoilers i mean ive read the book but im guessing not everybody else has remember this isnt the first time the show has adapted the events of the books to suit their own narrative jaime strangling his cousin didnt happen in the books and danys first time with drogo was consensual in the books which considering her age makes it all the more disturbing "
"796" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-04-21 " no youre right baelish is worse but the hound is just a selfish prick who believes that everyone else is a selfish prick and thus his actions are justified "
"797" "NZerDan" 2014-04-21 " yeah true but you know what you are getting with the hound and he is getting desperate now littlefinger plays a different game altogether but just as if not crueller example poor lovely ros setting up tyrion betraying ned stark need i go on "
"798" "DMcCool" 2014-04-21 " i havent read the books but from what i gather from the show grrm doesnt exactly do good taste instead he gleefully jumps up and down on top of the raped corpse of decency like a teenage boy who has just discovered when i write a book i can make anything i want happen in it you just have to roll with it and accept it as part of the charm incestonecrorape doesnt even register as offensive in this universe "
"799" "NZerDan" 2014-04-21 " completely disagree we get cersei in affc and she does not even reflect on that with jaime as rape then read her thoughts on robert compared to the ones on jaime and you see who she really hated and loved if it was not obvious on the show anyway remember that jaime and cersei reunite at a different time in the book also hence my lack of understanding why cersei is hating him right now "
"800" "DMcCool" 2014-04-21 " its not just the white savior its the white upper class teenage girl savior in a show that prides itself on political gritty realism danys scenes completely break the suspension of disbelief again and again the logic of the show has no effect on her at all she conquers savage but beautiful wild men with the secret technique of the cowgirl position and has people of all ethnicities cry at her feet when she shows them her superior western values she doesnt just seem like she is from a different series but an entirely different genre "
"801" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-04-21 " the hound just beat a good man half to death in front of his daughter and stole what little they had after they took him in if hes got a code then its a shit one "
"802" "vegeta83" 2014-04-21 " daario is a cheesy matineidol didnt like him in the book seems better in this just not happy with the continuity change him and dany seem to have good chemistry i keep reading people have a problem with dany as the white savior the targs are actually from the eastern continent also in the book they have white slaves as well jorah sold some poachers into slavery but its not feasible to have white extras in morocco the wildings are scariest people in the series so far these is what the brave companions would have been like i wasnt happy with the hound stealing but i can see the point hes changed now oberyn is ok he was cooler in the book tywin teaching tommen was great and its good to actually hear him talk for once maybe rickon will get some lines otherwise they will end up like me at every xmas school play playing the tree or snowman did jaime rape cersei in the book it showed jaimes real emotions and frustrations "
"803" "DMcCool" 2014-04-21 " this is more like it best episode in a long time end of s3 included only downpoint was the truetoform offensively bad dragonbitch segment at the end weve already seen that scene many many times this episode was completely owned by charles dance anyway even tyrion was back on form now he is free from the moping women are such bitches scenes hes been hampered with for over a season we still had to suffer a few more of them with sam but gilly is so much more likeable than most of the female leads so it is totally forgivable "
"804" "EnglishDisco" 2014-04-21 " lol  hes a recurring role in this season a major part in danys storyline "
"805" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-04-21 " a lot of changes made from the book and im kinda surprised that everyone is saying that the jaimecersi scene didnt happen in the book i disagree for those who dont know the chapters in the books are all taken from a certain characters point of view arya is bratty in the sansa chapters while sansa is girly and giggly in the arya chapters as such the jaimecersei sex scene in the books is taken completely from jaimes pov in the book cersei says the same things that she does in the show not here its not right etc before jaime just says to hell with it and starts anyway id imagine if that same scene were taken from cerseis pov it would look a lot like what we saw in this episode saying my reasons for why i think this is what actually happened would be a bit of a spoiler but im interested in how this will affect the multitude of jaime fans whove conveniently forgotten about what he did back in episode 1 "
"806" "EnglishDisco" 2014-04-21 " to date the rape is my biggest problem deviation from the books it just doesnt make sense "
"807" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-04-21 " no jaime did not rape cersei in the book read that scene again and bear in mind its taken completely from jaimes point of view "
"808" "guardiansek" 2014-04-21 " i liked danys episode ending speech and her initial salvo bombarding the slavers city the barrels full of unlocked slave collars but yes the marching followed by males trying to proved their worthiness is getting a little stale i didnt know what to make of cersei and jaime i guess were setting up the end of that relationship as a plot device and littlefinger obviously had some participation in the assassination otherwise he wouldnt be there trying to destabilize the throne and get the tyrells and lannisters suspecting eachother and his interest in sansa is getting creepy but considering his adolescent rejection by catelyn stark maybe this is his way of reliving his youth also i guess that as far as he know sansa is the next stark heir and marrying or coopting her would improve his claim on the norths loyalties "
"809" "NZerDan" 2014-04-21 " rescuing sorry "
"810" "NZerDan" 2014-04-21 " daario bring back last seasons actor sorry the new guy has no swagger no arrogance no charisma the last dude did and all the cheesy lines meant to be making dany blush all he needed was a blue mustachio  gold tooth and he would have been spot on they need to sort out danys story too quick smart its becoming boring needs a kick in the arse littlefinger recuing sansa yeah right we all know what he wants at least the hound has a code "
"811" "ZeloLad" 2014-04-21 " my random brit of the week is joel fry leighton from trollied one of the slaves watching from the wall of mereen "
"812" "NZerDan" 2014-04-21 " no jaime did not rape cersei in the book i still cant get my head around why cersei is rejecting jaime now on the series who apart from lancel where has he gone by the way in s2 has cersei been rooting anyway for her to completely ignore him "
"813" "Michelle Proulx" 2014-04-21 " id be very interested to hear from the producers why they decided to write in the rape scene it definitely wasnt in the book and im not sure it fits with jamies current character arc at all unless theyre planning on using this as a jump off point for a new character arc this season "
"814" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " charles dance was brilliant stealing tommen from cersei over joffreys dead body and then later cersei is raped over joffreys dead body time to burry joffrey cercei "
"815" "travisbicklol" 2014-04-21 " nice palette cleanser after last weeks shenanigans although the khaleesi scenes might as well just be recycled and repeated at this rate and i could do without the insipid involvement of gilly and sam altogether also glad to see jaime lannisters redemption arc getting killed dead like a principle character in an episode nine "
"816" "JonnnyA" 2014-04-21 " i was like they arent going to do it in a church over the corpse of their son  are they cersie pushes him off i laugh out loud i though for a minute they were  wait what  oh shit  they are  he is  no fucking way i kept laughing at the audacity of the scene which was maybe the most bizarre part  why am i laughing at a incestonecrorape  and ive read the books please tell me i didnt somehow miss jamie raping cersei in the sept next to the corpse of their son it would be disturbing if i skimmed the book that somehow didnt stick  though not 100 surprising given the general content of book 3 "
"817" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " littlefinger is part of the murder scheme its obvious now and the way he looked at sansa when she got on the boat was half lust  half fatherly love its was disturbing hes just a snake and aidan gillen is perfect "
"818" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-21 " khaleesi is the best show closer of them all no contest "
