"2" "DrSmurfsGhost" 2011-05-01 " its not a kids show why does it feature them so much because children being in a showmoviestory doesnt make that piece of narrative aimed at childrentherere wolves featured in the show a lot too have you ever tried showing the show to a wolf for one itd be pretty hard to get the creature in the lounge without it mauling your arm off and for two i doubt itd be particularly interested in a screen that means nothing to ityour view point is warped and i cannot understand how you have come to have it "
"3" "EddieLarkin" 2011-04-30 " its not a kids show why does it feature them so much i dont want to put you off but the kids are the main characters well if you count jon and dany as kids as well "

"9" "baffledchump" 2011-04-28 " i havent read the books as a great fan of fantasy stuff i am ashamed to say i hadnt actually heard of them until recently but nevertheless i am enjoying this program more than any other i can remember  just looking at it is fantastic stuff let alone getting to know the customslocationscharactertypes etc that thrones world consists of happily watching each episode twice each week "
"10" "SarahHughes" 2011-04-28 " bezerker please dont hold back say what you really think what a magnificent rant mind you i have to say as someone married to a man from donegal thats got to be the first time anyones ever compared it to tuscany they should put it on their advertising bumf "
"11" "DMcKenzie" 2011-04-28 " sunburst i really enjoyed all the daenerys chapters in all the books in fact they were my favourite parts along with all the tyrion chapters especially in book one where her transformation from a quiet frightened girl into a confident young woman was in my opinion wonderfully portrayed yes well as youve already stated here we should be careful as to say as little about the books as possible so as not to give anything away to anyone who hasnt read them so i will be very very general in what i say here my problem with daenery is that for me she has never felt like a believable or consistent person she is a character who exists in a narrative and finds herself in a series of scenarios where she reacts in a series of ways but there seems very little glue or logic that holds these actions and choices together to create a cohesive person whenever wellwritten examples like tyrion or ned are put in a situation we expect them to react in a certain way and generally they do sometimes they surprise us and do something different but then its always a case of of course that makes perfect sense why didnt i think of that at the end of the day daenery has always felt like a typical female videogame character to me shes hot she has some rather random lesbian tendancies and occcasionally she does something flashy and cool thats really about it i have never felt this has led to a believable or particularly empathisable female protagonist in videogames and i feel precisely the same way about dany "
"12" "Berzerker" 2011-04-28 " thefatcaptain i do think people go over the top in their criticism on these blogs in context of this visualisation i dont think people are even remotely near the top and must keep aiming right up there for the truth which is how unutterably pissweak game of thrones on tv is virtually its harry potter with tits the tits being  in case you missed them the people acting who arent sean bean the costume designer the production designer the location scout doesnt really look epic looks like a tuscan weekend break with saga tours the screenplay adapter the man with the sculpted beard and silly ponytail the laughable fbombs deadwood anyone and wellthe tits huge disappointment "
"13" "hellcat" 2011-04-28 "  sunbursti was tempted to rejoin the discussion of the books but ill resist it seeing as weve been asked to keep it to a minimum in light of this being a blog about the tv series hee consider my wrist slapped a word of praise for the cast i cant think of a seriously duff performance in the bunch i was nervous about nikolaj costerwaldau its the hair man but im rather liking the way he plays jaime hes a cock but theres a melancholy behind his swagger lena headeys doing a fine job as cersei i had chills during the judgement scene as well as her conversation with catelyn "
"14" "Sunburst" 2011-04-27 " i was tempted to rejoin the discussion of the books but ill resist it seeing as weve been asked to keep it to a minimum in light of this being a blog about the tv series ill just say this one tiny thing about daenerys though  the book series isnt finished be patient im certain martin will do something with her to make some of you appreciate her more could happen in the next book even so hang on until 12 july so a tvrelated thought  just saw the preview for episode 3 on hbos website aidan gillen is brilliant as littlefinger and jamie seems to have been given a psychotic side and harry lloyd might go into fits cant wait "
"15" "hellcat" 2011-04-27 " what follows is a discussion of the books dmckenzie the weakest element of the epsiode of course was all the daenary stuff george r r martin is an inventive and refined creator of interesting characters but i cant help but always feel like dany is his one and only utter failure 2dimensional with no real believable motivations for her actions she is the ultimate fantasy of a dd nerd and not much more trust me the cheesy lesbian moments in this episode are by no means the last or the most graphic involving her alot of people here are saying her storyline gets better it doesnt it gets more dramatic certainly but in terms of developing a believable sympathisably character it only gets worse out from here heartily agree i sincerely felt for dany in the beginning and wanted to root for her i mean come on young girl overcoming traumatic and abusive childhood to reclaim her own agency and authority i thought that dany would be my favouritebut as the books went on and grrm becameapparentlyincreasingly enamoured with the character she has been denuded snerk of all personality she is now only a freefloating collection of fetishes white hair disproportionately big boobs lesbian sex check check and check look im not saying that any of this is bad but dany now seems to be a placeholder shes only there to have cool exotic things happen to her "
"16" "Sunburst" 2011-04-27 " i watched the episode again and i have to say the absolute hightlight is tyrions statement about the nights watch to jon lovely thing about the nights watch you discard your old family and get a whole new one priceless  "
"17" "DrSmurfsGhost" 2011-04-27 " just on a minor note  the text of the book explains that the targaryans would wed brother to sister so to keep the bloodline pure so when he undresses dany in episode 1 it technically isnt that creepy as had things been different they would have wed still fairly creepy creepier then kaname and yuki cross at least "
"18" "AngloHybrid" 2011-04-27 " i was just about to mention wilko johnsons appearance but see edmunddantes got there first as soon as i saw him not having read the books i wondered if hed be speaking in his usual canvey island brogue whats that tongue ripped out 20 years ago probably for the best "
"19" "EdmundDantes" 2011-04-27 " i cant believe that no one has picked up on the excellent mute acting from wilko johnson of dr feelgood fame made the episode for me really held it together "
"20" "Wayne123" 2011-04-27 " interesting to see the nonreaders point of views particularly interested in how danys story is being perceived  one or two actually get it without spoiling it  viserys thinks by marrying his sister off to khal drogo that drogo will let him command his army and take back the iron throne dany is a pawn in all of this but doreah roxanne mckee is not just showing dany how to please her man but to take control of him in other ways  now do you think that will just be in the tent at this point in the book i got the impression that dany would become more powerful than her brother  the tv series also gives that impression just on a minor note  the text of the book explains that the targaryans would wed brother to sister so to keep the bloodline pure so when he undresses dany in episode 1 it technically isnt that creepy as had things been different they would have wed "
"21" "sorrison" 2011-04-27 " werthead well there are a lot of people away on holiday so that might explain it as well "
"22" "Werthead" 2011-04-27 " the adjusted ratings will be more telling for that though a combination of great weather and people going out on sundays no work on monday may not have helped to correct myself if thrones had indeed aired on a sunday in the uk this would have been an explanation but since it aired on monday maybe not oops "
"23" "SarahHughes" 2011-04-27 " sunburst  its not the pace or the characterisation i object to although you did make me laugh imagining her screaming about house and senate so much as i just think the tone is off in these scenes i always thought it would be the most difficult part to place on screen and for me so far at least it just comes across as dany soon to be warrior princess i know the story deepens and as mentioned is one of my favourite parts of the books but i rather wish theyd found a way of counteracting the slightly cheesy nature of the early part of her story its an unfair reaction but in all honesty i generally want to laugh when we head across the narrow sea "
"24" "Werthead" 2011-04-27 " interesting to see the ratings performance of the series is holding up quite well in the usa episode 2 got the same overnight ratings as episode 1 22 million which is pretty good for hbo adjusted for dvr repeats and people watching on the hbo website the figure for episode 1 was 68 million not far off the channels alltime premiere record boardwalk empires 71 million the adjusted ratings for episode 2 will likely be down since hbo nuked their schedule with repeats for episode 1 but nevertheless a solid performance on sky things were more mixed episode 1 got 740000 viewers on the night which is very impressive and 107 million adjusted which is startling by skys usual standards let alone a new channel they started up only a couple of months back episode 2 was down to 530000 on the night the adjusted ratings will be more telling for that though a combination of great weather and people going out on sundays no work on monday may not have helped but based on boardwalk empires performance i wouldnt be surprised to see it slip down to something around 200300000 and stabilise if it can keep well above that bracket that would be good going "
"25" "wheek" 2011-04-26 " hi thefatcaptain yes i watch a lot of good tv cheers wheek x "
"26" "byronw" 2011-04-26 " i intentionally did not reread any of the books before watching this and im pretty satisfied so far i understand that all of the subplots need to run concurrently instead of in large selfcontained chunks and some information that you have to wait longer for and sometimes only hear in the thoughts of the protagonists has to be stated explicitly that said i think theyre handling it well the effect of flashing between the plotlines does give the impression of things moving a little more quickly than in the books the only conceptualization that im a little disappointed in is the dothraki in the books they are portrayed as a race of people obviously patterned after the mongols but in the series they appear to be multiracial more like a mad maxstyle band of raiders than a distinct culture im not saying they necessarily needed to look asian but they should have something of a uniform look as far as daenerys storyas others have pointed out her charater in the early part of her story is somewhat bland and timid she doesnt start to blossom until she comes to terms with the dothraki way of life and the conflict with her brother escalates "
"27" "Sunburst" 2011-04-26 " dmckenzie the weakest element of the episode of course was all the daenerys stuff george r r martin is an inventive and refined creator of interesting characters but i cant help but always feel like dany is his one and only utter failure i strongly disagree i really enjoyed all the daenerys chapters in all the books in fact they were my favourite parts along with all the tyrion chapters especially in book one where her transformation from a quiet frightened girl into a confident young woman was in my opinion wonderfully portrayed as for the hbo daenerys i think emilia clarke is doing a great job and its really ridiculous to pronounce any kind of judgement on that whole storyline based on the first two episodes out of ten that have merely introduced the characters and the basic outlines of the story or rather the basic outlines of what the story might be we really havent seen anything important of the daenerys storyline yet patience is a virtue kezia 10 i agree with the age thing sansa just looks too old to be as believable as the naive blindedbyinfatuation young girl but why she is 13 in the series as she has said to cersei in the first episode and she looks 13 to me and she behaves like a typical silly 13yearold girl and there are plenty of people in their mid20s that i know who behave more or less like her as in their boyfriendgirlfriend is the only thing that exists in the world so whats so unbelievable here ishouldbewriting as for danys storyit could be seen as the weakestmost irrelevant for now partor it could be seen that she is learning well finally someone who isnt chronically impatient and i agree i mean how would the rest of you have handled danys scenes so far have her scream at drogo the womans place is in the house and the senate  its a medieval world the dothraki are a parallel for the huns or the mongols who werent exactly known for their liberal and postmodern treatment of women this was the most realistic way to depict their relationship so far and those lesbian scenes were rather understated its hbo people it could have been a lot raunchier and really after ten years of hbo bringing us shows like the sopranos sex and the city six feet under the wire how can anyone still be surprised by the sex and violence "
"28" "DrSmurfsGhost" 2011-04-26 " oh god so many spelling mistakes just read through my commentsorry it should be that coupled with the story of how the second moon split open from the heat of the sun and poured out a thousand dragons initiated the small suspicion that the dragon eggs may hatch after all "
"29" "MaxCairnduff" 2011-04-26 " ive no idea what happens with the dragon eggs in the books but given the zombiesice walkers of the north are back after thousands of years what used to be true clearly isnt true any more if magic is returning to the world it follows that eggs that appeared fossilised could be merely dormant on scales humans have so far not grasped or you know they could be nice paperweights i doubt well find out before series finale or season two at the earliest "
"30" "DrSmurfsGhost" 2011-04-26 " theyre actually fossilised dragon eggs i know they said this but surely the humans of the seven kingdoms have been wrong before twas merely a hope rather then an honest speculation but during the scene where the danaerys womangirl is having intimate relations with the barbarian leader she focusses on the dragon eggs with the candles around them and begins to smile creepilythat coupled with the story of how the second moon split open from the heat of the son and poored out a thousand dragons initiated the small suspiscion that the dragon eggs may hatch after all "
"31" "EddieLarkin" 2011-04-26 " main question on my mind at the moment though will the dragons hatch please say they do twould be very cool not to mention that baby dragons are the cutest theyre actually fossilised dragon eggs thousands of years old even if they are fertilised the embryos inside are stone so they wont be hatching in the books there more of a totem for dany which she draws her power from "

"39" "londonstillrocks" 2011-04-26 " definitely enjoying the series so far its interesting to watch having read the books multiple times tyrion being played excellently by dinklage and they pulled together some important scenes really well my criticisms and some of this more based on an affection for the books so may contain a couple of minor spoilers if people still intend to read them kind of confused by the switch they made with catelyn arguing against kings landing and ned saying it was necessary opposite of the books where ned doesnt want to go and catelyn being realistic about the fact friends or not itd be really dangerous for him to refuse roberts offer id have kept the it should have been you comment but i suppose i understand why it was taken out theres no opportunity for the this is what catelyn is thinking exposition that martin has available in the books cersei visiting catelyn was a weird scene very different from the books and very much a shift in cerseis character because of it "
"40" "DrSmurfsGhost" 2011-04-26 " ive yet to read the books will probably do so once this season is complete and am enjoying this quite a bit so farthe nudity count is slightly disturbing with the large amount of needless flashing done in the first episode but it is mildly interesting to ponder how the danaerys woman will become the one in charge in ways other then sexso far im loving edthe bean the most but that might just be due to him being the bean the dwarf prince is an interesting character and well played in my opinion not to mention the little girl arya being quite the interesting character as wellmain question on my mind at the moment though will the dragons hatch please say they do twould be very cool not to mention that baby dragons are the cutest "
"41" "JamesWMoar" 2011-04-26 " smartymcflyi dont mean in thematic terms  its certainly got that as pretty much any wellwritten story probably should only that it isnt actually our world in the pasta colony world in the futurereachable via a rainbow bridge etc its a story setting which exists independently of the real world "
"42" "SarahHughes" 2011-04-26 " thefatcaptain true but the problem was that actually i think she looked distractingly modern does that make sense shes the only actress ive seen so far that all i could think of was oh wait i know she was in something was it corrie or hollyoaks because she just seemed out of place somehow im not sure what it was something about her looks i think  i want to say her eyebrows but that possibly just makes me sound insane "
"43" "TheFatCaptain" 2011-04-26 " the hollyoaks actress teaching the blondedark eyebrows with evil brother sorry i forget her name how to go on top was some of the cheesiestbad actingembarrassing tv ive seen in a while really it wasnt great but some of the most embarassing tv youve seen recently you must watch a lot of very good television i do think people go over the top in their criticism on these blogs feel a bit sorry for roxanne mckee too got herself a small but potentially interesting part in a big tv show and she has to contend with hollyoaks being constantly added to her name in a sneering way including by the blog author here give her a chance anyway  very much enjoyed this episode joffrey is a brilliant villain i wonder ifwhen he will learn the error of his waysget his comeuppance "
"44" "SarahHughes" 2011-04-26 " sharpeiboy  so did i once upon a time its terrifyingly addictive redwinter i actually like nikolaj costerwaldaus performance i thought the scene with jon was actually quite subtle there was a hint that there was more to jaimes dislike of vows than seemed on the surface and a suggestion that he isnt as straightforwardly caddish as might appear then again linus76 ive never seen shrek yes i know terrible and i have small children as well hellcat no it isnt i thought it was a good scene and a good example of the freedom that benioff and weiss have when writing the lannister twins and how this is playing in their favour charliebronze  i think the thing with catelyn and jon is that its so out of character for eddard who as weve seen has a very strong moral code to have not only produced a bastard but then to never tell her more about said bastard other than hes of my blood accept him it happened very early on in their marriage  ie you rode off with robert and came back with a bastard baby and i think shes always struggled to reconcile the difference between ned as upright hero and ned as man who started their marriage with a child that was not hers actually one of the key lines in episode two was in the scene between eddard and jon its interesting that he doesnt say you are my son but rather you are of my blood which suggests there might be a bit more to the story then robert or catelyn realise "
"45" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-04-26 " jameswmoar at face value thus far there is very little perhaps to anchor any of the narrative to our own world however i think certain strands do become eireily more relevant to our own later on i dont think they were written that way well  esp since this was published in 96 but they do seem to hold a small mirror up to our own world events of last 15 years or so "

"49" "Kezia10" 2011-04-26 " krm123 i agree with the age thing sansa just looks too old to be as believable as the naive blindedbyinfatuation young girl she is in the book i see why they had to age the children but i wonder whether they could have had sansa at least played by someone who looked more her true age well have to see whether the rest of her storyline no spoilers i promise plays out better drquinzel i knew i recognised viserys couldnt work out where i had seen him before he was brilliant in dr who seems hes just very good at these horrifically unpleasant characters like most people i was a bit unsure about danys scenes in this episode i think i know why her relationship has been rewritten slightly but i think to people who havent read the books she isnt as nuanced and interesting a character  obviously on tv we dont know what is going on in her head which is where we learn most about her in the book again i suppose we have to hope that this changes quite quickly on a side note  i flicked onto sharpe reruns after this episode weird to see sean bean lose a few decadeshe still excels at these sort of roles though "

"51" "illocon" 2011-04-26 " joffrey is smackable with either a naturally odd face or some bizarre makeup to make him seem waxy and less lifelike and i think peter drinklage is perhaps over enunciating to emphasise the character to show that he takes care over his words because he has his brain wonderful character though and next to arya is my favourite character "

"56" "DrQuinzel" 2011-04-26 " i havent read the books but im enjoying the series so far i should probably be outraged by the treatment of the women in it but theyre strong enough actresses and interesting enough characters for the show to get away with outrageous sexism as with mad men you suspect that many of these female characters will wind up on top hehe in the end joffrey and especially viserys are two of the best hissable villains ive seen on screen in ages harry lloyd viserys also played a brilliant villain in doctor whos human nature twoparter so i was pleased to see him cast in this peter dinklage is clearly having great fun in a role that is more rounded and risque that roles usually available to dwarfs ive lost track of what the politically correct term is these days sorry but its great to see him cutting loose in a scenestealing role and slapping his little shit of a nephew finally the girl playing ayra is brilliant and watching sean bean and mark addy play opposite each other is just great fun "
"57" "DMcKenzie" 2011-04-26 " better than the first in my view the pilot had to set up so many different strands and storylines that aside from a few nifty twists and revelations it suffered from not having ant scenes with breathing space which made it tricky to create any real drama this one also moved around a little too much for my liking obviously i realise thats kinda the way it has to be at this stage in the game but there were a few nice moments and scenes that i thought made it an improvement on the debut tyrion and jons scene was handled well with dinklage continuing to steal the show robert and neds conversation was well acted thought sprinkled with alot of exposition the assassination attempt on bran was very well done those wolves are really coming into their own and speaking of wolves the best storyline by far this episode was that of joffrey arya and the wolf thier confrontation on the rivershore was good enough with all the kids putting in quality performances especially arya who along with tyrion is probably my favoutite performance so far but the following ruling between ned cersie and robert was simply fantastic tv more than anything weve seen in this series so far it really gave us a sense of these characters joffrey utterly foul and pathetic robert sympathitic but ultimately weak sansa idealistic and yet unloyal to her family when she should be they were all great the final ruling that sansas wolf should be killed and neds hard decision to kill it himself was probably the most dramatic and moving scene weve had in the show so far powerful stuff the weakest element of the epsiode of course was all the daenary stuff george r r martin is an inventive and refined creator of interesting characters but i cant help but always feel like dany is his one and only utter failure 2dimensional with no real believable motivations for her actions she is the ultimate fantasy of a dd nerd and not much more trust me the cheesy lesbian moments in this episode are by no means the last or the most graphic involving her alot of people here are saying her storyline gets better it doesnt it gets more dramatic certainly but in terms of developing a believable sympathisably character it only gets worse out from here but yes overall still not quite brilliant and still suffering a little from the demands of being adapted to television but mostly very good stuff that hopefully will only get better as the weeks progress "
"58" "avidfan" 2011-04-26 " ron perlman should have been the hound "
"59" "smilerone" 2011-04-26 " hmm i mean a glossary for the main characters however come to think of it a chronology of events may help as well "
"60" "smilerone" 2011-04-26 " ok i thought the second episode was better than the first agree with comments about events across the sea that better improve soon pleased to see that there is more than one sexual position in the game of thrones seriously though i know times were brutal and grim but the treatment of women left me feeling somewhat uncomfortable in the first episode havent read any of the books so all i have to go on is these two episodes im beginning to think i need a chronology for all the names i keep on asking my partner so is who is she related to the theme music and opening credits are excellent "
"61" "krm123" 2011-04-26 " great second episode i thought  one comment i would make about sansa is that to me she is the stark child that has suffered the most from the fact that the producers had to age up all the kids a few years from the book in the book as a younger teenager it is perfect for her to be infaturated with the idea of her as the perfect princess and to be in love with joffrey her perfect prince and to ignore anything that seems to threaten that image in the show as an older teenager the same lines just seem to fall flat or at worst make her come across as a bit dimwitted i think this should resolve itself as things go along though "
"62" "linus76" 2011-04-26 " yes redwinter i agree with you on nikolaj costerwaldau i want to enjoy his performance but that haircut makes him prince charming from shrek seriously who thought that was a good look im hoping we get a bit more than witty put downs from him soon great casting on joffery i laughed at joffrey pulls off the rare trick of being imminently punchable before he has even uttered a word he reminds me a bit of mordred from excalibur enjoying it all so far not read the books i thought catelyns leave comment to jon was pretty nasty it didnt need to be any more we got just how much she loathes him from the moments preceding that line "
"63" "FormicaAtomica" 2011-04-26 " ugh just went back to read the jon and catelyn scene again cow cow cow "
"64" "FormicaAtomica" 2011-04-26 " oh joffrey loved him getting slapped as snivelling as in the books not one redeeming character trait at all obviously some differences in the book i think it may have been robb who walked in cant remember but the point where catelyn tells jon to go away was pretty much where she lost my vote in the books as well cow always thought dany came into her own after well i wont spoil it but her story does get interesting littlefinger and varys next i miss leering a bit at hollyoaks girl pretty sure that wasnt in the first book but im not complaining hbohbo "
"65" "redwinter" 2011-04-26 " many of the subtleties discussed here escape me as ive never read the books so my views are solely based on what ive seen on screen i agree that the relationship between ned and robert is great and im delighted to see mark addy and sean bean with really meaty roles the contrast between their ease when they are alone and the conflict brought about by joffreys lies was beautifully drawn robert wants a simple life  but the combination of duty and duplicity leaves him no choice but to break a childs heart as for joffrey how marvellous to have such a hissable villain whos only a kid petulant vain and cowardly no wonder arya hates him im actually quite intrigued by the daeneryskhal drogo relationship it may turn out that daenerys is as bland and wooden as some have mentioned but im quite taken with the stillness and otherworldliness of her performance especially the scenes with her monstrous brother i really hope he comes to a very sticky end i have no idea where the uprising storyline will go but i am on board there is a prospect of daenerys and drogo forming a formidable partnership if she plays her cards right the only bum note for me so far i hate to say has been nikolaj costerwaldau usually so wonderful but here it felt like hed read duplicitous cad 101 and was going through the motions finally i dont feel at a loss not having read the books but i am very thankful for hbos microsite especially for keeping track of the family relationships and histories  because there is a lot of info packed in so far "
"66" "wtgab" 2011-04-26 " i think that the need to condense the source material has led to a lack of red herrings and distractions the need to show vital plot points for this and later seasons means that everything that is said or done on screen is in some way relevant to later plot developments that means that too much is being given away to the astute viewer who hasnt read the books too early "
"67" "SimonEssex" 2011-04-26 " enjoyed it immensely thought danibois reason why they left out catelyns line to jon it should have been you was brilliant  i was miffed at first that theyd softpeddled it but after a bit of thought i agree with him so far then  dodgy accent aside  im loving peter dinklage as tyrion in fact all the lannisters and starks are top notch so far even sansa is fine for me looking forward to those wolves getting bigger and bigger great throatripping action in brans bedroom danys story isnt interesting yet but it will be i think despite the cheese in the build up to it the sex scene between her and drogo where she asserts herself more is well handled  as if a tippingpoint has been reached her story and emilia clarkes performance will be easier to judge once she has had more to work with than just scenes of her in various states of submission or fright my one problem from episode two is with sandor the hound something is missing for me from the onscreen character weve seen so far compared to the one we have in the book his return with the butchers boy micah was a case in point  there was no evidence from the actor of the black humour he finds and displays in slaying the boy for joffrey  or of his cynical poisonous attitude and disdain for everyone its the one big misstep so far for me "
"68" "sharpeiboy" 2011-04-26 " sunburst i wouldnt have called cersei twodimensional from my mentalknowledge of her but i reckon the producer thought that a viewer couldnt really hate a character intensely unless they firstofall had a sort of affection for her a bit like the clegg effect i suppose writ large first seeing lena headey made me think of mrs overall  really impressed by what ive seen so far hadnt even heard of her in the past but this role will really make her name if she gets it right bit like whatshername in harry potter one of the addictive things is that the reader sorry can gloss over boring chapter or scenes  only on the 5th or 6th rereading or so  crack is good biblical scholarship is maybe better if only because it is legal you realise that it is as carefully written  as relevant as what surrounds it "
"69" "CharlieBronze" 2011-04-26 " firmly in the pervert camp  what did we get maybe a flash of one boob boo sucks to be a butchers boy and sucks to be a bastard i cant understand the hostility catelyn still has towards jon hes been living with them for 17 years so why after all this time is she still nursing a grudge especially as the rest of the siblings demonstrate love for him the assassination attempt was the best scene followed by anything with tyrionthe ned and rob big tits chat was a bit naff but the judgement scene at the end gave the actors something more to chew on joffreys scream of cunt at arya was startling although i felt having this one character be wholly irredeemable lacked nuance when compared to the other lannisters his bodyguard hound is more interesting "
"70" "ErmintrudeSnotte" 2011-04-26 " i find myself distracted by dodgy syrups there has to to be a reason for the blond wigs being so bad with eyebrows apparently lightened with white greasepaint no spoilers though please "
"71" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-04-26 " sharpeiboy  i agree probably one of the key 10 lines of the first book it sums up so much both about cat and jon i dont understand why it was left out the only reason is that they are trying to soften cat ive had time to dwell on the episode  and i think it feels weaker the more i dwell my oh wasnt overly impressed by the whole a few key scenes yes but she isnt engaged with it yet "
"72" "EddieLarkin" 2011-04-26 " i admit that the dany stuff is definitely the least interesting part at this point but it was in the book at this stage perils of sticking so close to the source material too bad they didnt have more screen time to invent some new dany stuff "
"73" "sharpeiboy" 2011-04-25 " daniboi that must get horrendously tedious for readers who only want to talk about what theyve seen on tellythis is  i think going to be one of the main problems for the whole series series of series for the viewers as well as for the whole production team there is something to be said for the cliche lousy books make great films  vice versa it will not do in this case sarah hughes because readers of this blog are a bunch of pervertsconcerned about the high levels of gratuitous nudity in this show alas such cynicism is one so young im just wondering which camp i fall into re danaerys i remember not feeling much about the whole scenario across the sea until later on in the book especially not the central fact of it being central to the main action the whole otherness of that place is a sort of foil to the events on the mainland  even the maps in the books do not really put the landmasses together  a real expert would not know how long or in which direction youd need to sail to get to pentos gawd havent even seen it yet  im pontificating  hope no spoilers  a quick word will shut me up it should have been you  that should have been left in it really shocked me when i first read it  was a good hint as to why c is not the perfect helpmate that she is portrayed thus far "
"74" "SarahHughes" 2011-04-25 " werthead ah i missed that admittedly hes not a vital character right now i almost quite liked the idea that hed never be seen daniboi i think youre absolutely spot on as to why they did it and i debated mentioning it due to the whole this is a blog about the tv series i did in the end because i think it was an unnecessary softening of the character its still possible to understand catelyns reactions even if you dont support them and dropping the line rather smacked of setting the odds in favour of one character or set of characters ie the starks and i wasnt sure it was needed smartymcfly  ive heard that that episode two is the worst of the ten so heres hoping that the narrow sea stuff improves but i failed entirely to keep a straight face during the whole now this is how to screw your man speech smallpaul i hope so because im really struggling here although along with wheek i sort of love how bad the acting in that scene was sunburst  i completely agree about cersei i think both the lannister twins are benefitting from the freedom that benioff and weiss have regarding their lines because we dont get to see them in depth as characters in the first book the writers have a bit more freedom here and i think it plays in their favour "
"75" "Sunburst" 2011-04-25 " i loved it im getting the exact same feeling like when i discovered these books back in 2004 ive almost forgotten that feeling its been seven years after all but now that the tv series is here i am again totally enchanted by the vast sprawling story and the deliciously complex characters and its only the second episode the best and the most amazing stuff is yet to come and there are some aspects that the series in my opinion is doing better than the books did cersei for example she was definitely the flattest character in the books almost a typical evil queen slutty and heartless and almost nothing else and the few attempts martin made every now and then to make her more interesting always seemed somehow artificial and useless so i am very pleasantly surprised that the cersei in the series is a very different character as evidenced by the scene when she talks to catelyn over brans bed there is much more depth to her now and its amazing to me how one of the least interesting characters in the books suddenly becomes one of the most interesting lena headey is also doing an amazing job to reinforce that i used to hate cersei simply because she was a dull and twodimensional character but now i freaking love her i actually believe she felt remorse over brans fall as for the daenerys storyline for heavens sake nothing of importance has happened there yet be patient shame that there was very little of viserys this episode though harry lloyd just blew me away last week that guy can act all in all im thrilled this story is like crack whether in book or tv form i think ill rewatch the first two episodes at least three times until next monday not that i know what crack is like i dont i guess its rather addictive too "
"76" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-04-25 " i agree with everything said so far the danaerys scenes arent translating well to tv at the moment  im hopeful that it will change as the plot evolves some of the scenes are just uncomfortable not just is the intended way im afraid to say that some of tonights episode was verging on the cheesiness and not just danearys scenes some of the dialogue feels unnatural and forced  and i hate to say it but it in part around the younger actors its not their fault it is mainly in the dialogue itself having said that some of the scenes worked really well overall i felt tonights was much weaker than last weeks episode although if the previews are to be believed episode 2 was by far the weakest of the first 6 "
"77" "Daniboi" 2011-04-25 " i have a lot of sympathy for the people who only watch the tv series havent read the books and perhaps dont have any intention of ever reading the books so wont go into how certain scenes are betterworse than how id imagined them in my head that must get horrendously tedious for readers who only want to talk about what theyve seen on telly that said i reckon the reason they took out the it should have been you that got pushed out of the window to his possible death line from catelyn to jon was that it would have taken the viewers away from her too much i watched the scene with mrs daniboi who hasnt read the books and even cat saying i want you to leave now had her mrs daniboi saying what a cow if shed said the line as written mrs d would probably have finished the ep with more sympathy for cersei lannister than for catelyn stark which wouldve been strange "
"78" "wheek" 2011-04-25 " the hollyoaks actress teaching the blondedark eyebrows with evil brother sorry i forget her name how to go on top was some of the cheesiestbad actingembarrassing tv ive seen in a while i havent read the books but it does feel like the producers and writers are trying to pack too much into each episode and some of the acting bad and some of the writing is poor if i didnt love bad acting and poor writing i wouldnt watch it "
"79" "SmallPaul" 2011-04-25 " this episode was largely concerned with the difference between dreams and reality excellent pointthis is a great summation of why the series is so different from others in the genre as for the across the narrow sea storyline i think once dany starts asserting herself it will be more interesting as it was in the books "
"80" "Werthead" 2011-04-25 " i agree that the dothraki stuff really isnt transferring well to the screen theres too much hokeyness and khal drogo is such a blank slate of a character that theres nothing jason momoa nor jason momoas arse introduced tonight by popular demand can do at the moment interesting to see if tvwatchers pick up on it is known as a catchphrase as much as the bookreaders though most of the rest of it was pretty good the scene with the assassin was pretty brutal the ned and robert relationship was really wellportrayed in this episode and tyrion had all the best lines as per usual something that was a little odd is that in episode 1 catelyn had been softened a lot from the first book where she has much stronger skills of political acumen and foresight and was more understanding of neds decision to go south but in this episode tv cat suddenly seemed to turn into book cat and was perfectly willing to leave brans side to depart on a mission that might take months to resolve thats an abrupt aboutface not just from the last episode but from about ten minutes earlier in this one the as yet unmet rickon is the maris of this show he was in episode 1 quite briefly laughing at brans ineptness with the bow alongside robb and jon and then went around picking up everyones weapons afterwards and putting them away a nice squirelike role for him actually given his age and position thats the sort of thing hed be expected to do robert also patted him on the head when he arrived but thats about it so far "
