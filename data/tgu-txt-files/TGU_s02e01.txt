"1" "Lime83" 2012-04-06 " so im not the only one who noticed  fair point as well "
"2" "chutzzpah" 2012-04-05 " quite honestly im just about at the end of my lets be american friendly tether  this is a british newspaper hell would freeze over before the washington post ran a series blog to fit with any passing british viewers timetable  in the last 3 months ive got confused about an article just about every week until ive realised they are articles written by yanks for yanks  there was one on privatised healthcare that had my head in a spin until i finally clarified that it was about the american healthcare system  but it wasnt tagged under us artcles just healthcare by all means give us more reasons to go elsewhere guardian  but brits not signing in will hit your revenue much more than the samll groups of americans that come here regularly "
"3" "badger1969" 2012-04-05 " it wasnt only roberts kids either the point of the boring book that ned had in s1  the one that jon arryn had been reading not long before he died  was that it described all baratheon children over the generations as darkhaired and jon arryns last words  or near last words  were reported as the seed is strong "
"4" "SterlingArcher" 2012-04-05 " wasnt sure about the bastard killing at the end were they just rounding up every dark haired boy or does someone know exactly who roberts kids are "
"5" "JamesWMoar" 2012-04-05 " yep in theory joffrey could be roberts but every single other child that he had and as the scene in the programme showed all too well there were a lot of illegitimate children was dark haired  pretty low odds of it only being his legitimate kids who came out blonde think the book might have also included references to other children of baratheons and lannisters who turned out darkhaired as well "
"6" "SterlingArcher" 2012-04-05 " liam cunningham looks exactly how i imagined stannis which makes those scenes a little odd for me not seen enough of stannis to get a good impression yet but otherwise the whole thing was a great return cant wait for the next episode "
"7" "smilerone" 2012-04-04 " been waiting for the return and enjoyed the first episode my only experience of got has been on tv and the first series was compulsive viewing at our house my only fear is that since im not a great fan of the fantasy genre the second series will become overloaded with witches and dragons and contain clunker of lines such as red comet in the sky means dragons fly however will be glued to my set next sunday "
"8" "ChinofJim" 2012-04-04 " it was a nice touch that in his first scene on the beach stannis was literally grinding he teeth although it looked like he was sucking on a wasp that isnt a spoiler in any sense just a nice thing for book readers "
"9" "ChinofJim" 2012-04-04 " it was a nice touch that in his first scene on the beach stannis was literally grinding he teeth although it looked like he was sucking on a wasp that isnt a spoiler in any sense just a nice thing for book readers "
"10" "Musa1" 2012-04-04 " how much of this story about a mythical fantasy world westeros is actually commentary on contemporary real world western civilization why is monogamy and fidelity in marriage significantwhy is paternal lineage important why has incest been such a reoccurring and potentially volatile issue the guy living in the woods with his daughterwives and treated like he cant be killed with a quick chop what do dragons represent merely animals that do the bidding of sociopathic elites or undeniable supernatural retribution but isnt the targaneyan family demonic and bloodthirsty in their own rite "
"11" "kneerash" 2012-04-04 "  cavalierdisregard i agree just some little details you pick up on im ashamed to admit that as a fan of the fantasy genre i had never read a song of ice and fire after watching season 1 i couldnt wait they were going beyond the wall so ive since read them and am nearly done with book 5 after reading the first book and then re watching season 1 before season 2 started i found i enjoyed it even more i loved being able to look at some minor character in the tv show and think yeah i know who this guy is and what his story is etc allot of commnts on this blog point to the quick scene when cressanspelling died after drinking the wine with milesandra although it was a good scene it didnt really set up who cressan rwas what he meant to stannis etc the long intro to the second book gives this background and when i saw the death on screen it held much more meaning for me i was watching with my girlfirend who has not read the books and she was confused as to who all these new people were and why milesandra wanted cressan dead i then proceeded into a long winded description of who they all were which im pretty sure i enjoyed more then she did "
"12" "Kezia10" 2012-04-04 "  violentdelightsi know their dead son had black hair but its not beyond the realms of possiblity and indeed robert obviously believed they were his for the blonde to have won out in the subsequent children im thinking too much about this no you can never think too much about all of this  by the way that will only get worse if you read the books yep in theory joffrey could be roberts but every single other child that he had and as the scene in the programme showed all too well there were a lot of illegitimate children was dark haired  pretty low odds of it only being his legitimate kids who came out blonde i find it hard to imagine what it would be like watching the tv series without having read the books but i think it is much easier to know the characters when you have already read about them  you certainly dont have the problem of thinking now who else mentioned that and so on my husband watched half of series 1 without having read them but has since read the whole series so hes now in the same boat as me at least i dont have to hide my reactions to significantforthefuture moments this time round  hiding things like neds beheading last time became tedious "
"13" "CavalierDisregard" 2012-04-04 " ive not read the books it didnt seem like the tv series explained it fully there is definately an element of having to think with the show that is made far easier by having read the books i hadnt read any of them when i saw the first series but am up to book four now and there are certain things that you pick up that i missed before often its just the secondary characters that are only briefly seen in the show who you dont really know who they are for example in this episode when joffrey told one of his kingsguard to give ser dontos the wine he called him by his name i wouldnt have taken that in before but since reading the books i know that was ser meryn trant "
"14" "TheNorthRemembers" 2012-04-04 " it was the scene with him and cersei i noticed it i remember his face from the wire firstly i hope he is not ill secondly i hope he hasnt had anything done i thought aidan gillen playing littlefinger looked familiar but could not place him  thanks as now i realise he was councilman thomas tommy carcetti in the wire  "
"15" "ViolentDelights" 2012-04-04 " just noticed youd replied to me too thanks for the explanation ive not read the books it didnt seem like the tv series explained it fully "
"16" "ViolentDelights" 2012-04-04 " aaah ive not read the books so dont know if the reasoning behind it is explained more clearly in them although we know that the baratheon black hair is a dominant trait and the lannister blonde seems to be too  so whos to say which should win i know their dead son had black hair but its not beyond the realms of possiblity and indeed robert obviously believed they were his for the blonde to have won out in the subsequent children im thinking too much about this "
"17" "Kezia10" 2012-04-04 "  violentdelights and anyway none of them were legitimate so even if they did prove that joffrey isnt a baratheon the throne would have gone to stannis not one of the poor wee weans its not so much about who the throne goes to as noone being able to prove that joffrey isnt roberts son  ie kill all the blackhaired offspring and noone will be able to compare their appearance to joffreys i was so excited to watch this episodei thought it was pretty good overall though i agree with other posters that craster didnt look as id imagined him i wasnt entirely convinced by the red woman either but ill wait and see what the next few episodes bring there i was very happy that they didnt spend the first half of the episode reintroducing the characters with a last time on got style filler "
"18" "Pithyoneliner" 2012-04-04 " best thing on tv of course it is lots of respect being rightly accorded to peter dinklage and maisy williams for their performances for me the third outstanding actor of the series is jack gleeson imho he isnt getting the credit he deserves if you consider joffrey is supposed to be loathsome and the audience is supposed to hate him as well as being slightly afraid  jack seems to achieving that effect admirably cant really warm to bran but that was the case in the books too "
"19" "CavalierDisregard" 2012-04-04 " i noticed one of the first commenters referring to roberts bastard sons but i was pretty sure that the baby in the brothel was a daughter and anyway none of them were legitimate so even if they did prove that joffrey isnt a baratheon the throne would have gone to stannis not one of the poor wee weans i think they just meant bastardborn rather than sons specifically and the reason cersei wants all the bastardborn children of robert dead is that they all without exception have roberts dark hair whereas joffrey myrcella  tommen have the golden lannister hair if this became public knowledge it would strengthen stannis claim that none of them are roberts children which in turn strengthens his claim to the throne plus cerseis an evil bitch "
"20" "MJ1972" 2012-04-04 " ah but i didnt tell them all about it i merely said it was excellent and gave a few reasons why i made sure i didnt give away any details and im sure i didnt spoil anything for anyone but i get your point and sarahs  ill stick to discussing episode 1 for what its worth though i kind of agree with what huwlyanthomas said about not watching the leaked version of episode 2 i dont regret watching it in the slightest but as huw said the image quality leaves a bit to be desired and the lack of subtitles means youll miss out on some dialogue so yeah you do pay a price for your curiosity and on that note ill stop being a smug episode2 watcher and will enjoy the discussion on episode 1 "
"21" "MarkWE" 2012-04-04 " 3 april 2012 539pmresponse to lauralol 3 april 2012 239pm spolier alert  why ruin it for people didnt really see a spoiler in the post you refer to only some comment about the character in the show and the book and the comments about the character in the book should already be apparent in the show "
"22" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-04-04 " correction above  the broadcast versions are 720p not full hd but they look stunning in any case "
"23" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-04-04 " for anyone whos scratching their head  ive looked in one of the usual places and wouldnt want to watch the version currently on offer a web rip with no subtitles in any case the first viewing will always be the most impactful and you only get one chance at it speaking personally id rather wait the few days it takes to see it in full hd with no risk of dropped frames and subtitled as intended by the creators "
"24" "SarahHughes" 2012-04-04 " guys can we hold off discussing episode two already please theres been enough strong opinion expressed over the timing of this blog without further driving people insane by discussing the second episode a week before it airs thanks "
"25" "singist" 2012-04-04 " yes ive watched it too but aware that other people on here probably havent i contained the desire to tell them all about it "
"26" "Kyza06" 2012-04-04 " what an opener sansa managing to portray suffering pain  above all fear of her life with just her eyestyrion walking through 2 scenes and completely stealing themcersei giving and in the next scene gettting lessons in power along with the return of mad men monday nights for the next 1012 weeks will be glorious telly am currently debating whether to wait til sunday for e2 or watch it tonight and have to wait an extra week for e3 "
"27" "ViolentDelights" 2012-04-04 " i appreciate that im very late to the party here but i dont have sky and had to wait til i was able to go round to my boyfriends last night and abuse his sky subscription thank you anytime i also only watched season 1 recently so it was still fresh in my mind as others have commented i thought littlefingers accent was a bit different ditto danys but that might just have been me i noticed one of the first commenters referring to roberts bastard sons but i was pretty sure that the baby in the brothel was a daughter and anyway none of them were legitimate so even if they did prove that joffrey isnt a baratheon the throne would have gone to stannis not one of the poor wee weans "
"28" "singist" 2012-04-04 " yes totes noticed this i thought maybe it was the strange overdubbing in that scene but i sneakily watched episode 2 last night and there is no doubt that he is doing a slightly welsh accent this season for no explicable reason and yeah hes face looks a little bit like hes hanging upside down is that what botox does i need to get me some of that "
"29" "BenjyUK" 2012-04-04 " watching the tv series having read the books is strangely satisfying not like many adaptations where you always feel concerned about missing details or rushed explanations im just constantly surprised at how con tent i am with the pace and depth of the show "
"30" "Thisismyusername123" 2012-04-04 " yeah i thought that too but thought i might be going a bit mad his accent has changed weird "
"31" "monders" 2012-04-04 " great i cant wait to watch it on sunday no need for a blog next week sarah mj1972 has summed it up quite nicely "
"32" "MJ1972" 2012-04-04 " a big thank you to whoever pointed out that episode 2 is already on line if you know where to look for it i just watched it and its superb  better than episode 1 in my opinion it focuses on about half of the major characters without making any mention of the other characters as a result the stories feel more fleshed out and less rushed there are quite a few laughoutloud moments as well as a few fairly chilling ones littlefinger gets to deliver a monologue that gave me goosebumps and the one direwolf that appears in this episode looks quite good in daylight so no worries on that score "
"33" "gatecrass" 2012-04-04 " it was the scene with him and cersei i noticed it i remember his face from the wire firstly i hope he is not ill secondly i hope he hasnt had anything done it didnt kirk douglasor robert redford any favours and my heart still sinks at what jack lemmon looked liked after he had an eye lift or whatever its called "
"34" "CavalierDisregard" 2012-04-04 " was it just me or did the actor playing littlefinger look and sound a bit different like hed decided to change his accent or hed forgotten the one hed used in series 1 he also looked a little tight perhaps botox some work around his eyes or maybe even he is ill its not as bad as the character being played by a new actor but i found it off putting i thought that too although having not watched the first series since it was shown last year i thought it might have just been me "
"35" "AngloHybrid" 2012-04-04 " just a quick point re the number of adverts our sky box died yesterday which meant we lost all the saved items on there so in order to watch got i went to the sky app on xbox live and viewed it there one advert and the blackberry interstitial at the start and then the whole episode ran uninterrupted i know this will only be of usevalue to a limited number of people but if you can help just one person "
"36" "Kitten69" 2012-04-04 " theres some of us with no choice about it cable tv here in japan is crappy for a number of reasons first everything has to be either subtitled for tv or dubbed in japanese for dvd release  this takes time secondly japanese cable companies like their bottom line meaning theyll wait an entire season to screen something as by that time the syndication rights are much cheaper thirdly terrestrial japanese tv is on par with the us networks output in the 70s  all game shows and bland slapstick humour cable doesnt have to do much to improve on that and 90 of the cable package is either freetoview stuff like old mtv golf and tennis luckily we dont get fox news history and discovery are asiaoriented so i download and watch uk or us programming a day or so later "
"37" "molari" 2012-04-04 " urfe  most dvd players have a usb slot meaning should one want to they can watch got or any other show on their tv and without advertsannoying popup graphics etcwhich ruin immersion "
"38" "gatecrass" 2012-04-04 " was it just me or did the actor playing littlefinger look and sound a bit different like hed decided to change his accent or hed forgotten the one hed used in series 1 he also looked a little tight perhaps botox some work around his eyes or maybe even he is ill its not as bad as the character being played by a new actor but i found it off putting "
"39" "Urfe" 2012-04-04 " also why so many people moaning about the release date of this bolg etc download the thing as soon as it airs in the us i dont think ive watched a single tv show i liked on the tv at the time it airs in years download it all best way to do it call me old fashioned but i quite like sitting in front of the telly with the excitement building knowing something you really want to watch is coming on soon not everyone wants to download something from somewhere and watch it on a laptop maybe thats why so many people are moaning "
"40" "SmartyMcFly" 2012-04-04 " i dont think he was actually that bad in outcasts  the script however was a complete dog i always saw davos as more slight and wiry whilst i think cunningham will be great in got his appearance doesnt match my imagined version "
"41" "Offred" 2012-04-04 " i know what you mean i read the books as a teenager and stopped because there was a loooong wait for the next one to come out book 5 maybe so i just left it and never started reading them again and forgot a lot of it now youve got people who have just recently read them you watch the show with them and they take this smug knowitall attitude to explaining the genealogies to you and you just think yeahi was there 10 years before you mate "
"42" "Kirjava13" 2012-04-04 " i must confess i wasnt and am still not overly confident in liam cunninghams abilities wrt davos but then this might be something to do with his atrocious performance in outcasts it should be noted that he was far from alone in being terrible there "
"43" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-04-04 " id love the tv adaptation to take on a life of its own by leaving the books behind and getting on with the plot of  the dragons the dragon queen the creatures from beyond the wall not to mention tyrion joffrey plus sansa and the other stark children i think that the tv adaptation is more lovingly crafted than the books the adaptation arguably benefits from the discipline of having to get the story over within a limited fixed timeframe something that plainly does not bother grrm who is notorious for describing every morsel of food at a banquet etc arguably such things are superfluous details which pad the pages and slow the pace but they also surely provide a lot of the texture that has been mined for the tv shows visuals personally while i very much enjoy the tv series i would actually appreciate a slower pacing sometimes if only to spend more time with particular characters and more generally in the fictional world being presented the endings always come far too soon "
"44" "badger1969" 2012-04-04 " yes they are though since all my bookcases are full so new books end up in piles currently this hasnt bothered me so much  "
"45" "MoneyMustGo" 2012-04-04 " ive read the books but gave up with them eventually  they get really boringwhereas the tv adaptation is wonderful fast moving and the characters come to life in a way that is missing on the written page its quite simply brilliant entertainment id love the tv adaptation to take on a life of its own by leaving the books behind and getting on with the plot of  the dragons the dragon queen the creatures from beyond the wall not to mention tyrion joffrey plus sansa and the other stark children i think that the tv adaptation is more lovingly crafted than the books "
"46" "BenjyUK" 2012-04-03 " stannis isnt at all how i pictured him thought hed be somewhat rougher more of a mark strong type character who clearly i was desperate to be cast as stannis he played the part well though and the letter scene was brilliant also still disappointed with shae she doesnt seem as insightful as i expected from the books more of a shallow character intended simply for tyrion to expand his character which i guess given the time constraints is fair brilliant introduction though really excited for more of danys romping around the middle east hope the dragons get as good a treatment via cgi as grey wind did oh yeah episode 2 was good "
"47" "trickydicky" 2012-04-03 " i was just about to say that "
"48" "Malkatrinho" 2012-04-03 " try asking the kat "
"49" "quirkypenguin" 2012-04-03 " i know seeing gary was amazing "
"50" "Simgeo" 2012-04-03 " i think davos should have been made entirely out of onions surely they can do that with cgi "
"51" "5432Hun" 2012-04-03 " mark strong would have been good  but id still go for eccleston given the choice "
"52" "5432Hun" 2012-04-03 " episode 2 the night lands is now available to watch if you know where to look for it cough cough why is it that everyone always seems to know where to bloody look except me "
"53" "monders" 2012-04-03 " that happened with my gunslinger collection and just having a quick look now my copy of ffc is bigger than my other asoiaf books "
"54" "wilsbowski" 2012-04-03 " just a quick question with regard to waiting for the paperback are your copies of dance with dragons a larger size than the rest of the collection i only ask as i bought all the books from amazon shortly after the last seasons finale and they lined up nicely on my bookshelf so despite finishing feast for crows back in november i decided to wait until the paperback version of dwd came out so i had a matching set so to speak unfortunately the 2 dwd paperbacks i received were about an inch taller and wider which has deeply upset m being as anally retentive as i am "
"55" "monders" 2012-04-03 " its king in the north "
"56" "monders" 2012-04-03 " finally caught up  great start i was also delighted to see ben crompton – aka colin in ideal – make perfect use of a certain type of mancunian dourness in the role of edd tollett agreed he nailed it and i always had ed as a fellow manc when reading the books the huge dire wolf looked great as did the cgi dragon new cast all spot on imho davos especially ill have to read cok again because now he looked wrong in my head more when ive read the blog and digested the ep "
"57" "Malkatrinho" 2012-04-03 " episode 2 the night lands is now available to watch if you know where to look for it cough cough "
"58" "BlueCalx" 2012-04-03 " yeah  i thought it was a nice cut to gendry not just for the jeopardy but also to set up gendry as an unresolved threat to joffreys reign "
"59" "SimonEllicott" 2012-04-03 " hi sara tv got the best ever on the box outstanding opening episode blog great review as always comments section will have to be ignored in the future as many posters lack self restraint  are discussing the books rather than the tv version unless you or the mods rule as kingqueen the anarchy will spoil what was an enjoyable shared experience "
"60" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-04-03 " littlefinger basically stood in front of her and said incest incest incest for no apparent reason at all then looked surprised when she got testy yes it seemed strange that he would poke her like that out of character for someone whos supposedly subtle on the other hand her counterexample of what power is was essentially the same gambit that joff used to kill ned ie it works really well right up to the point where it blows up in the wielders face  i enjoyed that aspect of the scene "
"61" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-04-03 " ros said the exact same words littlefinger said to her when she first arrived in kings landing verbatim that was weird i thought it was a nice touch  she has studied under the master  "
"62" "ManofConstantSorrow" 2012-04-03 " i really thought they were going to show the baby being killed a great scene to demonstrate how brutal westeros really is about as brutal as 1st century palestine i think youll find "
"63" "ManofConstantSorrow" 2012-04-03 " ive had no problem keeping tabs on whats going on and ive not read the books the first one is loaded on the kindle for holiday at the end of the month i think hbo led the way but others are following  crediting the audience with a bit of grey matter actually works the producers of fringe for example have cut no slack for those that cant keep up and so far it seems to be working were about to lend the series 1 box set to my fatherinlaw and he and the motherinlaw will be a good test for the theory as they are not sophisticated tv viewers "
"64" "badger1969" 2012-04-03 " i must admit i rarely get as obsessed over a tv seriesset of books having only just finished the last book waited for the paperback just because i already had all the others in that format   only finished the fourth a few weeks back anyway i know i could very easily go back  read them again  pick up the significance of even more stuff i missed the first time even with the first book  for example  i convinced myself towards the end that i knew who jon snows mother was but i still want to go back  check that there isnt some key piece of information i missed earlier in the book that means im barking up the wrong tree i also love the stuff that can be added to the tv series  predominantly between non pov characters  that has added significance  or at least i can perceive it as such  because of future events in the books as a vague as possible example  arya seeshears something in the first series which from her pov in the book is really well vague on screen you get to see what she sees  as far as i was concerned it was a piece of information that didnt show up in the books until the last one "
"65" "wilsbowski" 2012-04-03 " just another note on spoilers some people might perfectly innocently say something like yeah that character has quite a journey ahead of them in the next few seasons which in a series that ive seen touted as where anyone can die is actually a pretty big spoiler sorry im aware that by pointing this out i am actually drawing more attention to something which may have gone unnoticed otherwise "
"66" "badger1969" 2012-04-03 " and it gets even more difficult as the books go on i fear they might be forced to cut huge swathes of characters out entirely i wonder if the odd separate miniseries might be in order i already foresee some kind of prequel spartacus style to tell the story of what happened with the targaryens  roberts rebellion  presumably once grrm is willing to reveal everything from the past but dorne  for example  seems both significant to the overall story but also largely very separate i know we are avoiding spoilers  difficult as that can be  but i hope the fact that there is a place called dorne  some characters from there are introduced at some point in the story doesnt really count as such "
"67" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-04-03 " the credits was it my imagination or have they stuck icons of the relevant houses next to each actors name so lena headley had a lion emilia clarke a dragon etc even the directors and grrm had them but i couldnt make these out this is new right ive not just been totally unobservant throughout the first season just had a look at the first episode of season one and they do have the sigils not all are correctly assigned though  the lannisters in particular seem to have recruited some characters from their rival houses the producers should have got a got nerd to check  "
"68" "HuwLyanThomas" 2012-04-03 " the slaying of the innocents was brutal but it had to be we need to see some real nastiness to show just how naive paranoid and scared joffrey is it can only get worse plus what better way of showing gendry  and thus arya  in jeopardy for the episode cliffhanger how slowly their cart seemed to proceeding once you understood whowhat was on their trail very effective the cut from the blacksmith being tortured into revealing that gendry carries a bull helmet to the shot of the bullhelmet itself in the closing scene "
"69" "kneerash" 2012-04-03 " badger1969 good post i think having read the books can only enhance the enjoyment of the show ive read them and wated to re watch season 1 mbefore season 2 started my girlfriend ended up watching it with me she was intrigued by tyrion and i found myself explaining so much to her things like who theon greyjoy is what a gods wood meant to the people in the north who the seven were etc i wasnt complaining i love the sheer epicness of the world martin has created and dont mind one bit jabbering on about it the thing is martins world is so big and detailed that it would take double the episodes and triple the budget to really do it justice overall to date ive found the adaption very good and hopefully it continues i really thought they were going to show the baby being killed a great scene to demonstrate how brutal westeros really is when i try to explain to people how deranged it can be i just tell them the bastard of boltons favourite method of hunting that usually gets a reaction "

"72" "Randomsausage" 2012-04-03 " why doesnt stephen dillane get more big parts he was brilliant as thomas jefferson in john adams and i really liked his take on stannis the part when hes editing the letter to the scribe was hilarious just like my ceo making dufus changes to one of my press releases "

"74" "SarahHughes" 2012-04-03 " i wondered the same  my husband chose not to read the books as he wanted the tv series to be fresh to him and he didnt have any problems with the first episode so i would suggest that theyve done a good job of getting all the new characters introduced without causing mass confusion that said given that the source material is detailed to say the least im interested in how theyre going to squeeze everything into ten episodes "

"79" "badger1969" 2012-04-03 " id echo the thoughts of waterfordgirl   others before her  in wondering if its that much more difficult for viewers who havent read the books to keep up my own decision to carry on reading the books after id finished game of thrones wasnt easy i knew that doing so would mean i would miss out on the shock factor as events unfolded onscreen but in the end i pushed on the jury is still out   probably will be for a few years  on how much knowing the story might detract from certain aspects of onward viewing but in having recently finished rewatching s1  now having seen the first episode of s2 i already see plenty of positives characters that might get very little on screen time  whether just in a particular episode or overall  feel far more significant because i already know them at least a little better from the books i was amazed how much id missed  or at least glossed over  the first time id watched s1 when i went back as more of a fan after reading the first book without giving anything away about specifics i do think that the nature of the story going forward might well mean that there is an ongoing problem in terms of characters getting only limited screen time perhaps they will get round that by having characters disappear entirely for several episodes at a time but in episode 1 we already have 6 major locationsgroups of characters  counting kings landing as just one location  not counting the brief scene at the end at all in future weeks you already have to add at least 3 more  with arya  her group getting a lot more screen time  at least two fairly major characters catelyn  theon being sent off on missions of their own in this episode from the position of knowing all the characters fairly well from the books i liked last nights episode quite a lot it was rather a shame we didnt get more of cressen but his part in the book was only in the prologue  they have to cut a lot out i did take some issue with the fact that he drank first   the affects were obviously fairly dramatic ok so it showed that melisandre wasnt afraid but id have expected more of a reaction from others at the table no queen selyse  except possibly a fleeting glimpse as they left the beach  was also a little disappointing given she seemed to have a big influence all be it mostly from behind the scenes in the books i thought tyriondinklage was terrific as usual  he should be great fun to watch this season like a number of people i didnt warm to sansa for most of s1 but  even before i read ahead in the books  her scenes in the final episode of the last season won me over completely id concur that sandor clegane is a little underused so far i noticed when rewatching s1 after reading the book that they ditched an important scene between him  sansa  gave some of the key dialogue in that scene to littlefinger the fact that hes a regular cast member  as he was in s1  gives me hope the character will be developed "

"87" "5432Hun" 2012-04-03 " pretty impressive return like all first episodes it has to set a number of narrative hares running which only become fully satisfying as the develop and resolve but handled very well i thought really happy to see jerome flynn back as bronn id heard the character wasnt returning glad it turned out to be wrong "
"88" "waterfordgirl" 2012-04-03 " canadians fans here my husband  i were so excited to watch season 2 last night and we enjoyed it very much we did not want the episode to end we have both read the books and remarked and wondered for anyone who had not read the books did they have trouble taking everything in  the condensed arch plots were great and hoped everyone was on board cant want to see more of the starks  mr and mrs stark raised some great kids i would have liked to have seen crastor uglier and would have enjoyed the scene re melisandre and the wine played out more as well it would have given a greater insight as to her true character cant wait to see more of aria sansa jon snow and the hound and most of all tyrion his combination of fairness and intelligence is wonderful as for shae i dont think she is the worst character like all the people in that series they need to play the game to stay alive "
"89" "SarahHughes" 2012-04-03 " i agree with both of you that littlefinger is much more subtle in the books i do have something of an issue with the portrayal and i intend to address that further as the series progresses if it remains problematic that said lauralol i think your assessment re differences in tv books is spot on "
"90" "disgruntledfromyork" 2012-04-03 " i think its really tragic how the guardian chase the us readers… it kind of ruins a blog it being so upandrunning before you arrive at it i know the guardian thinks their future is straddling the liberal uk and us market but the problem is it’s not doing a very good keeping the uk readers happy – admittedly in my view – and just occupies some middle ground where neither party feel particularly well served or rather probably the us don’t really care there are enough readers in the uk if the product is good enough and pockets of excellence aside it seems to me to have been on a generally downward often droney and dull trend for 10 years sadly sorry guardian i think you’re a really important newspaper but you need a major shakeup rethink in my opinion anyway not a bad opening episode considering the amount of exposition etc and makes me think this second season is going to be an absolute cracker and moans aside i’m pleased you’re blogging about it "

"92" "Lauralol" 2012-04-03 " i agree littlefinger is far more subtle in the books and uses his words like a concealed weapon i dont even recall there being any or very little dialogue between cersai and littlefinger in the books however he needs to have more presence in the tv show otherwise how else will his scheming character be portrayed in the books as well as in the tv series littlefinger is a risk taker a medieval stock broker trading on the lives of the wealthy and noble this has to be conveyed more overtly in the tv show than in the books "

"95" "gingerdj" 2012-04-03 " shame they didnt have room for books version of cressens poisioning it was so well written and i think teh appearance of patchface would have brought another level of dark humour agree with some previous posters disappointment by melissandre and craster needed to be more like steptoes dad i think otherwise they did a good job converting and condensing a lot of arch plots for tv and bonus points for spotting tony way as ser dontos hollard  anyone thought hed be older though cant wait to see the greyjoy family "

"98" "DrQuinzel" 2012-04-03 " ah games of thrones back on my tv if only we had more than 10 episodes loved the line about kings springing up in every corner  that does seem to sum up the basic plot of this series much of what i was going to say has already been said but ill give a shoutout to lena headey  yes tyrion and joffrey are the usual scenestealers and were as brilliant as always loving tyrions newfound swagger  i looked for you on the battlefield but i thought cersei was absolutely brilliant in this episode whether demonstrating to littlefinger that power is power or realising that her spoilt son could now actually have her executed although she does look and talk distractingly like keira knightley sent from the near future and poor jon  kit harrington shows up for work all earnest with his surprisingly wellmaintained goatee for a bloke whos been wandering in the wilds only for his entire contribution to the episode to be standing still while repeatedly being called a girl still it gave us a rare example of the world twat being used in the literal sense "

"101" "ManofConstantSorrow" 2012-04-03 " interestingly i thought that the tourney joffrey had played out on the battlements underlined his character whereas his father was happy with a basically honourable joust with a few injuries the unfortunate exsquire aside  though i assume he was effectively assasinated rather than an accidental death joffrey wants people maimed and killed "
"102" "ManofConstantSorrow" 2012-04-03 " if this was got you would be dead on your own sward by now hells teeth is even the grass that dangerous in westeros loving it is it me or did cersei begin to realise last night that she has raised a complete sociapath over whom she has absolutely no control which is why her reaction to littlefinger was so untypical i look forward to seeing how tyrion deals with the little shit the other interesting partnership that seems to be developing is the one between bran and the maester of winterfell who look as though they could become quite a dangerous proposition given time agree with all above about peter dinklage jack gleeson liam cunningham the letter dictation etc etc and especially direwolves not having read the books yet i cant comment on how craster should have looked but i thought it was a wise move to play it slightly against the stereotype having a lovely time playing spotthebrit in the cast we only need sean pertwee to complete the set really "

"160" "MJ1972" 2012-04-03 " smartymcfly i agree that jack gleeson is the real breakout star of the show sure peter dinklage is brilliant but to a large extent this is because of the fabulous lines he is given  lines which were written for him by other people granted he does a great job of delivering those lines but still id say that his success is due more to his dialogue than to his acting whereas jack gleesons joffrey is all about acting the boy is completely loathsome and occasionally terrifying which is quite an accomplishment considering that the makers of the show claim hes an adorable kid in real life im having such a hard time believing that ericbforpm sansa may surprise you over the next few seasons i agree that she was a thoroughly annoying character in season 1 but she was meant to be she was written as a petulant naive and unlikable girl and sophie turner did a great job of portraying her as such however she will grow considerably as a character over the next few seasons id say that of all the characters in the books she shows the most character development it will be interesting to see that reflected on screen "
"161" "MJ1972" 2012-04-03 " ill throw in another vote for posting this blog after the uk showing if nothing else it may stop fans from discussing the show on the guardians general tv blog which is what seems to be happening now i liked last nights episode and thought it worth the long wait true it was heavy on exposition and several characters got very short shrift but it did a good job of setting up the rest of the season i loved tyrions return to kings landing littlefingers shock when cersei demonstrated her kind of power to him and robbs little chat with jaime i also really liked the scene where stannis edits his letter id pictured stannis slightly differently but that scene was perfect i was pleasantly surprised with carice van houtens melisandre there were a few bits in the long trailer that was released last week where i thought she hit the wrong note so i was a bit apprehensive about her involvement in the show despite having admired her in several dutch films she did a fine job though in last nights episode she was feminine alluring and knowing and somehow managed to convey both menace and sympathy not bad the only miss i think was the lack of background information on cressen there was no sense of who he was what stannis meant to him and why his sacrifice was so momentous the makers of the show really should have taken a minute to establish his position im sure it could have been done in his dialogue with davos oh and i would have liked to see slightly more of the hound in the name day scene where sansa says you cant do that only for joffrey to throw a hissy fit and for the hound to protect her if only they could have added two more lines of dialogue there with a few closeups of the joffrey and the hounds faces that scene would have been so much stronger "
"162" "GrayArea" 2012-04-03 " i would agree about shae being a weak character shes a hang up from the books where the point of view structure needs a foil for a character to develop and to provide an outlet for exposition conscious of book spoilers isnt it the case that shae is really a bit of a cypher onto which tyrion against his better judgement projects his lost wifeneed to be loved unconditionally of course being soiaf this leads to "
"163" "SmartyMcFly" 2012-04-02 " i would agree about shae being a weak character shes a hang up from the books where the point of view structure needs a foil for a character to develop and to provide an outlet for exposition i suspect that tyrion is fully aware of the falsity of the relationship  she is a prostitute after all and he has access to one of the biggest piggy banks in westeros thats hardly the foundation for a good loving stable relationship i know peter dinklage is garnering all the plaudits but jack gleeson as joffrey has achieved equally as much fleshing out the shear odiousness of the little squirt and sprinkling him with equal parts spoilt brat sociopath bully joffrey is going to go down as one of tvs pure great villains of the last few years "
"164" "DiamondDag" 2012-04-02 " loved the scene between jaime and robb showed how much robb is growing also dire wolf as another blog put it perfectly it was great to see jaimes bravado utterly melt when grey wind came padding up solid cgi too i thought the writing of the letter about cersei and jaimes incest was a masterful way of showing who stannis is no compromise for courtesy although i suppose they will bend the knee or i will destroy them gets the point across also good start theyve got the plates spinning "

"169" "Simgeo" 2012-04-02 " i have finally sussed out peter dinklages accent as tyrion though hes been watching one foot in the grave apologies if this has been noted elsewhere "
"170" "GrayArea" 2012-04-02 " a few more thoughts tyrion hurrah pd is just going to own this season crastor initially i wasnt sure about the look but on reflection i actually think it makes sense contrast with honourable muddy nights watch and contrast with all his wivesdaughters who obviously do everything while he sits around being loathsome very well played by the actor melisandre nicely understated otherworldly and  as she watches cressen collapse  ambiguous was that a look of pity looking forward to more littlefinger and cersei ambivalent about that scene however i do think that it will end up being the perfect companion to the scene between tyrion and varys that we know is coming unlike cersei those two and lf actually understand power and where it lies and this will show cant wait grey wind wow chomping down lannister sure agrees with you joffrey i hate you i detest you well done "
"171" "Simgeo" 2012-04-02 " i thought the guy playing stannis was excellent and there was a brilliant bit of writing too  making him caustic and pedantic but without being dull with only a few curt sentences he was able to state a large part of his back story without recourse to unlikely longwinded confessions to a prostitute jack gleeson deserves credit for a wonderfully foul joffrey as well thats why the scenes of everyone slapping him are so wellliked ive read the books but must say the massacre of the baratheon bastards came as a shock to me and thats good full marks to hbo and the writers unmissable tv "
"172" "singist" 2012-04-02 " i might have completely imagined this but i swear aiden gillens littlefinger accent was ever so slightly different than last series sort of a tiny bit welsh sounding "
"173" "glitterfairy11" 2012-04-02 " yes i was really annoyed by that it was brilliant last year to only have one ad break i agree about the episode being full of promise too it was very good but clearly paving the way for all the action to come cant wait oh and id just like to wade in and add my vote to those requesting the blog to be posted on a monday again "
"174" "GrayArea" 2012-04-02 " stannis was perfect for me lots of teeth grinding going on there and the letter dictation scene was absolutely pitch perfect "
"175" "Malkatrinho" 2012-04-02 " now that everyones up to speed can i just say that was awesome the hour or whatever simply flew past after waiting the best part of a year for the series to return im finding it hard to wait another week for episode 2 one thing that seemed obvious in this episode was the increased budget last season the meagre dothraki horde the great tourney that looked more like a village fete albeit with horse beheading and various other moments showed the limitations of the tv budget i hope its not just because it was the first episode but the panoramas of kings landing an ominously lit dragonstone keep looming over the beach while the seven burned the icy wastes of the north beyond the wall and the army of the norths night camp were all breathtakingly portrayed while the direwolves were pretty good this time too "

"177" "simonscanlan" 2012-04-02 " another blog hijacked in a desperate attempt to attract american readers thanks again "
"178" "daboiy" 2012-04-02 " didnt think it was very good to be honest though i think the first series was overrated may be because id read all the books beforehand book 5 was crap too since book three 1 2  3 gradually got better and better and better its all gone downhill "
"179" "singist" 2012-04-02 " good question i cant remember from the books but he looked way too neat on tv like he was trying to impress the nights watchhis daughter wives with his trimmed beard and crew cut hes a frigging wildlingpaedodaughterfucker he doesnt give a shit more food in more beard now "
"180" "BlueCalx" 2012-04-02 " great first ep i liked the use of the comet as a motif linking each of the key storylines if it is an omen and it surely is then it is hanging over all of them i thought that both madden and clarke had grown into their roles well madden in particular hes still young but his stance and manner are of someone who has survived and won three battles a change from the slightly scared greenhorn of season 1 the better of the verbal standoffs was him and jaime but baelish and cersei a close second particularly as sarah says it shows the very different types of power they wield the slaying of the innocents was brutal but it had to be we need to see some real nastiness to show just how naive paranoid and scared joffrey is it can only get worse "
"181" "crookedneighbour" 2012-04-02 " i said pretty much unanimous because all the comments were either saying that they thought it would be better to have the blog after the episode airs in the uk or that they didnt care either way i interpreted your original comment as ridiculing the very discussion of this matter rather than expessing a dissenting voice  anyway lets not take this any further its not a big deal either way due to my tiredness i was confused at your attempt at sarcasm and doubted if i did indeed have the correct meaning for the word "
"182" "objectinspace" 2012-04-02 " decent opening but were any other uk viewers infuriated by the number of add breaks on sky atlantic made an already very segmented episode very divided the last scene with cersi and joffery was particularly excellent but it was more an episode of promises of future actions "
"183" "funkymotherpucker" 2012-04-02 " yes i must say that i always imagined him with a beard too was he described as having a beard in the books or do ours minds picture the same man when we think of wildlingpaedodaughterfuckers "
"184" "singist" 2012-04-02 " i loved it all except i didnt think craster was boggy enough lookingacting for a wildlingpaedodaughterfucker i like my wildingpaedodaughterfuckers looking more comicbook villain than that i wanted him to have a big disgusting beard with bits of food in it "
"185" "Lalwende" 2012-04-02 " i liked how the makers of joffslap videos now have a new one to work with "
"186" "Pillowhead" 2012-04-02 " my initial responses are that i really liked the scene they stuck in with robb and jaime especially as we got to see a full grown direwolf the show is really making robb a favourite character for me the guy playing davos looks good but the guy playing stannis just doesnt seem right to me he needs to be bigger and more gnarled i thought melisandre was ok not really seeing the hate i dont know what people were expecting shes a weird red haired woman who may or may not have crazy powers i thought she did alright remembered how much i loathed joffrey all his scenes are excellent and i thought sansa was good im not a sansa lover i must admit but she has had a rough old time and watching her harden and start to understand the subtlety of what her position requires is good to watch crasters keep was ok jon is one of my favourite characters so id like a bit more on this story also craster was too clean and the house wasnt quite foul enough i think the biggest thing i noticed today more so than the first series is they cant possibly get everything in properly its just too big they need 20 2 hour episodes to explain things properly some things are bound to get missed out and watching how they deal with this will be what makes or breaks this series "
"187" "Lalwende" 2012-04-02 " after i sulked for weeks that they didnt pick chris eccleston to be stannis i was quite pleased with him in fact i was pleased with it all except the number of adverts on the first showing on sky atlantic last year theyd only have one ad break per show so it was too intrusive this time around im already looking up when the repeat is on though "

"193" "pollytechnic" 2012-04-02 " i read the first and second books after watching season 1 so in my head i imagined the characters to be just like the actors who portray them got to say i was struggling to imagine robb leading a whole army of loyal people but my word richard madden did a great job in this episode that scene with jaime was so tense and well done and him and grey wind together were pretty threatening i also now have a massive crush on him "

"222" "MattWells" 2012-04-02 " totally agree with absorbantjellyfish  that was a gasp moment when the gold cloaks captain grabbed the knife and plunged it in as for the nudity  well it is a brothel and as camjim24 noted the scene in question was a bit of onthejob training so to speak good to see that the staff are being given some proper career development "
"223" "AbsorbantJellyfish" 2012-04-02 " joffreys an easy character to hate but in my opinion the captain of the gold cloaks was the most loathsome character in last nights episode after watching him carry out cersais ruthless orders to eliminate the late kings bastard sons huge fan of stephen dilane as stannis his square jaw inability to smile and cold yet moral demeanor were portrayed well i still cant warm to shae yes shes playing her own game but shes so unconvincing a player that its hard to believe tyrion would tolerate it although ill allow the possibility that hes aware how fake she is but chooses not to care ive only read the first two novels prior to each season airing but in the beginning of clash of kings tyrion thinks about their arrangement several times hes smart enough to know that he shouldnt trust her but enjoys her company enough regardless to ignore his intuition to those who think that the nudity is explicit or comparable to soft core porn no offense but i think youre just kind of prude several characters work or preside in a brothels nudity and intercourse would obviously be common place in such a location so to acknowledge it isnt necessarily explicit as it is appropriate in terms of establishing the atmosphere did i need that particular scene with ros and the rumbling old maester pycelle last season though no no i did not "

"235" "Woof73" 2012-04-02 " we are publishing it after the us broadcast of the show in order to give american readers a chance to discuss it as soon as it airs it doesnt seem to be working perhaps theyre all off at a us newspapers site posting their comments there which lets face it makes a lot more sense could we try an experiment if there are significantly more comments posted tomorrow than there were today can we move the series blog forward a day "
"236" "ericbforpm" 2012-04-02 " i hope joffreys downfall to be as drawn out and painful as i expect this show to make it zero sympathy with sansa after last series nor particularly the actress who seems permanently set to whimper tad unfair as she will always be compared to maisie williams playing her sister for me aside from tyrion the standout performance in the show "

"238" "tassiegel" 2012-04-02 " a good start i agree that a lot was covered very economically shae doesnt bother me the red woman seemed like bad casting to me not enough simmering power while i dont mind a bit of gratuitous nudity i find the whore house soft porn scenes totally unnecessary and very off putting for the whole series i have to say that i watched the first series without having read any of the books and spent most of the time totally confused this time around ive read all the books and actually found it much easier to keep up "
"239" "pollytechnic" 2012-04-02 " fuck off thread it doesnt even start for another 10 hours "

"244" "mzungoboy" 2012-04-02 " sopranos with swordsgood starti felt the acting in the first few scenes seemed a little wooden but all in all plenty of blood and nudity to keep us looking forward to the next episodeim hooked pity i dont have hbo "
"245" "markthross" 2012-04-02 " no comments yet presumably because everyone switched straight over to mad men a positive orgy of great tv although it is easy to get the characters and stories confused with disturbing results "
