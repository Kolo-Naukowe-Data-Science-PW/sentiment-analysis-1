"5" "TrinityX" 2013-06-10 " sunburst  quite a lot of classical mythology is full of this kind of thing makes me wonder about tolkiens theory about the relationship of mythology and society and how stories reflect the needs of the society in which theyre told paraphrase rather than a quote "

"18" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-09 " sinequanone  one big problem with that in the scene when she reveals she is pregnant we do see the latter she writes its clearly in high valyrian so unless her mother is from essos it would make no sense to write in that language what is translatable has nothing to hide it doesnt mention her mothers name to be hidden either "
"19" "Sinequanone" 2013-06-09 " if you read above i modified opinion to be that talisa was really jeyne but used a pseudonym and that she wasnt an actual spy but was writing back to her mother who was informing tywin "
"20" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-08 " billmilibz  theres no indication in the books that jeyne was pregnant in fact the indication was the opposite so the tv show making it clear that theres no stark heir and removing a frankly ridiculous theory is welcome in my eyes "
"21" "Zoggers" 2013-06-08 " billmilibz  but shes not a spyalso grrm being perfectly happy with the show killing off robbs wife and potential heir means shes she must be pretty irrelevant in the grand scheme of the books as well "
"22" "BillMiLibZ" 2013-06-08 " this talisa being a spy is annoying me they should have kept it closer to books "
"23" "ID958469" 2013-06-08 " are we allowed to discuss anything that happened in the books that has been omitted from the tv series im very curious as to what others who have read the books and been watching the show make of its omission or maybe i just missed it if not please stop reading if we are then thought please in the book before heading to the wedding robb sent a crow to john at the wall with what is implied is instruction that if anything should happen to him then john becomes king of the north lord of winterfell or something totally different "
"24" "DavidLePage" 2013-06-08 " the mob frenzy here attacking sunburst is not much less mediaeval than the episode itself "

"26" "amcalabrese" 2013-06-08 " so i take it talisa was not a spy after all "
"27" "ronanh81" 2013-06-08 " sinequanone  if she was a spy why would she allow herself to get pregnant plan on keeping the child knowing tywin would want it killed "

"31" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-07 " sinequanone  id say unless tywin says talisa was a spy we can assume she wasnt dont forget tyrions first wife and his current whore who tywin has suspicions about but no proof and no idea of identity so hed revel in telling tyrion about how he used talisa and then had her killed just to tie up loose ends "
"32" "Sinequanone" 2013-06-07 " ive just rewatched s02 e04 when robb and talisa first meet when robb and roose first approach her and roose says surely one of our men deserves your attention she says your men are not my men when robb asks her what her last name is she does not give her name and says you want to know what side my family fights on when asked where she is from she says from volantis and even robb seems surprised by that youre far from home if she is really from volantis why does she make the two statements above about your men and my family  maybe she really is jeyne westerling  a vassal house to the lannisters  and was treating her side after the battle when confronted with robb she decided she actually fancied him and came up quickly with another identity reference her words in a later episode i always thought i was a brilliant liar perhaps her letters were not as a spy back to the lannisters but were really back to her mother  a westerling  a fact she still wished to hide and her mother was informing the lannisters thus she was an unwitting instrument of tywin rather then a willing agent and her love for robb was real "
"33" "Sinequanone" 2013-06-07 " this television series breaks rules  dont expect anything to be obvious or predictable "
"34" "Sinequanone" 2013-06-07 " chillingworth 07 june 2013 104pm get ciffix for firefox you are taking this too seriously why do i have to deal with it and why are you so annoyed  we are just discussing a tv program not the political situation in palestine anyway it doesnt have to be confirmed in the show at all  thats one of the clever things in this program  it breaks the normal narrative rules like killing off the heroes and leaving only hints and halfreveals of the plot maybe it will be revealed and maybe not  we might never know for sure  but it is a possibility "

"46" "dsk84" 2013-06-07 " lordtubbington  i recall early on in the books  possibly towards the end of the first one that a potential hint about roose is given i think it was just before the battle of the whispering woods where roose leads the decoy forces and catelyn notes that he is a somewhat frightening man who she doesnt trust entirely whereas there was no reason to believe roose was anything other than dedicated to robb in the tv series till he lets jamie leave for kings landing "

"52" "MRONeill" 2013-06-06 " ignacio puntin  i dont entirely disagree with you  but to be fair tywin has accomplished a whole lot wo stepping outside of kings landing  and bolton as well when it seems that the freys most likely are going to get the brunt of the shame for breaking guests honor i do think that they glazed over winning that battle too quickly  what fighting they showed was very entertaining and i wouldve liked to see more kifill  id be incredibly shocked if the dragons ever turned on dany  she is their mother after all and they seem to be very aware of this fact not to say that kids cant turn on their mothers joffery anyone  but this appears to be quite the bond plus she seems to differ from her some of her ancestors in believing that they cannot be enslavedcontained but i suppose who knows what the behavior of grown up dragons really is  "

"62" "MRONeill" 2013-06-06 " sinequanone  there are all types of violence in reality and in goti see the freys violence as simply that of a dirty old man who isnt very intelligent and certainly doesnt breed intelligent men hence your accurate description of how they were seen  somewhat comical characters you then have joffery and the mystery theon torturer these individuals enact violence because they can and because they get off on it perhaps the mountain is similar here as well although hes more of a plunderrapecause mass havoc  whereas the two above are far more calculating about it i dont think got can be careful about engaging in casual psychopathy  because this is a psychopathic world again in real life too horrible things happen and are done to people  sometimes because someone has created their own justification for it the justification of which is almost always arguable  and sometimes because theyre truly psychopaths which is most usually indefensible "
"63" "MRONeill" 2013-06-06 " thecoordinator  yes i think it was at least initially to save his own arse realizing that it was his men that cut off the kingslayers handsomething its safe to assume that tywin would be quite upset to hear about i mean tyrion is a little monster to him  what use is an average sized son wo his sword hand i think the key to boltons returning jaime was to show that he holds no true allegiances except to himself perhaps he already knew about the plans for the red wedding and therefore of robbs demise  or perhaps he just saw what we saw which is that robb was fighting a losing battle and he then chose the side that in the immediate future would hold the power "
"64" "lemonlace" 2013-06-06 " malkatrinho  please dont read this comment if you havent read the books  dont want spoilers ill try to be ambiguous as possible though not necessarily jeyne could still and i really hope so be in the state fans theorise she might be in the clues in the book were definite and i dont think grrm lays down that kind of groundwork for nothing then again jeyne may well reappear but not in that state benioff and weiss have shot themselves in the feet before and written themselves into corners theyre apparently checking their story lines with grrm and yet last season they wrote shireen out stannis said that he had no children and yet lo shireen appeared this series bw make mistakes i really hope the shows writers have written themselves into a corner again here it seems unlikely that grrm would be influenced by the show and alter plot points that hed already decided upon then again that theory is perhaps far too typical fantasy tropeish for grrm i doubt hed give us hope or a happy ending for one of the relative good guys "

"67" "Spacedone" 2013-06-06 " patchdog  i dont know in the previous episode cersei explained what happened to the raynes of castamere in great detail to then have an episode entitled the rains of castamere seemed to be an unnecessary hint towards what might happen they should have named it something else so that there wasnt a hint until they musicians started playing although clearly it wasnt that much of a hint since so many people missed it so im nitpicking "
"68" "SteveParadis" 2013-06-06 " in case it hasnt appeared yetits been noted that this red wedding is not a patch on the original and best httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvabvwodi8uja "
"69" "sunnyone" 2013-06-06 " lordtubbington  i totally agree with you with regard to getting much much more out of the series if you read the books but were almost at the end of series 3 now so my inclination would be  and was  to humour harry and to hope that he will spend the months between now and the start of series 4 catching up with the booksreading is of course good for everyone but not everyone turns out to be a reader "
"70" "sunnyone" 2013-06-06 " lordtubbington  there was clearly a negotiation between tywin and bolton to arrange for jaimes ransom i think thats just your opinion i dont think theres any proof of this "
"71" "LordTubbington" 2013-06-06 " sunnyone 06 june 2013 841pm get ciffix for firefox because i genuinely think you will get much more out of the series if youve read the books or at least the first three  and reading is good for you and should always be encouraged ok being sarcastic may not be a very persuasive way of achieving this  but i am somewhat lacking in social skills "

"76" "LordTubbington" 2013-06-06 " 5432hun 06 june 2013 209pm get ciffix for firefox really disagree that a stark baby is a bug to the plotters  rather its a feature because they would control it and gain from it a claim to the north and the mere existence of a stark is not a threat as long as its a stark that they control  and on the contrary having no starks and the north falling into anarchy is a worse threat at least for the lannisters who want control over all seven kingdoms "
"77" "LordTubbington" 2013-06-06 " sinequanone 06 june 2013 1215pm get ciffix for firefox if youd read the books youd know assassins are a genderneutral profession on this world and the faceless men may actually be able to change their apparent sex and the seductress idea doesnt wash as tywin with his rather obsessive hatred of whores would hardly for a moment imagine that robb would be dumb enough to throw his whole cause away for one plus talisa is all too clearly just mistress material being a foreigner with no noble connections so again to a tywin it is inexplicable that even a stark would actually marry her otoh tyrion knows whores and knows the starks and must also know the freys as well because hes travelled north and would have stopped at their castle so you can just imagine him coming up with such a plan  but remember he is away in the vale at the time this plot would have been hatched littlefinger knows whores but his motivations are somewhat different to the lannisters as he loves a stark catelyn and has designs on another sansa so this seems convoluted even for him  and in any case if he had an operative as talented as talisa on his books why would he be using roz as his lieutenant as for varys hes very much a balance of power operator  he likes his rivals to be divided and must regard tywin as the most dangerous and so would hardly hatch a scheme that would make the lannisters supreme "
"78" "LordTubbington" 2013-06-06 " 5432hun 06 june 2013 414pm get ciffix for firefox and i was only really talking about when bolton becomes a traitor for bookroose its before duskendale and thus before he gains control of jaime which actually is something of a problem as if he is already a secret lannister all of the interactions between him and jaime are false as he really has no option other than to send him back to tywin  plus he has no motivation to punish brienne at all and would be better off giving her to jaime to curry favour with tywins heir bookroose also has an additional motivation to betray bookrobb as his son has already taken winterfell and the last thing he wants is for bookrobb to lead his army back north and take back control for tvroose there was no duskendale and no immediate threat of robb returning north this means he doesnt have any particular reason to betray tvrobb until after he gains control of jaime  he wants robb to stay in the south and fritter away his forces fighting lannisters and that is in fact tvrobbs plan but having jaime puts him into a negotiation with tywin and the latter simply makes him an offer he cannot refuse this to me makes far more sense than bookrooses betrayal does "

"92" "LordTubbington" 2013-06-06 " sinequanone 06 june 2013 1219am get ciffix for firefox in the books yes jeyne westerling is an unwitting lannister agent because her parents are lannister bannermen and so they connive at her seduction of robb but talisa is not jeyne and if she was a lannister spy and they were aware that she was pregnant with the heir to the north then she becomes a piece of independent value in the game who it would have been worth taking prisoner rather than killing walder frey for instance could have married her off to one of his many spare sons or grandsons and had the baby proclaimed lord of the north  or just sold it to someone else roose bolton could have married her to his son and had the baby turned into his figurehead tywin already has sansa to stake his claim to the north but a spare stark heir would still be useful particularly as he knows sansa has good reason to hate joffrey and that tyrion has a mind and ambitions of his own so talisa superspy really doesnt work "

"94" "LordTubbington" 2013-06-06 " 5432hun 06 june 2013 947am get ciffix for firefox i disagree on that we actually get a whole scene where robb berates edmure for losing just 200 men if bolton had lost most of robbs army in the books its most of the stark infantry so we are presumably talking 50 or 100 times edmures losses in the only real defeat suffered by the northerners in the whole war we would have had to hear about it it is also implausible that even with the freys robbs army would be strong enough to march on and take casterley rock if theyd only recently lost most of the troops hed brought south with him and i forget if that is bookrobbs plan  as hed suffered a major defeat at duskendale wasnt he more intent on reopening communications with the north and opening up a line of retreat there than expecting to actually win the war by this stage plus the tv and books diverge most radically in the robbcatelyn arya and jaimebrienne character arcs particularly in aryas case which is highly also relevant to when harrenhall changes hands and to the course of the war in the region so it is simply not reasonable to assume that every battle and event that is in the books but not the tv show still happens offstage  if it were a more faithful and direct adaptation and i am very glad it is not that would be a valid assumption but it is obviously not "

"98" "LordTubbington" 2013-06-06 " choerilus 06 june 2013 1228pm get ciffix for firefox everyone loves the terms spoiler but nobody really seems to define it imo if something is not stated directly in the books but is very widely discussed as a possibility by readers based on what appears to be many clear but inconclusive hints then it is not really a spoiler and these hints are there in the tv series as well we hear for instance about ned having a sister about rhaegars abduction of her about her father and brothers horrible fate for protesting it about this provoking roberts revolt and usurpation about lyanna dying and about ned bringing back baby jon snow from the war  although any sensible noble with a bastard son would have farmed him out to another relative or friend to raise rather than have bring him home to poison your relationship with your wife all of which could and i would say almost has to generate a rlj theory even for someone who hasnt read the books and as i said george rr martin and the showrunners constantly allude to this theory themselves without actually confirming it in interviews look here they are doing it right here httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvmkzodgraze8 at 330 and it is absolutely clear that the answer to the question who is jons mother that george asked the two wouldbe adapters as a test was not ah just some servant girl so i really do not think discussing rlj is a spoiler for the tv show the summary of the reeds tournament at harrenhall wolf girl meets dragon boy story i posted might however be technically a spoiler as it is at least possible that theyll bore viewers by spending 15 minutes recounting it in a future episode but given the sort of show it is id say the chance of that conversation taking place is so near to zero as to be not worth thinking about at all and even if it is there is nothing in that story which is new to anyone who has looked at the tv show only evidence and has joined up the dots "
"99" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-06 " sinequanone  theres potential for losing a lot more men through reprisals from a splintered army robb needed his whole army at casterly rock so that would have been a total defeat that this is not as for talisa she would have been captured at the very least at casterly rock and they could have dealt with the pregnancy with a lot more subtlety tywin is very good with his subtle plans as he proved with dealing with the sansaloras engagement you fell for the red herring set by benioff and weiss while most people have accepted they were wrong you are still trying to put forward a futile argument "

"104" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-06 " dsk84  yeah i cant think of a characters arc that can be satisfactory changed to cover it believably but a new character sets up problems later in the storyline with the recognising from another character "
"105" "5432Hun" 2013-06-06 " sinequanone  yes but theres a fair amount of confirmation bias in that isnt there i could just as easily start with any other theory and use clips from the show to prove it again im not saying its impossible that she was a spy but all of the evidence could just as easily be used to demonstrate that the writers simply want to put a bit of doubt in our minds to keep us speculating until the payoff of talisa getting killed noones doubting she was killed on tywins orders they all were "
"106" "elsmallo" 2013-06-06 " simonmh  nice poem re sunburst oh dear i dont think youve made very many friends on this forum well im not going to hammer on at you i do frankly watch game of thrones knowing that it is my monday night bit of superior rubbish telly sometimes i shout at the telly oh rubbish and other times i squeal in delight i love this show point being is that it is usually enjoyable i dont buy all the comparisons made with shakespeare and the great works of european history because i think most people havent read any of that really they are just aping what the reviewers customarily write about grrmartin i have read shamefully you might think all of grr he writes good characters even if they are all rather full of themselves and fairly gripping mature fantasy if by that i mean that everyone dies as opposed to everyone somehow doesnt die but all the orcs do dreadfully boring family trees though begat this begat that its worse than the bible yes of course i could have spent the time reading more edifying stuff but i dont feel any shame about this really i have read other things we all have our weaknesses etc i think there is a cultural relativism at work these days which tries to elevate lowculture stuff like got comic books etc by comparing them to the classics and saying look there is also sex and death and violence but i dont generally agree nor do i really agree that it is murder porn though i do find it a bit much at times i think there is something about pride and tribalism and a certain delight in violence yes  but this is certainly a part of some people for it to be porn there would have to be very little else and of course there is some conventional porn in got as well so its fantasybritish character actorsviolencesexy porn all at the same time "
"107" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-06 " sinequanone  she was set up to look like a spy but then if she was a spy it would mean tywin would know of the casterly rock plan could trap robb by the sea with reenforcements like catelyn said was a risk and beaten him on the battlefield which would have been better for lasting power than the way robb was eventually defeated which guarantees reprisals "

"111" "5432Hun" 2013-06-06 " harry72  one more thing worth mentioning one of the the things the book does well in the preceeding chapters is put a lot of emphasis on what is going to happen once edmure is married lots of plans being made lots of motherson anguish about catelyn being separated from all her children in the book the plan for her is to be sent to the mallisters in seaguard the amount of effort invested in those plans encourages us to believe that whatever is going to happen at the wedding there will be an after for robb and his cause so when it turns out there isnt one its more of a shock on tv they did a bit of this by focusing on how robb will once he has the freys back on board attack casterley rock which i thought was well done as far as it went but for obviuous reasons had less capacity to build up our expectations in this way "

"117" "5432Hun" 2013-06-06 " sinequanone  sorry im a bit confused about what youve now changed your mind about whether talisa was a spy or whether the depiction of the red wedding was too gruesome i definitely agree targeting talisas unborn baby was deliberate  both by the architects of the red wedding tywin etc and by the writers within the story any male heir of robbs is a huge problem even if they have him under their control because he is a potential rallying point for the north now that they believe all the male starks are dead sansa is heir to winterfell and her child will be a lannister for the writers talisas death and the manner of it adds a surpriseshock value for many of the audience who already know what is coming ive never been convinced by the idea that talisa is a spy but its always been enough of a possibility that i wasnt sure whether she would survive the red wedding or not for her to be despacthed so traumatically was not exactly a shock to me but it did add a great deal of emoitonal weight to the sequence "
"118" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-06 " grayfox  i think including the jeyne storyline would have given tv viewers more clues about what was going to happen you couldnt just drop her in as a one night stand and robb marrying her so they would have to given her a short introduction which probably would have included her mother conspiring with the lannisters "
"119" "Sinequanone" 2013-06-06 " 5432hun 06 june 2013 133pm get ciffix for firefox now i have seen the evidence that talis was a lannister spy ive now changed my mind a second time i thought the fact she was targeted first and stabbed in the belly killing the child makes more sense if she was a spy if she had told tywin she was pregnant he would have regarded her as death as just as important as robb i dont think anyone else knew she was preganant  unless she had reported that to tywin the whole thing was done under lannister orders  from the playing of rains to boltons words to robb and i think pregnant talisa was targeted under those orders "
"120" "grayfox" 2013-06-06 " anonnyscouse  theyre are some suspicions that jeyne may well have been switched due to contrasting descriptions of her via different pov chapters theres not a lot to go on though and many others feel its just a red herring "
"121" "5432Hun" 2013-06-06 " sinequanone  kind of a bit like the torture of theon  did they take it too far i think it is arguable that theons torture was taken too far although im not personally bothered by it because beyond the fact he has been captured and is being tortured by an as yet unconfirmed person with unknown motives the repeated scenes of torture didnt really move the plot any further we dont need to see it week after week to know that he is being physically and psychologically beaten into something barely human the red wedding is unless we get a very big surprise in ep 10 the key event of s3 and essentially brings to an abrupt and to many unexpected close one of the three main storylines which drive the narrative from the point of neds imprisonment by the lannisters it may have been a bit too graphic for everyones taste but i dont think the violence of the red wedding was gratuitous because it precisely matches the scale of the freybolton betrayal and the extent to which everything is different in westeros now "
"122" "Sinequanone" 2013-06-06 " roose boltons facial expressions  his cruel playing with catelyn  pushing her towards her dreadful realisations are one of the most chilling things in the entire series i think "
"123" "5432Hun" 2013-06-06 " harry72  theres obviously a longer build up with more character detail a couple of important bits on top of sunnys response catelyn through whose eyes we see it all is increasingly suspicious because  grey wind growls and lunges at the freys who greet them on arrival at the twins certain freys who were closer to the straks are absent including one frey son who escorted her on her mission to renly in s2 and a young frey who served as robbs page initially they are not offered bread and salt so she has to ask for it catelyn is suspicious that walder frey would part with his most attractive daughter rather than spitefully make edmure marry one of the ugly ones she confers with the twins maester who reassures her the food is poor fare for such a wedding and the musicians are awful in turns out because they are soldiers which adds to the sense of unease the fates of more named stark bannermen are described greatjon umber is captured smalljon killed marq piper is captured dacey mormant jorahs sister and the old bear jeor mormants daughter is killed etc on tv the only bannerman who is really identifiable apart from bolton is wendel manderly who is the fat guy with a merman sigil catelyn claws at her own face tearing her own flesh in despair before her throat is cut in the book blackfish is left at riverrun so is not at the red wedding be interesting to see what they do with this now its not bolton who catelyn notices is wearing armour but one of the freys to whom she suggests they might dance by this point with edmure wedded she has relaxed a bit all this relates to what weve already definitiely seen theres other stuff but they will probably cover some of it in ep 10 so i dont want to risk spoiling "

"126" "Patchdog" 2013-06-06 " sinequanone  personally i think she appeared on the battlefield to save a shed load of unecessary story in the book robbs real wife does nothing says nothing as it then taken hostage so in the series killing her just ends that plot line "
"127" "5432Hun" 2013-06-06 " sinequanone  while instead i think her murder does not remove the possibility that she was an agent of sorts true and im not completely discounting it because theres many a twist etc but on the balance of probability based on what youve seen do you think that she was we had a similar thing last year with people claiming jaquen was really syrio theres was no real reason to believe this to be the case except their mutual relationship with arya but once the rumour started its impossible to disprove unless jaquen had actually turned round at the end and said oh by the way im definitely not syrio "
"128" "Patchdog" 2013-06-06 " sinequanone  i wouldnt really consider there actions as being that of psychopaths but more bloody politics robb marched south strong he came back weak and had offended walder frey into the bargain he had nothing to bargain with and frey knew it so why not court favour with the lannister also in the book some of his nephews where no longer under robbs protection so he had nothing to lose "

"133" "sunnyone" 2013-06-06 " sinequanone  the line up of the frey daughters and granddaughters made them look worse than crasters lot no wonder edmure was pleased when roslin appeared "
"134" "sunnyone" 2013-06-06 " harry72  one major difference is that in the book roslin edmures bride weeps the whole way through the wedding tv version has her giggling and flirting with edmure so much of the book version is what goes on in catelyns headand its roslins weeping that first begins to cause her disquiet also in the book catelyn makes it clear to robb before they arrive that she doesnt trust walder frey and makes a big thing of telling him not to forget to call for something to eat if its not immediately offered when the bread and salt does come shes reassured that they will be safe in the book the musicians play very badly  because theyre not really musicians and robbs wife  who is jayne westerling  is not there at all because catelyn and robb agree that this would be rubbing walder freys nose in it "
"135" "5432Hun" 2013-06-06 " sinequanone  but those things are easily explained without her being an agent  she was killed because shes robbs wife  she popped up conveniently on a battlefield because thats the best way the writers having dispensed with the westerling subplot as too complicated came up with of introducing her character  she was writing a letter to her mother precisely as you say to hint that she might be part of a plot but in fact it was in the end just a letter to her mother i agree grrmwriters are very good at leaving little hints and ambiguities to get us wondering and i could be wrong  maybe next episode tywin will have a good laugh about how he set robb up with talisa but then killed her because she went native but i still think the most likely interpretation of what weve seen is that talisa was playing robb straight we were just teased into thining she might be part of the plot "

"207" "LordTubbington" 2013-06-05 " diamonddag 04 june 2013 615pm get ciffix for firefox sadly i dont think rickon can be aged up sufficiently to play a role precisely because so much of the cast are children or teens ageing in real time each season does represent a westeros year and overall the whole epic cant really be dragged out for more than 7 or 8 seasons max so while arya and bran will be adults by the time of the final climactic battle of ice and fire in say 4 or 5 years time rickon will still be a snotnosed kid and realistically the others will probably be over the wall in season 6 and dany has to have fully grown dragons and to have marched across the eastern continent by then and if we dont eventually get dragons and dudes with flaming swords and giants and teenage ninja uberassassins and a whole warged menagerie led by hodor vs ice zombie hordes then i will feel profoundly cheated "

"225" "DiamondDag" 2013-06-05 " ignacio puntin  i see where youre coming from shes not had an easy life but the problem is we compare her to the horrific stuff going on in westeros and characters like arya the thing about dany is shes basically winging it with no experience of leadership or war she has to rely on pure instinct quite often schemes and the future threat of her dragons are all she has admittedly those dragons help a lot thats why ive always got respect for her even as she does become more imperious and a bit pompous because shes out on her own making huge decisions with only a couple of grizzly old men as advisers i know theres a huge difference in their circumstances but shes done better than robb with none of his privileged up bringing or support as for the discussion about emilia clarke i just cant agree with the detractors im not going to pretend shes one of the strongest performers but hun shes far from the weakest thats just crazy talk for me sophie turner and kit harrington have been far far more disappointing i think sophie turner has been the weakest from the start but admit sansa is a hard one to play i think emilia clarke has stepped up on the big occasions and i think this series has been her strongest partly because dany is also becoming a stronger role "

"238" "LordTubbington" 2013-06-05 " nickc909 05 june 2013 410pm get ciffix for firefox there was clearly a negotiation between tywin and bolton to arrange for jaimes ransom while this was going on jaime was recovering from rather brutal surgery to save whats left of his arm and would hardly have been involved in the negotiation about his own fate with the master of the man who took his sword hand even if hed felt up to it and then we see jaime riding off to kl changing his mind rescuing brienne from the bear and then presumably taking her back to kl even if jaime was disposed to plot the downfall of the starks its difficult to see at what point hed have those conversations  whereas presumably there are ravens and messengers being constantly exchanged between the twins harrenhall and the tower of the hand all this while remember the ravens and cyphers give very rapid and secure communications by medieval standards that in the book bolton says greetings from jaime lannister to robb as he stabs him doesnt necessarily imply jaime was personally involved in the plot  although his arrival at harrenhall as a prisoner almost certainly set the whole sequence of events off and as regards jaimes motivations robb kept him in a cage living in his own shit under constant threat of death for a year so hed be more than within his rights to exact vengeance and as a lannister slaughtering the whole stark army who have presumably been personally beastly to him over that year would hardly cause him any qualms at all but catelyn did release him at great cost to herself and the stark cause provided him with an escort who saved his life and he is bound by oath to return her daughters to her so given his rather twisted but real sense of honour that would complicate matters for him and grand plots like this one are clearly not jaimes style at all  but certainly are tywins "

"255" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-05 " lordtubbington  ill have to watch again but didnt roose take his coat off before stabbing robb it would have been suspicious especially in the outside camp if all the boltons were in full dress mode with sigils etc the gold cloaks are the city watch basically the police of kings landing we havent had much to see with them since season one littlefinger used them to betray ned tyrion did sack the leader and replace him with bronn while hand but we never saw the actual gold cloaks in action is season two and they havent really been mentioned in season three "

"262" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-05 " katkinsy  dont feed the troll the reason they post comments like that after every episode is the reaction they get "

"264" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-05 " lordtubbington  not every frey knows every bolton and viceversa so chainmail would work as an indicator that they are on the same side as its unlikely the starks and other northmen wuld be wearing chainmail "

"283" "VonSparron" 2013-06-05 " forgot to mention  really liked the houndarya bits they are having a bit of fun verbal sparring but then the look on his face when she tells him that one day shes going to stab him in the eye is great he can see that she means it and is totally capable of doing so "

"289" "Jeffrey Mallouk" 2013-06-05 " anonnyscouse  thanks for the reply i thought its also something that relies to the lannisters hes such a coward how did he expect that there will be a battle when everyones throat was cut while they were sitting  "
"290" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-05 " jeffrey mallouk  chain mail basically what you wear when you are about to go into battle "

"292" "FundamentalistGoblin" 2013-06-05 " thenorthremembers  i wouldnt neccasarily say that she wasnt a lannister spy given that she had a stark inside her i can easily see tywin wanting to tie up loose ends "
"293" "SarahHughes" 2013-06-05 " sunnyone  oh ive always seen it as a bit of veiled courtesy ie send my regards to your father as long as you send mine to robb stark i dont think jaime intends bolton to go off and kill robb and i do think its clear that roose is the killer but rather to suggest that he knows roose is playing a double game and thats partially why i really dont like the change because it loses a layer if its any old lannister "
"294" "OxIan" 2013-06-05 " guardiansek  i think theyve succeeded in pissing off the neighbors now so i expect that they will be dialing the lannister 911 number someday whether anyone picks up the other end is another matter a lannister always pays his debts although i understand they can be quite creative about whether a debt is actually due and the manner of the payment "
"295" "VonSparron" 2013-06-05 " lordtubbington it is a shame we didnt see the greatjon cracking frey skulls with his bare hands before going down in a hail of crossbow bolts but the actor had other commitments so cant really blame the producers for that one try as i might "

"297" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-05 " oxian  haha good spot pedantry of my own on my own post it was elementary not sherlock she played irene adler in sherlock had lara pulver now in da vincis demons in that role "
"298" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-05 " benjyuk  its about westeros its people either living there or in exile are incidental westeros continues without any of them as long as white walkers can be beaten "
"299" "OxIan" 2013-06-05 " anonnyscouse  natalie dormer has done a number of sherlock episodes and a uk series called the fades needless pedantry the best sort on my part but the fades was first shown in 2011 and natalie didnt appear in got until 2012 "
"300" "RantingBoy" 2013-06-05 " initially i wasnt sold on game of thrones and only started watching it for sean bean but once i got over the slightly tacky element and i think its got way better since season one i started to really get into it i would agree that there is a lot of sexnudity and sometimes what seems to be deliberately titillating violence and being honest its the violence and sex that in part makes it entertaining obviously the political power struggles displaced characters multiple quests plots conspiracies forced marriage the issue of gender disability incest friendship enemies enemies joining forces friends betraying friends enemies saving enemies lust love honour bravery pride you know just about every standard theme found in classic stories yeah theres that but mainly its fun medieval murder porn that keeps me coming back "
"301" "sunnyone" 2013-06-05 " sarahhughes  im with you on this one sarah i think it makes a big difference whether or not he says the lannisters or jaime lannister and i agree that it should have been jaime as in the book implicit in the books description of robbs murder is that it was roose bolton who murdered him but we had to work it out for ourselves however i dont agree that jaime meant it in a lets move on way but as a veiled threat lannisters and starks are still at war and as far as jaime knows robb would not want to hear that roose had jaime in his custody and sent him back to kings landing "
"302" "Docemmetbrown" 2013-06-05 " still in complete shock from this episode  i even knew a little spolier  ie rob died but totally forgot whilst watching itthe only improvement i would of made is that coldplay idiot turned the crossbow on himselfall that aside just amazing didnt see any of it coming and certainly not so brutal loved the bran osha hodor scene glad jon snow showed his true colours  may he does know something after all "
"303" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-05 " sarahhughes  i just reread the chapter it doesnt say its roose bolton who kills robb it just says a man in black armor and a pink cloak i may be wrong but i dont think its explicitly mentioned that roose did anything other than arrange it as you say roose saying jaime lannister sends his regards would link back to that conversation so i think the slight change has helped the lannisters could mean jaime but it could also mean tywin cersei tyrion or even joffrey "
"304" "BenjyUK" 2013-06-05 " and that isnt a spoiler  its an assumption of mine "
"305" "FundamentalistGoblin" 2013-06-05 " gjsmith  you missed a lot of foreshadowing then hell he beats you over the head with it in one of the first chapters when they find a direwolf killed by a stag the books are suprisingly subtle you pick up a lot more on a second reading especially when youve read the later books too "
"306" "BenjyUK" 2013-06-05 " the game of thrones was never truly about robb or catelyn stark just as it was never about ned or never will really be about cersei joffrey or even tywin and certainly not fucking ollenna tyrell "
"307" "5432Hun" 2013-06-05 " lordtubbington  part of this problem is that emilia clarke has no charisma at all  she should project power and passion i think she has got a bit better but she is probably the weakest actor in the show admittedly shes up against some heavyweight competition interestingly tamzin merchant was orginially cast as dany but pulled out she would have been great not only is she a better actress but she shares the same long facial structure as harry lloyd who played visarys which would have given their relationship an extra creepiness tamzin merchant beautiful as emilia clarke undoubtedly is she has much more cartoonish looks and very obviously collar and cuffs dont match if you follow my meaning "
"308" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-05 " doncobaino  not all of it theres plenty of stark bannermen and theres still living starks who although young now will still remember "
"309" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-05 " mzorin  well robert isnt that old cant remember if lysa is older or younger than catelyn was but its only a couple of years either way pretty sure ned spoke of his desire to have another child with catelyn while planning to go back to winterfell after resigning as the kings hand "
"310" "SarahHughes" 2013-06-05 " anonnyscouse  although actually this is my one big annoyance about the episode because its jaime lannister sends his regards in the book  which as weve seen he did when he left roose but he meant it in a lets try and put all this behind us and move on way and roose twists that and its actually quite important here endeth my pointless book huff "

"313" "anonnyscouse" 2013-06-05 " nickc909  in fairness this is the first time we have been able to discuss the character change made in the tv series properly theres always going to be the temptation to compare the tv version of one of the most important scenes in the series to the book version i agree though there has been far too much talk about things that have only been in the books i can only advise reporting the posts sarah cant be expected to spot every spoiler in 1330 comments "
"314" "5432Hun" 2013-06-05 " zombiedeadhead  my view is that its interesting and relevant to discuss how the tv writers have adapted the books it can also reply to nonbook readers who ask for clarification of plot points as long as we are only discussing parts of the story which have already been covered on tv and not foreshadowing future events then i dont see the problem by the way i have read the books and so has clariana "

"634" "Chillingworth" 2013-06-04 " singist  i agree with you completely ive been telling all my friends how this would be the best series so far because so many of the best scenes of all of the books come in the first part of a storm of swords although part 2 is great too i was talking about without naming scenes like jamies hand brienne and the bear the death of mormont climbing the wall but most of all i was making reference to the red wedding i was the same as you at first was thinking this scene is going to be so great itll blow peoples minds however as we got closer to it ive become increasingly apprehensive until im almost embarrassed to say like you i was having dreams about it last week last nights episode was almost worse compared to when i read it in the book because i knew what was going to happen it completely hung over the whole episode and i reckon i missed a lot of the dialogue because i was too busy worrying about it to concentrate to be honest i dont even think i could go back and rewatch the episode as i usually do or if i did id stop it before the end the bit with talisa was unbelievably brutal and i feel as though that image has been tattooed on my brain just now the show runners really pulled of a great trick by getting her killed at the wedding and in the manner that she was ie first and most horrifically since robs wife doesnt go to the wedding in the book i thought that she might still make it away alive i actually had a horrible feeling that after his sleazy comments to her walder frey was going to keep her alive for his own pleasure however killing her first and in that manner was a massive shock even for someone like me who was already braced for the absolute worst about to happen i almost feel that bienhoff and weiss made a bit of a statement with her death too of all the changes theyve made from book to tv the talisa storyline has probably earned them the most criticism unfairly in my opinion  jeyne westerling is more a cardboard cutout than a character they almost seemed to be answering some of their critics with talisas death daring even the most outspoken not to feel some regret at not giving her a chance while also showing that the changes they make dont always result in a dumbing down or softening of the original story im glad its over now anyway and we can begin to focus on how things pan out postwedding for all the characters i think that now the wedding is over the tv story might start to divert a lot further from the books i for one am looking forward to seeing where it goes from here "

"719" "OrpheusLiar" 2013-06-04 " clariana  good points but there is a sense not just of summer ending but of an era the targaryens unified things and brought an unprecedent era of peace for 300 years they also modernised westeros in that time the old ways have died out the starks and the northmen descend from the first men their ways are the old ways the heart trees and the old gods there is a sense to me at least that the coming cataclysmic battle between the others and realm of men will be the last stand of the old ways the magic of greenseeers and the children of the forest against the others "

"751" "Jonnytheshirt" 2013-06-04 " diamonddag  as a book reader i view the adaptation as a different beast with great challenges these books are read voraciously due to martins fast chapters and writing yet expansive in their scope and so much there is to fit in in the series i seen great depth and detail in every action and line delivered its very well thought out i think and while some elements are lost i still think a good job is being done "
"752" "jennifera30" 2013-06-04 " anonnyscouse  ah i thought they meant vargo hoat totally forgot about varys im especially fond of the way that danaerys is portrayed in the audio books mrs doyle from father ted oh and how tyrion is the only lannister to be full on welsh "

"760" "Clariana" 2013-06-04 " orpheusliar  i wouldnt say jon is ever comfortable with deceit but its just that early on he realises it can be a deeper form of loyalty insofar as ayra goes i agree the starks believe their honour elevates them above the other families instead it pulls them down like quicksand until they are suffocated by it i think the crux of the matter is that the starks are in the wrong season this is the end of summer when the games and the tourneys are being played out the starks are not natural players and never have been doesnt mean to say they cant learn but that is not their primordial nature now when winter fks you hard moderator tis a quote from the book  then the starks come in to their own their toughness fairness loyalty that is the sort of leader you want in hard lean times thats why therell always be a stark in winterfell because if there isnt westeros will die "

"794" "OrpheusLiar" 2013-06-04 " chinofjim  yeah its interesting the historical parallels are there but i wonder how much of it is intended some of it is overtly historical while other things are just approximate so we may be seeing what we want to see i have a friend who is convinced robert baratheon was meant to be henry viii and cersei anne boleyn but then historical relevance also seems to vary by location kings landing obviously appears to be anglo saxon and the most closely related to british history where as events north of the wall seem more in line with norse mythology and the north appears to be vaguely celtic in its symbolism without having any obvious historical reference other than the wall itself which has an obvious real world echo of hadrians wall i think martin has probably borrowed heavily from all of the above for certain aspects and bits and pieces will resonate without ever having a clear overall real world equivalent "

"1019" "grazieroma" 2013-06-04 " whoa have not read the books so mine is a limited perspective i must admit i never thought much of the starks ned is paradigmatic an overblown sense of honour which manifests in a series of increasingly poor decisions which lead to the utter devastation of is family i have never been sympathetic to the notion that he is a man out of time as if the stark sense of honour would have ever allowed that family to rise to its position of power ned was wholly ineffectual always a step behind those around him and making crucial errors when it mattered most ie his clemency for cersei the pike was an inevitability robb was always a pretender never a contender as nicely encapsulated in the review above and catelyn acted primarily on the basis of revenge and desperation releasing jaimie has been a great plotline for growing his character but was another lockstep toward her familys demise where was the honour in forcing her son to marry into the loathsome frey clan it was a matter of strategy pure and simple and she further misjudged his petty vindictive character in short all the starks who were never really in the game to begin with have been dispatched bran on the other hand is clearly a rising star such jedi mindtricks will be handy when dealing with dragons who knew arya becomes less annoying and more impressive each episode i look forward to her growing alliance with the dog jon snow he will spill bood for sure likly that of the grotesque frey but abandoning ygritte is another typical stark move foolish and with dire ramifications wow i did not set out to excoriate the starks so soon after their demise and im in shock to be honest one of tvs bloodiest and most devastating set pieces ever and i do mourn talisa who was a beautiful and honourable character that deed alone will not go unpunished game of thrones has upped its game considerably this year it is in a world of its own and im so grateful we get to visit epic "
"1020" "Greenseer" 2013-06-04 " well ive had wine wiped away my tears and am ready to post i have to applaud the show runners here for introducing talisa i know she hasnt been a favourite across the fandom i didnt mind her but as a book reader knowing the red wedding was coming i think the brutal stabbing of little unborn ned was a gutwrenching touch well done dave and dan i also couldnt help but appreciate the artistry in this scene before the carnage broke those candles the setting of the tables the lighting was magnificent i thought i was in the middle of a caravaggio painting i notice little things like this i remember when i read this scene in the book a couple of years ago now i have been reading books for 52 years and ive read em all  especially as i devoured horror fiction in my teens the chapter itself was clumsily written im sorry fanboys it was and it was not the carnage that stood out for me such things have been done better in countless other books ive read the one thing that haunted me from the rw was catelyns grief at seeing her firstborn killed before her eyes as a mother of a young man myself that has stayed with me i am so glad the show highlighted this with michelles heartrending plea to walder frey so the wedding lived up to expectations for me because it dwelled on cat and talisa  women who pay the price for mens lust for power and the mistakes that even the honourable make sometimes just one last point on the wedding scene however apart from the brutal stabbing of talisa there wasnt a great deal of gore here those complaining about gore really need to watch the sequence again yes we had two throatslittings but very little blood ensued compare this to the hounds rescue of sansa last season when bowels were dragged out at the twist of a sword but if the scene seemed more bloody than any other that is to the credit of the production horror was brought to us by the reactions of the characters thats good tv as to the rest of the episode i am the worlds biggest dany fan but i thought the yunkai scenes were intrusive tonight in what was essentially a starkcentric episode this isnt helped by my loathing of daario naharis as a book reader and the show hasnt made him any the more palatable to me but even so i just felt that danys scenes detracted from the inevitable forward movement of the action which had a hint of greek tragedy sadly the show did not offer viewers a line about the meaning of bread and salt under a hosts roof again a tradition of guestrite that goes back to the greeks although they showed robb and his party partaking of this i wonder how many viewers picked up on this tradition which made freys betrayal all the more heinous a small nitpick however i loved the queenscrown sequences at long last all those viewers moaning about bran and his boring storyline got to see that er well maybe this young lad has a real part to play by god does he have a part to play talk about starks you may just have witnessed the most powerful of the starks in action affecting a story arc doesnt always mean wielding swords and plotting politics the further separation of the two younger starks was heartbreaking too a human touch in what will prove to be a much deeper storyline as far as bran is concerned its very difficult for me to comment further on the actual storyline as a bookreader without spoiling but i am looking forward to the finale when hopefully we will see the fallout of the red wedding in kings landing and across the realm "

"1425" "rickylee369" 2013-06-03 " blimey i was looking forward to the huge battle for casterly rock as the series finale i imagined that this episode would be a steady build up to the first major encounter between the lannisters and the king of the north maybe with a small cliffhanger at the end to whet our appetites for the big set piece and then wow it is apparent that winter is coming this was a total shock it is a well known saying that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned you should meet the father after the invitation to a consolation prize of a wedding rob stark and his retinue are forced to endure walder freys bitter barbs the king emasculated allows himself and his pregnant wife to be subjected by the sleazy verbal volleys of the grizzled lord weakened and desperate for an ally to swell his armies dwindling numbers rob debases himself by standing idle to these insults a true king your grace would have made his apologies and then reminded his audience who the boss is say what you like about the demented throwback on the iron throne despite his simple diseased mind and his innate cowardice he and his family would have made sure those slurs were answered by blood we now know this to be evident we saw what the lannisters are capable of given the right opportunity of course the build up to the mass slaughter was well executed no pun intended and the fact that rob and his mother had made up that the wedding ceremony went off without a hitch and edmure was overjoyed to obtain an attractive new wife though far too young for him even in the world of historical fantasy i liked the way that catelyn reminisced about eddard and witnessed the true affection between her son and his queen i also for the briefest of moments thought that she might one day settle down with the blackfish foolish i know but he wasis a good and honourable man and i thought they looked good together oh well as the hired band good but expensive hardly surprising with the drummer from coldplay performing apparently he also does barmitzvahs provided a beautifully ironic accompaniment the first casualty was the newly named heir to the north baby eddard the bloodbath arranged in a way to inflict as much emotional loss as possible grandson son mother this was no simple assassination this was brutal revenge designed to remove all hope before the last breath is drawn death becomes welcome such is the agonised screaming of freshly shattered souls and then the tragedy of a lost child seeking her mother poor arya as the hound had mocked her earlier fear of not getting to her family the closer they appeared to be his words proved eerily prophetic cruelly denied the opportunity to reunite or say goodbye this brave and wounded childs journey continues under a fresh veil of grief the respect for arya from the hound though unspoken is slowly becoming apparent and their relationship now is going to be pivotal i think her hatred for her new travelling companion might fade as their journey continues of course it is not all about the wedding although there was nothing to be seen of kings landing there was more than enough going on in the north to keep us occupied bran has seen jon snow leave ygritte through the eyes of a direwolf and the world through the eyes of hoder he also parts company with his young brother and his wildling friend jonah is miffed by daarios attentions towards his queen yet they fight together with grey worm the unsullied kick ass in an excellently choreographed scene to sack a city and free all the slaves left living mackenzie crook dies there is death every where you look cant wait for next week if it is even half as good as this it will be epic "

"1512" "UninventiveName" 2013-06-03 " sunburst  if you feel ashamed to watch it i suggest you dont watch it you should also probably stop commenting on it i fail to see whats cheap or shallow about an event such as the red wedding the whole setting for game of thrones is that of a medieval power struggle and events like that did happen in our history what i find interesting about game of thrones is that it really does feel like an alternate history i suppose in large part because a lot of real historical events are cherrypicked and reimagined there was a good article about this in the guardian a few weeks ago comparing among other events the battle of blackwater to the use of greek fire by the byzantium empire against the attacking arab fleet i guess the obvious inspiration for tonights episode was the black dinner which i remember learning about in standard grade scottish history when a load of clan douglas chiefs were slaughtered after being invited to a feast so i think to say its murder for the sake of murder well in the context of the programme its murder for the sake of power which is ultimately what the shows guiding idea is a power struggle its a bit much to claim that its cheap or shallow when it has actual historical precedent "

"1556" "DiamondDag" 2013-06-03 " i think the review over at westerosorg managed to convey my feelings quite well without me stumbling for the right words so there’s an orgy of violence yes there’s a brutality yes but all these things are relatively easy to do on the screen if you have the money and the extras for it the dread and unease that builds throughout—those are harder things to achieve a matter of establishing atmosphere of subtly urging viewers into a position of tension while the red wedding of the show was effective as a “shocker” it simply doesn’t live up to what it might have been to what martin put on the page and which readers went through those who are blessedly ignorant of the fiction will doubtless be over the moon with paroxysms of shock and perhaps they who are the vast majority of viewers after all are all that really matters but it could have been so much more than it was they aimed low and so armed with martin’s masterful storytelling to provide the basic outline they passed the bar with some ease but they did not aim high and at the end that failure in ambition is something i fault them for i dont agree with all of it the idea that they aimed low seems like a cheap shot at the producers i just think they went all in for the shock value they made sure it was a big moment in tv and none of that makes it bad but it wasnt what i was hoping for maybe i was expecting too much but it didnt quite have the emotion and horrible sense of dread to go along with the shock and brutality the build up of tension and then violent release made that chapter in the book unbearable to read i think by removing all hints of foreboding they lost some of that having said all that there were individual bits i loved david bradley was superb as walder frey what a horrible old wretch and as someone noted above i loved the sly smile on rooses face when cat noticed his mail grey wind being killed in his kennel was just sadistic from the writers no heroic last stand for him as for michelle fairley despite her heart wrenching bargaining with walder her final scream of anguish and gormless look as her throat was cut was a bit much for me great performance aside from that away from the red wedding i thought the rest of the episode was solid having bran and jons stories cross paths lent them both extra depth theyve been lacking keeping brans group together has paid off brilliantly as we got an emotional parting between bran and rickon and how satisfying was it seeing jon show his hand and make a break for it ygritte looked pissed yeah we couldve done without the yunkai bits but it meant we got a bit of a badass fight scene my vote goes to grey worm btw "

"1589" "guardiansek" 2013-06-03 " my thoughts on this week 1 i knew that the red wedding was coming but it was still carried off well robb has been a good but not great character and i knew he was making a mistake when he wed talisa but its sad to see him talisa and caitlyn go i have to respect got for not being afraid to kill off major characters and storylines 2 game of thrones theoryif someone is named or is about to be named eddard is a kiss of death 3 good scenes with maisie williams as always i wonder what she and the hound will do now i wonder why the hound saved her when he probably realized that this was the end of his chance to ransom her now hes stuck wandering around westeros with a sullen teenager that hates his guts i doubt this is going to turn into some kind of hollywoodstyle redemption through foster fatherhood story  4 i dont think the scene with sam and gilly was wasted they have to move that storyline along somehow and i dont think that expanding the stark scenes in this episode would have helped much 5 i think the best scenes were with bran and rickonoona going their own ways so i guess we get three stark children road trips now rickon has had so little to do in the last three seasons until last night you could probably put his lines on a post card hopefully the little guy will be given something more to do now 6 id say the least favorite part of the episode was jorah gray worm and dario on their commando mission it just didnt strike me as right somehow that we went from dozens of guards storming in to them showing up in dararius tent to say mission accomplished actually keep sam and gilly and postpone the dany  company conquest of yunkai until next week and give it more time then meanwhile finish up red wedding loose ends like what happened to blackfish and the hound and arya escaping the mess "

"1599" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2013-06-03 " wonderful wonderful episode completely blown away by it although i knew what was coming and thus thought the show couldnt match the mental images generated by the book it surpassed all my expectations michelle fairley was spectacular in this episode  from her pride at being accepted back into robbs counsel to even allowing herself some joy and happiness to her immediate cottoning on to the trouble ahead to her primal scream and acceptance of her fate she was simply brilliant so too was maisie williams as ever utterly heartbreaking but also quite scary at the same time  the threat to the hound was chilling i really hope she becomes the ultimate badass we expect her to i really enjoyed the advancing of the bran arc jon snurrrrs chunk lacked a bit of oomph but sam and gilly in just a couple of minutes fo screen time once more played off each other beautifully how to top this in episode 10 is it even possible i have my suspicions as to what will happen next given the theme is mhysa mother which could likely include the bringing forward of another setpiece event "

"1604" "dsk84" 2013-06-03 " wow despite having read the books i had goosebumps and was shaking for about 30 mins after the brilliantly silent credits rolled i recently received a few messages from a cousin who hasnt read the books and hes clearly in shock im not the type that would ruin a moment like this for anyone so i wasnt going to reveal any spoilers though i did want to drop the bomb on my brother as he told me about ned stark getting executed before i saw the episode sadly he had spoiled it for himself so i didnt get that pleasure back to the episode seeing what happened to talisa was a massive shock i didnt really like her character but seeing an unborn baby murdered like that was brutal catelyn instantly realised something was amiss when lame lothar closed the door and rains of castamere started playing and her scene with roose bolton was brilliant that man is so deviously dangerous her killing off walders wife was probably better than her killing off jinglebell as walders reaction here spoke more about him than the part in the book ever did the scene with daariojorahgrey worm was so bad ass though i imagine it will to a large extent be forgotten due to the wedding all three were incredibly impressive with their fighting skills though grey worm certainly did come out on top as someone who is a fan of ser friendzone it was quite wrenching seeing his reaction when dany asked him about daario dany feared the worst seeing his reaction not realising what sort of an effect her affection for daario is having on jorah glad they decided to split up the younger starks as well i wasnt quite sure where they were going but they finally seem to have brans story heading in the right direction was yet another moving scene between the two brothers though nothing quite matches catelyn at the end "
"1605" "JamesH91" 2013-06-03 " ryan brighton  the red viper is my favourite character in the book really excited to see who they cast as him alexander siddig is the name most frequently mentioned and id be delighted with him to be honest "
"1606" "Cariad007" 2013-06-03 " michelle fairley was fantastic in this episode that moment when bolton stabs robb and she lets out a cry of pure anguish as she cuts the throat of freys wife you just know shes thinking that as far as she knows almost all her children are dead youd have to be stonehearted not to be moved by that "
"1607" "DireStraights" 2013-06-03 " i have read all of the books so i knew this was coming as soon as i saw the name of this weeks episode i did however refrain from spoiling it for anyone with that being said i was utterly stunned after seeing it excellent acting all round from the lecherous walder frey to the turncoat roose bolton "

"1610" "singist" 2013-06-03 " englishdisco  for me knowing it was coming made it worse when the season began i was all yeah red weddings gonna be the shit but over the weeks i just felt more and more apprehensive i was actually glad about the two week break as id worked myself up into such a state about it i didnt actually think i could bear it i was having bloody nightmares about it "

"1614" "JamesH91" 2013-06-03 " that was so so good knew it was coming last night i felt like a child on christmas eve and when i woke up i was like its time but damn it still hit me like a brick just sat there for about an hour trying to digest it obviously the final scene will be the main talking point for the next well year but the whole of the episode was beautifully constructed the dany parts werent necessary this week and seem unfairly overshadowed poor iain glenn but they were still pretty good i just loved the subtle touches especially between the blackfish and edmure the little looks they had when inspecting freys daughters cracked me up no end revealing that they were going to name the child eddard though that was what got me the most heartbreaking outstanding "
"1615" "DolleDolf" 2013-06-03 " singist  i thought it was actually not that great having just recently been fed on a diet of superbly staged spartacus combat which is imo better staged and certainly better timed i felt the battle was a bit of a let down the different fighting styles were overdone i felt 1970s hong kong kung fu movie "

"1617" "EnglishDisco" 2013-06-03 " despite knowing this was coming for some time having read the books it really didnt make it any easier the writers choice of including talisa jeyne in the books was a smart move as it gave the readers someone new to mourn for  adding to the impact i remember in the books when i realised that robb had left jeyne at riverrun i was relieved for her  but when i saw her standing in walder freys hall in yesterdays episode i wretched winter is coming indeed "

"1620" "DolleDolf" 2013-06-03 " id4655392  well i actually did we have been bombarded with messages about having to expect unexpected endings and main characters being written off so for this season i was kind of expecting robb stark to get it just about the only remaining palatable character of the lot and of course his wife the only woman with actual transferrable skills as opposed to being a pretty face or a breeding machine which of course in a medieval society is quite correct next season it will probably be the imp the other main character that is still somewhat likeable my prediction is that john snoa stark with ditch the snow name adopt the stark name and rally the north after all all the other remaining starklings are too young i hope that awful old pervert gets the theon treatment just in case i am right i did not read the books this was not entertainment to me if it werent for my so looking sad when i said that i had had enough and would not watch it with her anymore i would bail out i enjoyed spartacus so much more blood swords nudity galore but a great notsoconvoluted story and a heroic main character and various other easytoidentifywith secondary characters "

"1636" "Ryan Brighton" 2013-06-03 " i agree the dany segments could have just been cut although grey worm was surprisingly lethal with that spear are we not getting the revelation of jorahs betrayal then its a fairly important plot point i cant see how they can avoid it a book reader so knew full well what was coming but it was still a bit of a shocker to see it played out walder freys twisting the knife right from the very beginning by lecherous insults knowing robb needed him was excruciating to watch you did it for firm tits and a tight fit etc he did get all the best lines in the episode although roose comments about choosing a fat wife so he could get her weight in gold was quite funny too i forgot rickon could even talk to be honest but yeah his scene with his brother was a bit of a tearjerker are they going to write something for him and osha or are they going to disappear for the rest of the next season i wonder like yara greyjoy and balon seem to have the snow bits were dull as they to be honest have been all season theyve wasted mckenzie crook and the character of tormund whos far more amiable and entertaining in the book with some laugh out loud lines largely revolving around member size since the next episode is called mysa mother we know its going to be danycentric but might it not also include a ratherstonyhearted mother too since its all over the net that theyre currently casting the red viper looks like were getting the dorne subplot ill be very disappointed if we dont get euron greyjoy too "
