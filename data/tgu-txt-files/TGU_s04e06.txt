"1" "ThatManWalking" 2014-05-22 " im a fan of the series but s4 its been a bit slow moving so far in my opinion given that all reviews prestart of the season were unanimous saying that we would see more action from the starti guess it will be like s3 when all the really meaningful action was left to the last two episodes thats too bad if hbo sticks to this formula "

"15" "bagsofsmoke" 2014-05-19 " good sleuthing having read the books i can tell you one of your theories is correct "
"16" "Hol48" 2014-05-19 " i really should have amalgamated my responses anyway i think few people apart from cersei truly believe tyrion did it but either they need someone to take the fall tywin the tyrells or they just wont risk butting heads with tywin over it everybody else on tywins part i think a lot of it is about pragmatism the killer cannot be seen to get away with it so they have to punish someone but theres no way to prove what happened what little evidence they have implicates sansa but she has already absconded i think it has to be one of the below a he believes tyrion did itb he knows he has little prospect of uncovering the truth and tyrion is simply the most convenient scapegoatc he suspects the truth but needs the tyrells too much to go after them personally i wouldnt bet on a i dont think hes as blinded by his hatred as cersei even if he believes tyrion would plot against joffrey i cant see him honestly believing that he would planexecute it in this fashion  especially not by pouring the poison himself "
"17" "malevoisine" 2014-05-19 " agreed  and i also seem to remember it not being at all immediately obvious that theon was reek it took a few pages to dawn on me and then the horror sinks in theres a really tragic and terrifying note to the story in the books that the tv series hasnt managed to capture at all  perhaps inevitably given that when you see his face theres no denying who reeks original identity is  but still they could have done it differently "
"18" "malevoisine" 2014-05-19 " dont think the poster was referring to that comparison rather the comparison they themselves made with the whos "
"19" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-19 " duly noted but knowing what we do of tywin it just doesnt sit  with me anyway that he would not see beyond the facts as presented at the trial hes too shrewd "
"20" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-19 " dont think for a second tywin thinks tyrion is guilty but it suits several agendas that he appears to do so and is borderline incredible that he isnt also using all means at his disposal to finger the real culprit surely its too simplistic to say he doesnt care in my view "
"21" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-05-19 " i havent read the books so only have the show to go on to be fair ive read the books and i still cant say for sure whether or not tywin believes in tyrions guilt "
"22" "Hol48" 2014-05-19 " i havent read the books so only have the show to go on but what im unsure of is whether tywin doesnt suspect for the reasons you mention or if hes considered it but is just being pragmatic as hes so often pointed out the lannisters need the tyrells joffreys death has been a great boon to him and if he did suspect them i think he would grasp the fact that it was a move against joffrey not the lannisters even if he wouldnt think of margaerys happiness he might think of the threat his eldest grandson would pose to anyone who displeased him  especially as more than one wedding was on the cards not to mention the general financial and political problems posed by having such a sadistic brat in control which of course would directly affect them as the people propping up and financing the throne if hes seen all that i can well understand why he might hedge his bets and decide that on this occasion he had more to gain by turning a blind eye and just tightening control of the tyrells rather than actually moving against them he doesnt seem like a man motivated by simple revenge  even when he takes revenge its about strategic gainsdefence and shows of power rather than being at all bothered "
"23" "Hol48" 2014-05-19 " i wondered if hes just playing dumb because of his own familys involvement "
"24" "Hol48" 2014-05-19 " i wonder if thats due to the starks  obviously with it being their motto uttering it even as a factual comment might feel dangerous "
"25" "Hol48" 2014-05-19 " yes i thought it fairly obvious that she was squirming because she knows the truth "
"26" "oldsquareeyes" 2014-05-19 " youre right about littlefinger of course he had left already and yes he may think tyrion is guilty i wonder if mr tyrell is as stupid as he seems "
"27" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-05-19 " i doubt that tywin suspects the tyrells as to his mind killing joffrey wouldnt have been any benefit to them remember that tywin is unlikely to have even considered margerys happiness as part of a motive as for littlefinger as far as anyone knows he had left for the eyrie long before the wedding and no one knows that he had come back to pick up sansa well ser dontos knew but he isnt telling anyone tywin may be a thorough and intelligent man but any number of people may have wished joffrey dead and its simply not in his best interests to pursue the matter besides as far as hes concerned its quite possible that tyrion is guilty "
"28" "oldsquareeyes" 2014-05-19 " i agree that tywin has welcomed joffreys death bar cersei who hasnt and used it for his own ends but still you would have thought its bad news for the lannisters to have a king slayer out there that they dont know about tywin hasnt for instance suspected anything about the tyrells or old littlefinger despite the fact that latter split town at the same time as the murder and hasnt been seen in kings landing since "
"29" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-05-19 " tywin may actually believe that tyrion is guilty but in truth he just doesnt care prior to tyrions request of a trial by combat joffreys death had been working out quite well for tywin and now that matters are out of his hand tywin isnt the type to go looking for complications "
"30" "oldsquareeyes" 2014-05-19 " sorry if this question has already been asked but does the setting up of tyrion as joffreys killer mean that everyone actually believes he did it and if they dont but would like to use it as an excuse to get rid of him arent they a bit curious about who did kill joffrey it seems odd that someone as thorough as tywin lannister would go along with a sham trial without knowing the truth "

"37" "IzzyMoreno" 2014-05-18 " yawn of thrones what a boring series "
"38" "fozziebearish" 2014-05-18 " thats the thing with the lannisters theyre not as unilaterally psychotic as they are made out to be jofrrey being the notable exception we know now that it was littlefinger and lysa that killed jon arryan and ultimately engineered ned starks appointment to hand of the king and cersei was content for ned to go to the wall and not start a civil war  it was joffrey acting out of his own lunatic interests that prompted that likewise tywin knows that if he killed tyrion hed lose all leverage over jaime and his lineage would end tywin is all about the continuation of the family line above all  hence the marriage to the tyrell family and the heavy debt to the iron bank "

"88" "elleesse" 2014-05-14 " no varys didnt lie but he twisted the truth as you say presenting the words out of context but he understandably i think didnt come to tyrions aid i think any witness in that situation would see it was pointless to argue for him it wouldnt have done the least bit of good seeing as it was patently obvious that the outcome was already decided defending tyrion publicly would only have propelled varys into trouble and out of power away from his sphere of influence varys is very good at playing the game and a long game remember the wizard who castrated him in the crate and as he mentioned to oberon am i spelling that right feel like im missing a y in there somewhere anyway as varys mentioned to oberon he has no desires in kings landing to care for someone or something means to be vulnerable jaimes caring for tyrion and begging for mercy left him vulnerable to being doublecrossed by his dad into leaving the kings guard going to casterly rock and taking on a wife who will that be i wonder tyrion was vulnerable due to his relationship to shae and vice versa and on and on but varys how would one blackmail him apart from threatening to take his life he carefully weaves an air of having no vulnerabilities no loves no family no friends this means he has longevity in terms of influence in the court and can stay on and on without being murdered or cast out and therefore get on with helping the realm which he previously claimed was the one thing he did care for i also reckon the plea of you said you would remember me wont fall on deaf ears if varys has the realm and protection and care of it as his ultimate goal then i guess he meant he wouldnt forget what tyrion did at some unspecified point in the future that he would manoeuvre him into the right place at the right time in terms of using him towards the protection of the realm its not very much good for right now though "

"110" "Aelfwine" 2014-05-14 " i think some of the outrage at least was due to the fact that it was very out of a character for bookjaime not the nicest chap of course but still rather opposed to rape and didnt match the cerseijaime relationship in the books whereas all the abuse inflicted on theon is very much in keeping with what we know of ramsays characterisation and theons state "

"112" "elleesse" 2014-05-14 " well leaving aside that im not overly keen on the actress and her portrayal of shae she is in the hierarchical society that got portrays is down in the gutter compared to the rich powerful of family tyrion it would be supremely naive of her to assume that she could go from whore to wife considering the world they live in and she doesnt seem like a stupid character i get that she didnt want to leave him i dont get that she thinks she knows better than tyrion about the evil machinations of the court therefore expecting him to commit to her after an arranged marriage to a highborn lady is asking too much of him love vs duty he did love her but he dutifully married at the will of his father and subsequently did his best to protect shae at least thats how i see it remember what joffrey did to ross and so much for his lovely young wife he didnt even consummate the marriage and shae knew that explicitly "

"134" "Dewulf" 2014-05-14 " yeah as you say i think its a combination of both  if youve got a sure thing you could nominate them or at least look their way whilst asking for aidif not you may have to simply appeal to anyone present as he did at the eerie of course the combatant can always refusebut if its versus the mountain i think tyrion will be pretty sure of oberyn agreeing "

"246" "Barninho" 2014-05-13 " its actually up to the combatant rather than the person on trial isnt it when he was in the eerie tyrion nominated jaime because he knew for a fact hed stand for him with jaime not having much confidence in his abilities i doubt hed feel confident he could save his brother hes probably more likely to try and find him another badass a bit of shame he let brienne piss off on a big hike shed have been handy "
"247" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-13 " there is some mention in the book that what tywin hates more than anything is being laughed at his father made their family a laughing stock and he felt humiliated and he seems to think of tyrion as humiliating too like the dwarves at the wedding "
"248" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-13 " no i find it distracting too though when it is mostly in the background like this episode i dont notice it much the stuff in the brothel previous weeks annoyed me it seemed pointlessly taking up time that could be better used elsewhere "

"251" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-13 " margery is actually a lot like tyrion she plays the game but has a sense of justice and empathy she also was i think a bit naive she was shocked i think when her grandmother told her what she had done and she is very uncomfortable with the consequences tyrion had a similar learning curve with being hand they would probably make a really good powercouple "
"252" "OllyWinkles" 2014-05-13 " he had already been bought off by a lordship in the series by the time he was sparring with jaime but i agree that this is the real reason bronn is absent now  he has it made and while hes genuinely fond of tyrion he no longer has any financial incentive to stick his neck out for him "
"253" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-13 " im not sure it is that simple it is my strong impression that tywin thinks that somehow the trial is going to actually come to the truth about the murder of joffery given what he knows about what cercei is doing how could he think that and whatever his views about tyrion does he really think that he killed joffery even jaime can see how unlikely that is it seems to me he is holding two contradictory views  that tyrion is guilty and the trial will be fair and that tyrion didnt actually kill joffery at all is he just justifying things to himself maybe but what i wonder is if it is an instance of an odd sort of blindness to things that he doesnt want to know like his seeming blindness to significance of the dragons  both militarily and in relation to all the reports of magic he dismisses so readily it seems very similar in some ways to the way cercei tells herself the stories she wants to believe are true and actually believes them even as she creates them "
"254" "JRF314159" 2014-05-13 " i am wondering just how varys thinks he can get on the throne hes not a lord even ultimately dont you have to be descended from a royal line to ascend the throne "

"257" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-13 " for sansa as long as her parents were around there was no need to make her the responsibility of the lannisters which is what would have happened if shed been married  her father would have lot much of his authority which wouldnt have appealed especially when he didnt trust the lannisters and once ned was killed it was probably advantageous to the lannisters to put off the wedding a bit  there wasnt much advantage to them any more they were quick enough to marry her off as soon as they thought there might be issues keeping her where they wanted her "
"258" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-13 " she could have been but they didnt choose to do so at 12 when she did marry she was still under age she was betrothed which has a legal force and was good enough to create an alliance there was no good reason to marry her off until she could consummate the marriage and potentially bear children  when the marry people off at a younger age it is and was historically only when there was some need for a solid legal connection so a king might marry at a young age to seal a political alliance or a child who was orphaned without family might be married in order to make sure his or her affairs were administrated and there was a guardian girls werent always married off as soon as they were fertile either  many waited a bit longer until a good prospect came along or their parents preferred to give them a bit more time "

"263" "dsk84" 2014-05-13 " yep tywins sister said that to him pissing off both tywin and jaime but it was an astute observation another reason he seems to hate him is the rumours that his wife was raped by the mad king and thus tyrion could have been a bastard rather than his own and of course that his birth lead to his wifes death cersei hates him for the same reason the way she would torture him as a child was pretty sad but amusing too i think oberyn recalls it in the books but i wont go into it in case it comes up later though i doubt it will "

"267" "MRONeill" 2014-05-13 " absolutely i think tywins biggest issue with tyrionwhich i believe has been stated in this seriesis that its tyrion that is truly tywins son  not jaime its tyrion that is fiercely intelligent can be trusted to be hand of the king in tywins stead understands the game as well as better than tywin just like how cersei cant stand jaime anymore who she loved possibly for no other reason than he was her with a penis due his his deformity  tywin cant stand that his mirror image is a dwarf that killed his mother "

"269" "MsEnvelop" 2014-05-13 " i have some objections to your comments i think you are too harsh on shae perhaps she is not be an angel the way you describe it but she deserves more respect in my view she is just a woman who loves a man and expects to be loved in the same way she went to kl because she wanted to be with him and stayed there because she loved him at the battle of bw she did not run away even did not go with sansa because she just wanted to see tyrion one last time and as you may remember she was carrying a knife she was ready to kill someone to protect herself and also tyrion presumably she remained a loyal friend to sansa when sansa told her about her planned marriage with loras she did not even tell this to tyrion this requires lots of integrity and a strong sense of loyalty thats true she paid visits to tyrion in his chambers although warned against it but one of the few occasions she did it she did so for sansa after the scene with lf again after the battle of bl she could have just left tyrion obviously did not have the same power was wounded could not protect her why did she stay if not for her love for tyrion she did so because she wanted to and because she loved him remember she is his and he is hers tyrions marriage to sansa was harsh for her because she really loved tyrion and was afraid of losing him this is a very human feeling i would feel jealous and grow insecure too in her situation because then it occurred to her that although low class and a prostitute she could love and being loved but for being together with someone like tyrion you need also other things nobility a name etc etc she was depressed and felt insecure and threatened many of us would feel the same way it seems she was bullied into betraying tyrion but then i would like to see more evidence to clarify this for instance a few bruises on her body or some scares on her face i would like to see her voice whispering when she accused him to make this believable for me the way they did it shows that they in a second ignored all the difficult and complex feelings shae has been through as a vulnerable yet loving and caring woman and let me tell you why 1 they do not care so much for female characters 2 they want to get eventually back to the story in the books i do not want to spoil anything here but as far as i know she has one last big part to play at some point this season  got is a wonderful show and the producers and writers are very intelligent people but in some instances they do such things which make so sense it is not shae who is short term oriented but the creators of the show it was easier and more convenient for them to develop the relationship between tyrion and shae as this and build tryion as a hero in our eyes and now they are preparing us for something else something for more dramatic therefore shae has to be vilified lets see what will happen with bronn "

"288" "Simgeo" 2014-05-13 " i loved the stareout between tyrion and tywin at the end as much as cersei is blinded by her pathological need to see tyrion as viciously evil tywin is just as blinded by his own need to see tyrion as a worthless drunken waster who should have been left out on a hillside to die he can play most people and keep his cool but tyrion is forever catching him off guard by refusing to follow his script at some point tywin must be thinking well he did hold the city during the siege escape from the vale not only with his life but an army of vicious clansmen and one of the best swordfighters in the seven kingdoms maybe he does have something about himnah it must all be a fluke i mean hes a dwarf only tall people are good for anything "

"293" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-05-13 " the trial was a farce and varys knew he couldnt save tyrion by testifying honestly on his behalf all that would do would put himself in danger of reprisal it was interesting that jaime played the honest broker and fell directly in tywins trap but tywin didnt count on the spitefulness of cersei provoking a situation from which there could be no return it was a neat echo of cersei being helpless to stop joffrey taking ned starks head after a fragile peace had been agreed between the starks and lannisters while joffrey started a war for his own selfishness cersei has single handedly destroyed her own family for revenge he always was his mothers son "
"294" "Jez Holland" 2014-05-13 " so what did you think can tyrion play the trial by combat card twice what is prince oberyn really up to and is mace tyrell as big a fool as he seems most importantly what is stannis going to do with his newly minted braavosi gold – head for king’s landing or stick to the original plan and sail north i think this has been the best episode this season he has played thretrial by combat card again so yes i think we all want him to be successful in its use though but when has game of thrones given you the outcome you want prince oberyn going by this episode and his wine talk is playing marwood to tyrions withnail who has mistakenly demanded combat instead of booze if you were to look up the word buffoon in the dictionary you would find a picture of mace tyrell although it would be a westorosi dictionary and therefore kept by old men with skinny arms or hacked to pieces by an inbreb ingrate king with major daddy issues and a drink problem as for stannis i would like to see him and davos go on a tour of the essos vineyards but realistically he is likely to go north because you know he said he would and he really isnt the type of person to change his mind on a whim "

"306" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-05-13 " or just get your man servant to do it "
"307" "malevoisine" 2014-05-13 " indeed plus lets not forget that after his candid revelation to cersei about the state of the lannister coffers he knows they need the tyrells onside so can hardly accuse them of involvement in his grandsons murder if the time should come when they are surplus to requirements though i wouldnt be surprised to see him dispense with them just as well for them that cersei isnt running the show as she hates them almost as much as her brother "
"308" "SomeRandomPerson" 2014-05-13 " free tyrion i hope dinklage hasnt got any parts of the scenery stuck between his teeth from that bite he took out of it "
"309" "James Minglis" 2014-05-13 " a it was established with the last scene and the shaving scene earlier b yeah and then she runs away cos of some doggies thats the whole point the scene is not only pointless but rushed and sillyc its got so we dont need it to be there just for the sake of it go watch spartacus d it doesnt it just doesnt have to be fucking pointless  like that scene got aint perfect and that scene was one of its low points "
"310" "malevoisine" 2014-05-13 " at least we book readers know who everyone is mostly although the last two novels took so long to come out that upon picking each of them up the first thing i did was flick to the 20 pages or so of family trees at the end "

"314" "bleudegex" 2014-05-13 " my guess is that tywin suspectsknows the tyrells were behind joffreys death but isnt that bothered it wasnt an attempt to usurp the throne or remove the lannisters from power it was just a way to get rid of joffrey because he was an evil bastard and a crap king it suits both parties "
"315" "Janel Jones" 2014-05-13 " why in fact does tywin have it in for tyrion surely not a prejudice against the disabled "
"316" "WelshPaul" 2014-05-13 " it has been mentioned that in the history of westeros the targaeryns rode their dragons into battle rather than let them fly alone and that no rider would be permitted to ride anothers dragon "
"317" "bleudegex" 2014-05-13 " i dont think margaerys quite the political player you think she is she looked genuinely shocked when he grandmother told her she murdered joffrey and i think shes genuinely upset that tyrion and sansa are paying for something they didnt do i know shes been trying to go toe to toe with cersei but shes nowhere near that level of coldhearted evil yet "

"319" "Bluedylan" 2014-05-13 " conversely maybe theres a level of surprise to her reaction about just how ruthless this family that shes marrying into is also shes not quite the political schemer in the show as im led to believe she was in the books she was shocked by the queen of thorns admission of guilt rather than being complicit in it "
"320" "Bluedylan" 2014-05-13 " ok no real need for the unnecessary sarcasm but isnt that incredibly remiss of littlefinger the brilliant mastermind "
"321" "bluemersey" 2014-05-13 " yeah i think shae undid if for him he expected tyrion to take the knights watch option and he probably would have done were it not for his emotional reaction to the shae betrayalcoercion "
"322" "EmilLyng" 2014-05-13 " fantastic episode though the theon rescue scene was very reminiscent of monty python and the holy grail run away run away "
"323" "bluemersey" 2014-05-13 " i dont think theyd just have bronn killed off screen like that though theres way too much audience investment in him not to use it dramatically i hope surely he can only die while giving us one last ironic quip anyway as for shae tywin may have orchestrated it but i think he underestimated the effect it would have on tyrion one step too far "

"326" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-05-13 " totally  in your face moment thats always been tywins problem with tyrion he could never really control him like the other two shae the final straw shows tyrions own vulnerability at not being loved by anyone else but his brother and possibly pod "

"330" "Owlyross" 2014-05-13 " hopefully this isnt a spoiler but by this point in the books bronn has been bought off with a lordship so its into the unknown how his character will play out in the series "

"332" "LoneWilf" 2014-05-13 " tywin looked totally taken aback when tyrion requested a trial by combat i cant believe the archmanipulator never anticipated that "
"333" "bagsofsmoke" 2014-05-13 " yes that was my impression i cant remember that bit in the books but it certainly seemed like jaime made a whole load of concessions that were in effect unnecessary  tywin always planned to send tyrion to the wall and having his other son volunteer to rescind his position as a kingsguard just ticked another box he would have addressed subsequently "
"334" "bagsofsmoke" 2014-05-13 " the writers have said this season will be different having read the books the next episode will be an absolute belter "
"335" "Luke18" 2014-05-13 " i dont think tyrion cares i dont think this is a game i think he wants to go out with two fingers up to his father and without indulging in the farce of a trial and if he believes in the gods knows that they will prove his innocence "
"336" "pavanne" 2014-05-13 " also in the books he repeatedly insists that hes paying her to act as if she loves him so she does she may simply be a very good actress as far as the reader can tell doing exactly what shes being paid for in the tv series this angle has not been emphasised so the line isnt quite so clear on the other hand tyrion still knows shes not his lover of her own uncompensated inclination "
"337" "LordMeowingtons" 2014-05-13 " when she is "
"338" "LordMeowingtons" 2014-05-13 " really good episode even if there wasnt really much action as such loved it this might have something to do with the fact we didnt see sansa either oooh i went thereit was all about the little looks and facial expressions from tyrion though from the little sad face when he shes shae walking up behind him to his outburst about joffrey and then the final stare to tywin  tywin thinking you little bastard very well donecant wait to see it all unfolding i know what happenskind of got to give a mention to oberyn and varys too the actors playing them have done a great job wish i had oberyns accent ha i could watch them all day shame there was no hound in this episode but i guess we have to give them a rest for a while i mean they must be knackered with all that walking around aimlessly by now "
"339" "Rich1991" 2014-05-13 " i think i can guess the title of the next episode has some hints "
"340" "Owlyross" 2014-05-13 " i actually cant comment on anything in this episode for fear of spoiling something suffice to say that was one of the best episodes so far with the exception of yaras story everything was vital to the ongoing story and even that showed how broken reek is so was probably necessary just simply brilliant "
"341" "bellagrrl" 2014-05-13 " all the more reason for tyrion to choose jaime "
"342" "bjammin187" 2014-05-13 " foreplay "
"343" "Dewulf" 2014-05-13 " hmm but its not a case of if youve got a mate whos good with a sword not for most people anyway tyrion because of his size is probably the only one or perhaps a women as well who could ask for a champion to represent himand the last time that happened in the eyrie it was almost suggested by the knight who ended up getting killed by bronn plus you might be handy with a sword but even if you are the prosecution are free to call the most badass warrior in the army on hand so unless youre top 5 in the entire continent theres every chance youll be fighting someone significantly better than you therefore you may just wish to argue your case and hope for a favourable verdict "
"344" "westmike" 2014-05-13 " now my thoughts such as they are is that now that we have so many plots and characters in play that they could do with an extra episode or 2 against  and this would be the main one i suppose  the seasons thus far have a similar cadence which builds to a big crescendo  pay offresolution of the seasons main conflict in the 9th episode with the next season set up in the 10 episode that is how the 1st 3 have been written and structured and its been brilliant this season already has a different structure weve had a cathartic killing of one of the main antagonists in ep 2 the trial in ep 6 and presumably the trial by combat next week in ep 7 to be followed by at a guess the wildling attack on the wall in ep 9 followed by a tying of some loose ends and primers for season 5 in ep 10 given the change in pacing in this series moving to a 12 episode structure might not be that jarring would allow more space for storylines and characters to develop without the need to drop in on every plot point every week for 5mins here and there without really moving any of them on the other point of comparison other shows with similarly complex albeit very different themes and plots running scross multiple character arcs and story lines like the wire tended to have 1213 episodes a season without any dilution in the quality of the storytelling writing or pacing basically i just want more can we have more please "
"345" "Kevtb1987" 2014-05-13 " as someone who just recently caught up with the books and passed the tv show i cant wait to see the upcoming lannister storyline play out on screen i look forward to the reactions "
"346" "Janel Jones" 2014-05-13 " he probably has a very good idea but doesnt care since it saved him the trouble of dealing with joffrey and gives him the chance to be rid of the tyrion problem better for him to know it was the tyrells and they not to know he knows "
"347" "Kevtb1987" 2014-05-13 " just because youre in the minority doesnt make you wrong keep fighting the good fight let your voice be heard youre wrong by the way it was a fantastic episode doing what this show does best making great dramatic use of all the well fleshed out characters and relationships and turning the screws to breaking point scenes like the trail at the end is the kind of drama every writer in the world hopes to achieve but getting to that point requires an awful lot of time effort skill and patience and being got you know for sure that whats occurring will have unpredictable and long lasting consequences if you cant enjoy it i pity you "
"348" "londonhongkong" 2014-05-13 " i guess tyrion would have naturally been the winner of the got given his smarts cunning ruthlessness  bravery when needed and and yet also wisdom  compassion but some of these stem from his dwarfism which seems to prevent him from winning because of how others perceive him or deal with him yet if he wasnt a dwarf would have had these necessary qualities to win i guess part of his tragedy "
"349" "PatriciaPJ" 2014-05-13 " my mouth was mostly open during this terrific episode oh tyrion i cannot express how passionately i want that bitch cersei to get her comeuppance i dont even feel sorry for her losing her precious psycho son  and thats saying something believe me so much emotion this week and so brilliantly played "
"350" "Noodlescheyenne" 2014-05-13 " margaery didn’t look very happy at tyrion’s trial – i wasn’t sure whether it was simply that she thinks her father is a fool who shouldn’t open his mouth or whether she has her doubts about the whole process correct me if i am wrong but isnt this because she knows that tyrion had nothing to do with it all considering her confessional grandmother from last week "
"351" "londonhongkong" 2014-05-13 " the idea is to show that these dragons which are merely adolescent at oldest are already pretty damned terrifying and to compare to say aegons balerion the black dread who could swallow a mammoth whole hence why everyone in westeros shits themselves at the thought of facing danys dragons when fully grown basically you dont stand a chance "
"352" "GhostWiper" 2014-05-13 " i might have missed something obvious but why was ramsey already covered in blood when he arrived to fight theons sister "
"353" "Kevtb1987" 2014-05-13 " so your son is obviously going to be named tyrion right "
"354" "Kevtb1987" 2014-05-13 " theon is one of the most fascinating characters for me yes hes done terrible things but at the back of it all we the audience can see where hes come from torn between his blood greyjoy and the family who raised him stark hes in a no win situation he has to betray one to side with the other i think thats why we are so uncomfortable with his torture and present state because while hes no angel in westeros who is i dont think hes a bad person just confused split and desperate for acceptance "
"355" "RasLob" 2014-05-13 " she actually says im going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet im going to choose the fifty best killers on the iron islands im going to sail up the narrow sea all the way to the weeping water im going to march on the dreadfort im going to find my little brother and im going to bring him home so yes she goes all the way around the continent "
"356" "TonyMcCabe" 2014-05-13 " ramsay needs a taste of valyrian steel and quick what a complete bastard "
"357" "whatorly" 2014-05-13 " maybe tywin knows who killed joff and doesnt care cos of their loot "
"358" "roganis" 2014-05-13 " the trial by combat is a bit stupid it basically means that if your mate is handy with a sword you have a free pass through the westeros judicial system updated  this trial by jury is a bit stupid it basically means that if your expensive lawyer is handy with obscure and dubious legal technicalities you have a free pass through the western hemisphere judicial system "
"359" "Dewulf" 2014-05-13 " ok a lot of folks have had a problem with yaras quest so im gonna try and refute that if i cana having reek actually refuse to go with his sister shows just how badly ramsay has broken himb weve heard yaras a badass in battle now weve seen it believed itc come on its got i love the court scene but we all need a bit of stabbystabby in an episode and dragonsbut we know dragons are exxyd and this is my main point  if every fing scene was ballstothewall thrilling omgidontbelievethatamazingplotdevelopment good then pretty soon all those amazing scenes wouldnt excite us that much at all you need some parts to just be so that other parts can shine "
"360" "tomaszzaraza" 2014-05-13 " thing is i cant figure out the one fully in armour "
"361" "fenixx" 2014-05-13 " yara thought nothing of going up against a whole castle of armed soldiers id have thought she fancied her chances against dogs shes armed she has armour shed have killed them fairly easily she only ran away from there as her mission was lost to the greyjoys  there is no theon to recover i wonder how ramsey will resurrect theon though  yara has seen him as he is  who can he fool  "
"362" "TessaInWonderland" 2014-05-13 " i am constantly having my moral compass compromised with my increasing love for jaime lannister the pusher of small boys and a rapist "
"363" "TessaInWonderland" 2014-05-13 " this episode was traumatic poor old tyrion cant trust anyone these days "
"364" "Moreisless" 2014-05-13 " they obviously know dany but everyone else should be regarded as a large snack i guess this is always the problem with the fantasy genre in that the amount of intelligence possessed by a dragon is always going to be highly debatable "
"365" "jdhathrisen" 2014-05-13 " the show has upped the ages of plenty of people in the books dany is 1314 tommen is 89 missandei is a child jon snow is 16 iirc "
"366" "EdwardMonton" 2014-05-13 " is it not possible that littlefinger is again behind thisplaying the long game  poison joffrey steal sansa away marry king of the norths sisterinlaw arrange for tyrion to die by supplying a damning witness kill his new missus and then marry sansa "
"367" "Dewulf" 2014-05-13 " just wanted to say spot on with your assessment of shae well i have nothing against the actorhey if were meant to be a bit critical of the character then id say shes doing a good job because i totally buy her betrayal of tyrion on the standits a selfcentred person who tyrion had to hurt in order to get her to safety but all shes never been able to look past getting her shortterm needs met and throwing a hissyfit if that didnt happen "
"368" "eyedropper" 2014-05-13 " good point theres probably better qualified people than i to answer that are they as intelligent as a dog or more like a person "
"369" "GramGram" 2014-05-13 " there are so many great characters and actors in got that an hour always seems insufficient this was the first time in a while that tyrian had an opportunity to let out his true feelings and it was awesome powerful television in over half a season there hasnt been quite enough arya  hound activity for me or progression or briene or littlefinger or jon snow basically we need more "
"370" "insightandtruth" 2014-05-13 " well you know what they say bout dem lannisters "
"371" "Dewulf" 2014-05-13 " a actually jaime was holding his own against bronn no mean feat the last time we saw them barring the very bronnstyle goldhand trickery at the end b tyrion therefore might want to choose jaime but in this situation id say its obvious this will be deemed inappropriate  jaime in kings landing is responsible for the kings safety not risking his own life in a dispute in which officially he should be impartialc not confirmed but very likely bronn had something to do with shae ending up in the stand even if it was only the lannisters making it clear that he would lie for them or die as pod said hes under investigation too which means theyre leaning on him and as such wont be free to fight for tyrion plus at the end of the day bronns a realist and a sellswordhe sells his swordd once youve ruled out jaime and bronn there are two much more likely combatants already mentioned here and in the show apparently in the trailers i never watch trailerstoo many spoilers lolhave a think about it  "
"372" "tronald" 2014-05-13 " i had a very different image of him but i got it from listening to the audiobooks  roy dottrices voices are fantastic but miles away from the tv show "
"373" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-13 " shae was also orchestrated by tywin surely he identified her just prior to the purple wedding i think and requested she be apprehended i suspect this played out and she was coerced into that testimony on the bronn issue did he sell out tyrion  yes he is conspicuous by his absence at the trial maybe he was for once loyal and not for sale and has paid the ultimate price for getting in the way of tywin "
"374" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-13 " oh good point what price the wealth of the tyrells then "
"375" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-13 " yes bothspot  on "
"376" "bjammin187" 2014-05-13 " naught dany looking secretly pleased at her dragons goat roasting ways "
"377" "Dewulf" 2014-05-13 " yep  as others have said look at what he said to jaime hell be punished accordingly  he knew tyrion was not going to be executed plus i reckon he knows tyrion wouldnt be reckless or stupid enough to poison joffrey or stand there holding the cup for that matter but hes always been angry at tyrions inclination to go drinking and whoring rather than play the game of family survival plus the whole dwarf thing right so this provided tywin with a perfect solution deprival of tyrions two main loves by having to take the black is probably something tywin is more than a little happy to execute and perhaps this is part of why tyrion decided to say f it trial by combat "
"378" "VonSparron" 2014-05-13 " from the speed with which he accepted jaimes proposal and the smirk on his face afterwards i get the impression that was tywins real agenda all along he knows that the trial is a farce and that tyrion is innocent but he also knew that jaimes love for his brother meant he would do anything to save him shae was the wildcard that blew everything out of the water "
"379" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-13 " so that said do you definitely know it was jamies sword "
"380" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-13 " yup wot sarah said "
"381" "whatorly" 2014-05-13 " maybe shes thinking  if they will do this to their own brother what will they do to me especially cersei "
"382" "Moreisless" 2014-05-13 " in last nights episode the dragon ignored the boy and bbqed the goat do they not attack humans also on tywins point that dragons not winning a war for 300 years do dragons require riders to differentiate between the 2 armies fighting each other  "
"383" "Uzume" 2014-05-13 " tyrion had better be there to the end of this  i havent read the books as i didnt want to know the story in advance and dont particularly like the style in which martin writes however i love the show and tyrion is the perfect combination of wit intellect and humour the show would be severely lacking without him dinklages performance was fantastic showing that whatever tyrion may feel he lacks in physical stature he makes up for in righteousness i agree with the comments about ramsay and reek i wish this would end i am most curious however about what will happen with the dragons now they are maturing and becoming harder to handle i think their mother may be in for a very difficult time and have to face the reality regarding her lack of power where they are concerned "
"384" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-13 " oh how i agree with you thank you for making me laugh "
"385" "whatorly" 2014-05-13 " 1 agree a little about ramsay bolton hes a bit of a cardboard cut out baddie 2 i think its called hedge funding  betting against both sides  the lannisters as revealed last week are no longer stinking rich hence the need to hold onto the iron throne  but if tywin dies what then stannis looks like a reasonable bet in the ensuing chaos 3 one has to presume she was threatened nastily and promised that tyrion would be pardoned sent to the wall "
"386" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-13 " i think her character has been soften a bit this season actually  when we first met her i thought she was much harder than seems to be the case "
"387" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-05-13 " did anyone else find it odd that tywin doesnt seem to notice that jaime isnt carrying his valyrian steel sword as a parent i can confirm that you soon become resigned to the careless indifference with which your children treat gifts from you "
"388" "NZerDan" 2014-05-13 " ha good luck and all the best to you mroneill quite an experience for us all through labour wife was saying missing got for this he would not wait "
"389" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-13 " for me too largely because he genuinely cares about tyrion whereas his feelings for cersei are somewhat more complicated yes yes i know thats understating it "
"390" "Moreisless" 2014-05-13 " on your 2nd point bankers always fund both parties in a conflict its the only way they are guaranteed to get their money back regardless of the outcomewith regards to shae hers actions are motivated by irrational jealousy "
"391" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-05-13 " but did lf throw the necklace over the side and into the boat yes "
"392" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-13 " yes but my point which i admit ive totally failed to make clear is that it surprised me that margaery cared about that shes been shown to be a pretty adept political player a show trial for tyrion works in her favour and keeps the heat of the tyrells so i was interested that she showed signs of having a conscience "
"393" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-13 " no i think it was  tywin melted down neds sword to create two valerian steel swords as mentioned in episode one one is given to jaime and the other is his wedding present to joffrey "
"394" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-13 " i think this is a spot on summary i would add tywin is a great strategist and a great opportunist he may not have anticipated joffreys death but once it happened hes moved swiftly to ensure events play out in his favour as you say getting rid of a problem son while getting his recalcitrant eldest to back down "
"395" "DarksidePaul" 2014-05-13 " by far the best moment was at the small council meeting and everyone got up when tywin entered except martel he reminded me of judd nelson in the breakfast club and the look he gave mace tyrell when he prattled off like a puppy to get tywin his parchment was priceless "
"396" "Owlyross" 2014-05-13 " one last point the petitioners at danys court thats straight out of the movie lincoln not the dragons part of course but the long lines of petitioners yeah it would be were it not in the books written years before lincoln came out "
"397" "raycoz" 2014-05-13 " just an observation but if the bowld snow arrives in kings landing wont that mean the wall has fallen and he has a the now undead population of the north not too far behind "
"398" "redmal" 2014-05-13 " really enjoyed this weeks episode especially tirions trial but there were some problems that i had with certain scenarios and characters1 i dont really like ramsey bolton hes a very one dimensional bad guy the dick darstardly of got just not as funny i dont think he would have been wiseto go into battle bear chested he has little battle experience or training and would have been swiftly dealt with by the iron born who were supposed to be the best hand picked warriors strangulation sex must really make you hard2 i didnt see the point in the iron bank funding stanis war it seems to me that any continuation of the war would weaken the iron thrones ability to pay back the debt with no guarantee that stanis will be successful this would increase the likelihood of an even larger default i dont think showing a few cut off fingers would convince a set of hard nosed bankers to take such a risk3 ive always had a problem with the character of shea her constant gurning idiotic demands and sensitivities seemed unrealistic in a worldly wise whore  i much preferred the book shea who was what she was with him for the money would the shea of last season come back to testify against tirion and her beloved sansa even if she felt scorned or forced glad to see varys back toowho needs a cock "
"399" "DarksidePaul" 2014-05-13 " why are people so interested in award ceremonies for art i think tv shows like gots and true detective should be categorized as art and putting those shows in competition against each other is so stupid as a tv script writer myself one who has won an award i found it boring and disrespectful to all my so called competitors if id wanted prizes i would have become a footballer but i guess actors are a different breed i think dinklage knows how good he is hopefully the director tells him so when they rap "
"400" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-13 " but did lf throw the necklace over the side and into the boat thought he crushed the fake stone on the rail of the ship to reveal how it was done but cant remember it going overboard into ser dontals floating hearse so the op asks a fair question "

"404" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-05-13 " does tywin really think that tyrion killed joffrey i know that he is supposed to despise his younger son and that he is using tyrions trial to exert control over jaime but surely someone as savvy as tywin would know that tyrion is not guilty and that the trial is a sham speaking exclusively about the tv series so no spoilers no i dont think he does think tyrion killed joffrey i think cersei does because she is blinded by hatred of him but tywin is seizing on an opportunity and i think his plan all along was revealed last night sending tyrion to the wall on trumped up charges rids him of tyrion without having to kill his own son the speed with which he agreed to jaimes request to spare tyrions life in return for him resigning from the kings guard also suggests he was anticipating something like that happening i think the tv show has also just left open the possibility though i dont personally believe it to be the case that tywin was complicit with olenna tyrell in murdering joffrey so that he could put the far more stable and amenable tommen on the throne "
"405" "HoggyBear" 2014-05-13 " similarly if the killer is widely perceived to be tyrion and tywin punishes his flesh and blood either by execution or letting him take the black then it makes the lannisters seem less vulnerable than if nobody knows who killed the king would definitely agree with this interpretation perhaps tywin believes it is better for the general populace to believe that joffreys death was simply the result of internal lannister feuding that to think that it was carried out by a rival power "
"406" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-13 " to be fair i am a show viewer who hasnt read all the books yet  but i do know the characters like that nice sandor baratheon and that little minx ayra lannister "
"407" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-13 " yeah i get that i suppose i just always felt margaery was too politically astute to care about fitting up an innocent man its more interesting if she does have a conscience im just surprised "
"408" "Dewulf" 2014-05-13 " oooookayim going to have to disagree with you there shae did show tyrion some compassion and love and so on especially after hearing about how his first marriage ended up and she does have some smarts instantly started helping sansa cover up after her first period but but but she has been dogged and blind in desire to carry on with tyrion as if theres no chance of getting caught and no dire consequences if that happens which to me says shes essentially selfcentered and needy to a fault  they only got caught because she was blowing her top at him whilst he was actually disobeying his father and not interested thatway in sansain fact shae shouldve known this from the weddingnight bed linenbut this is shaes nature  insecure prepared to take it out on the people closest to her and risk everything in the process then tyrion disses her to her face so that shell leave because if he says they found out youre in total danger shell just ignore him again because who cares about reality yeah and she takes all the insults he says to heart which is why up on the stand now shes not just saying the lies about sansa and tyrion conspiringshes also using their own personal moments as a way to hurt him in return for him hurting her in other words the same way she thought tyrion could turn away from her for sansa she believed what he said to her shes not that smart plus her world revolves more around a shortterm approach to meeting her needs and she gets angry when things out of tyrions control dont go her way so this is not out of character for her at all "

"410" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-05-13 " hes supposed to be marrying cersei in a few weeks perhaps hes considering asking for trial by combat as well "
"411" "keef1980" 2014-05-13 " just my interpretation of the series ive not read up to these events in the books yet but i think tywin and cercei have very different takes on the matter  i think cersei desperately wants to believe that tyrion is guilty and while she has tried to manipulate everyone into finding him guilty tywin hasnt been manipulated but has simply dispassionately looked at what is best for himthe familyfrom tywins point of view he knew what joffrey was and is not in the slightest bit upset that he is gone he also knows that allowing cersei to believe that tyrion is guilty works for him too hasnt he already used the situation to get her to consent to marrying lorassimilarly if the killer is widely perceived to be tyrion and tywin punishes his flesh and blood either by execution or letting him take the black then it makes the lannisters seem less vulnerable than if nobody knows who killed the king the only question i have about it is whether tywin is actually interested in who actually did it or if he simply thinks that someone was bound to it because of what joffrey was and so not look too hard i suspect that if he does find out who did it there will be a very private low key revenge rather than a show trial "
"412" "monders" 2014-05-13 " a dragon hasnt won a war for 300 years armies win them all the time margaery didn’t look very happy at tyrion’s trial – i wasn’t sure whether it was simply that she thinks her father is a fool who shouldn’t open his mouth or whether she has her doubts about the whole process its because she knows her gran was behind it "
"413" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-05-13 " i was a bit surprised at the manner in which he gave evidence it felt to me out of character and i was left a little disappointed in him on the contrary it was entirely in character on a number of occasions he has said things like how long do you think your father and sister would let me live if they suspected i was disloyal one of the most fascinating things about varys is how clearly he understands who he is he knows he has no real friends or allies in kings landing only people to whom he is useful enough to keep alive when tywin and cersei told him to testify to the threats tyrion made at the small council he would not have had a second thought because he knows that not doing so would be signing his own death warrant in his own way he is the most pragmatic character in the whole story "

"417" "HoggyBear" 2014-05-13 " one thing that id like to ask and yes ive read the books but cant remember if its explained any better in them either but does tywin really think that tyrion killed joffrey i know that he is supposed to despise his younger son and that he is using tyrions trial to exert control over jaime but surely someone as savvy as tywin would know that tyrion is not guilty and that the trial is a sham and if he does what is he doing to try and find out who did kill his grandson surely he would see them as a threat "

"427" "keef1980" 2014-05-13 " isnt the risk that the stakes are higher in trial by combat  as we saw even the rigged trial wasnt going to end in execution for tyrion so although hes put a spanner in the works he has raised the stakes significantly in a way that could be to his detriment in a way it was the last thing tywin expected  while the audience sees tyrion as being brave intelligent and with a strong sense of justice tywin sees him just as a cunning inconvenience on an added note for me jaime lannisters relationship with his brother is lovely "
"428" "Finkfloyd" 2014-05-13 " probably apt that hes playing tywin lannister thennice reference i agree about the acting though that moment of varys was great but for me charles dance effortlessly steals any scene hes in and any episode he plays a significant part in the subtle indication that hed planned it this way all along in the scene with jaime was a joy the lads playing ramsay and theonreek are fabulous too that is a pitchblack disturbing storyline that would be all too easy to overact but theyve pitched it beautifully the deranged glee in ramsays eyes when he was bathing reek was genuinely unsettling "

"484" "Carybdeida" 2014-05-13 " how did yara sail from the iron islands she had plenty of time to take any number of options considering she set out on that task at the end of last season but it is a good question in a number of other cases like 1 how did sir barristan find dany so quick and easily in asterpor after he was relieved of duty in kings landing 2 good to have confirmation that mormont is no longer spying on dany when was this reveled because i never did understand who the lanesters had as an inside mole tracking danys every move 3 how did catelyn stark run all over westeros from the inn at the cross roads to the eyrie and storms end and back up to the twins and theon greyjoy went from riverrun to the pike on the iron islands and then on a quick skirmish at winterfell before landing himself in the dreadfort all while rob was stuck running in circles between riverrun and the twins 4 but mostly what is hard for me to grasp is not how quickly some of these people are able to freely move about because i know its a movie but considering that this was expected to be the the last season which they spent 9 or 10 months filming how is it that on april 8th of this year less than a week before the first episode of this last season did they get renewed for two more seasons i mean we are talking some major last minute rewriting and filming of this season in less than two months how the hell did they move that fast at any rate im glad to hear my favorite series wont be ending and i want to say hats off to them for keeping the show going and doing whatever it took to make that possible "

"632" "MRONeill" 2014-05-12 " adored this episode  it was simultaneously very ungot like with the extended trial scene and of course got all the way with the wonderful plot momentum and paradoxes davos cutting his fun tale of past smuggling off with the look from stannis was priceless  and as sarah said the friendship between davos and salladhor is simply wonderful to watch getting a smile out of davos is almost as rare and precious as getting one out of jon snow it was poignant how the iron bank highlighted stannis poor odds based on the numbers  only a few thousand men only 32 ships yet no way to feed and sustain them when juxtaposed against danys situation  thousands upon thousands more people to feed  it hints to me of more problems to come for the mother of dragons speaking of said dragons  despite cerseis dismissive baby dragons  we saw that they are babies no more and that certainly wont be the last herd of rather cute goats theyll be eating presumably the appetite of three growing dragons is enormous  dany wont be able to buy off poor farmers forever i particularly liked danys scene as well  it was very emperor has no clothes or george w if you wish  showing the folly of crying freedom and victory without a plan for sustaining it i found myself somewhat surprisingly relishing in her discomfort and stubborn refusal that shed done anything wrong in crucifying the masters but perhaps only in the hopes that she will actually begin to learn some lessons while i liked last weeks episode i find it difficult to relish an entire hour 50min without peter dinklage as everyone seems to also feel he was masterful in this episode tyrions range from sarcasm resignation intelligent bemusement disbelief utter heartbreak and rightful fury was beyond a pleasure to witness thus far i venture to say tyrion is the only character with the possible inclusion of arya that the audience finds wholly justified in his actions this episode couldve been all trial and i would have been equally happy i dont want to end with a negative note but my strong dislike of shae actor and character isnt a secret i disagree with those who worry this is out of character for her  while i believe its debatable whether her feelings for tyrion were sincere it was always clear to me that she wasnt very intelligent or very kind she acted like a petulant child demanding a position in the castle manipulatively demanding his attention her behavior since tyrions marriage of sansa was either her being simply stupid because she mustveshouldve known that continuing to carry on their relationship would only put her in danger  or at this point i think more likely a sign of her feeling safe for other reasons because of promises of safetyriches by cersei or tywin i dont doubt that at least part of her testifyinglying was because she was pissed he tried to send her away but to me it was 100 in line with her character  acting out when she doesnt get her way varys varys varys  it could be that hes the most cunning person in all of westeros i hate that he testified damaging tyrion but varys understands the game as well as  if not better than  even littlefinger hes survived several kings and always seems to know how to phrase things so they could be seen to be valid from opposite perspectives while i have a hard time imagining his ambitions of upward mobility to be as great as littlefingers his glance at the iron throne ending his conversation with oberyn was intriguing indeed "

"636" "YoothaJoyce" 2014-05-12 " i actually thought i had passed out with the sheer joy of that episode  turns out mr roper had overdone the bromide in my gin again as he had taken inspiration from pycelles list of things not to slip in anyones drink at a key partyanyway ye gods that was superb sarah and the frankly brilliant comments have said it all so i cant add much but im still puzzling over shaes motivesreasonswhateverthehelltocallthem i cant help thinking that there has to be more to her appearance in the witness pulpit of lies than petty revenge on tyrion ive never completely enjoyed her presence i have to say  my liiiiiion etc blah blah but she never struck me as either stupid or disloyal to either tyrion or sansa so what is she actually up to what trade off has been offered or what has been planned behind the scenes of her sudden betrayal  is she being so cruel to tyrion in order for her to be ultimately kind is there a possible involvement of varys here again im thinking about the mahoosive amount of diamonds varys kindly offered her to save her own life and tyrions heart by sailing away with richesand ohh peter dinklage i love you so much "

"639" "HonestIago" 2014-05-12 " i think margaery doesnt want to see an innocent man die for a crime she knows he didnt commit its a fulltime job working out where characters motives truly lie but i believe margaery genuinely doesnt want innocents to suffer maybe her and varys should team up their motives seem to match each others it was a superb episode before the trial started and obviously the trial knocked it into a different league shae turning up was brutal what she said was even worse and tyrion reacted as youd expect someone to in that situation that those moments hurt so much says a im a bit of a wuss and b this is a show that has earned its emotional connections that in amongst the dragons and ice zombies there are characters with real heart and soul superb work by the writers throughout "

"650" "Annuska" 2014-05-12 " remember that varys had already tried to pay to send her away it was his own initiative and probably a genuine generous altruistic gesture and therefore not in character at all so of course she thinks its tyrion who has instructed varys to send her away she tells tyrion that he should tell her in her face that he wants her hone but tyrion doesnt know anything about varys trying to convince her to flee so he denies he wants her gone and being well aware of how things work in kings landing she doesnt believe him so from her point of view that last outbursts about her being just a whore just confirms what she had halffeared for a long time that he had been lying to her "
"651" "keef1980" 2014-05-12 " it is very unlikely but in a way it kind of works for me at least narratively  in a way his entire upbringing was based around renouncing his true identity and swearing loyalty to enemies  when he returned home and tried to win favour from his family he failed miserably and lost his moral compass in trying to do so he knows the starks wont have him back he knows his family dont actually want him his sister aside and its not like he can leave everything behind and fuck all the women he would like which is probably what his character would have done before so in a way hes now come full circle  hes having to swear loyalty to an enemy and hes embraced it wholeheartedly as it didnt work out so well for him leaving last time i wouldnt be surprised if he gets a moment where we see that hes actually still aware of himself but just doesnt have the will to do anything about his situation and maybe even sees it as what he deserves "

"662" "Mirthin" 2014-05-12 " i cant even express how much i hated yaras rescue the sequence made no sense at all it was like they had a whole story arch for the season that they completely forgot to include in the last 5 episodes so they stitched together a 4 minute montage from 30 minutes of film horrible someone needs to be fired for that travesty ruined an otherwise good episode "
"663" "Annuska" 2014-05-12 " i hope it is not a spoiler to say that us readers of the books are also wondering about osha and rickon welcome to the magical world of waiting on grrms times "
"664" "Mirthin" 2014-05-12 " yaras rescue was so weak that it ruined the otherwise good episode for me that whole sequence of events made no sense logically or dramatically and it was edited together with an axe if the writers are going to start improvising then at least do it right "

"667" "Thulcandra" 2014-05-12 " totally agree but for me nikolaj stole it this week the slow truth dawning on jaimes face as he realises nothing can save his brother was just heartbreaking and then to top it all off he makes his bargain with tywin and before the words are even out of his mouth the trap snaps around him just awesome work "
"668" "Annuska" 2014-05-12 " share isnt being forced when we last saw her tyrion made a point of rejecting her in the most brutal and painful manner so that she would stop loving him and get on that boat unfortunately he was convincing "

"674" "Midwinter" 2014-05-12 " the best and worst of thrones this evening i thought tyrions trial was expertly staged and escalated brilliantly dinklage really sold tyrions anger and frustration at the whole sorry pantomine when the show is able to spend the time to build these grand theatrical scenes it really pays off joffreys wedding earlier in the season was another good example on the other hand youve got yaras attempted rescue of theon which was over before it began and ended with an almost pythonesque retreat run away run away what a pointless diversion that and danys scene were the only bum notes though davos and stannis in braavos was a nice bit of comic relief and jaimes desperate efforts to save his brothers life added yet another layer to what is becoming the shows most complex character "

"677" "Catch22" 2014-05-12 " awesome it does seen on purely a logistical level that dany has the upper hand of course shes on the wrong blinking continent and has no as yet known allies in westeros but dragons and an army of eunuchs suck on that tywin "
"678" "NZerDan" 2014-05-12 " yikes what an episode just watched it after recording it tyrion demanding a trial by combat staring down his tywin was brilliant best moment of the series which was quite fitting my son was born about the same time that happened last night "

"682" "Catch22" 2014-05-12 " yeh theres a lot of big words spoken from characters who never actually walk the walk joffrey was chief amongst them stannis is becoming a bit like that toowhat is he actually going to do himself to get the iron throne back he has melissandre and her evil baby ghostdemon killing off rivals and then davos sorting out all his soldiersshipsfinancial backingwhat does stannis actually do other than lose battles and sacrifice innocent defenceless people and i thank you stannis is a big fat wasted space of entitlement say what you want about the lannisters evil bunch that they are but at least they flex some muscles and exercise the grey matter to gain and keep hold of power stannis is just a petulant toddler in comparison "

"686" "Catch22" 2014-05-12 " i know who the viper is or the red viper to give him his proper moniker its oberyn martell i had sort of figured this out about 5 minutes after the episode especially having watched the trailer and seeing him fight the mountain along with him wanting to kill the mountain to avenge his sister i just hoped people could have a good hearted speculative discussion about the ins and outs of different combat combinations "

"691" "keef1980" 2014-05-12 " if anything i think the comeuppance aspect is what makes it all the more creepy  at one stage i was really hoping for him to get his comeuppance but when it came i just wanted him to be either rescued or put out of his misery now i feel a bit ill when he appears the idea that hes going to role play as his old self makes my skin crawl "
"692" "keef1980" 2014-05-12 " tyrions confession was one of the best things i have ever ever seen on television i dont think ive ever actually properly hoped that a character survives but i really hope he does "

"698" "JoJo McJoJo" 2014-05-12 " the theon scenes are indeed the worst and most hearteviscerating but theres an element of narrative vengeance in it  remember that he murdered two innocent peasant kids just to improve his reputation that fact explains it but it does actually seem morally very cheap to give such a despicable character such comeuppance i cant decide whether shae was coerced into testifying against tyrion or if she is behaving realistically as a jilted lover  exwife often does "

"703" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-12 " well i thought of that but it seemed pretty consensual and i thought was taking place willingly with the girl we saw before the one who was keen on hunting with him hence why it stayed in that column "

"706" "DiamondDag" 2014-05-12 " the trial was brilliant i always know this show is at its best when a scene completely grips me even though i know the outcome peter dinklage on form i love how theyve used mace tyrell to inject some humour jaime trying to save his little brother loved every minute of that unfortunately the whole ramsaytheonyara thing was a farce i admit id already given up on that story line ever being good again but the sight of ramsay shirtless and grinning like an idiot left me shaking my head what a waste of interesting characters the story in braavos was great too actually mark gatiss was perfect "

"711" "sandyra" 2014-05-12 " i dont understand why ser davos has so much loyalty to such a cold fish as stannis the way hes portrayed he has no redeeming qualities that i can see hes hard inflexible and quite willing to be cruel not characteristics that would make me want to follow such a king ser davos is too good for stannis and stannis is too stupid to see how valuable davos is to him "

"783" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-05-12 " id completely forgotten about loras i was trying to think to myself who would be the two champions each side would choose i did have it down to 4 it could turn into the gregor clegane v oberyn fight weve been promised by tywin it could be jaime v bronn where one of those two is fighting to have tyrion executed and they are both on very good terms with tyrion jaime v oberyn that seems unlikely as then tywin would be risking losing either his son or the newly aquired allies of oberyn and house dorne or bronn v oberynmore likely maybe and a fairer fight would oberyn agree to that seeing as he seems to be quite an honourable chap and he clearly doesnt think tyrion is guilty now youve thrown loras into the mix and its hurting my brain "
"784" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-12 " if you look at the history of fantasy literature it very often tackles spiritual or metaphysical themes  especially the good stuff the conventions of the genre are really ideal for making those kind of internal realities external where we can see them as part of the story what are dragons except symbols of something wild and earthy and somehow a bit unnatural and what are those icezombies except something fundamentally evil and inhuman and at the same time a human creation in some sense the historyhuman driven aspect of the story seems to be very much connected to maybe anchored in this sort of spiritual world i think what we will find as the story goes on is that they mirror each other  the moral questions and different worldviews being played out by individuals are also at work in the fantastic and spiritual elements of the story if you look even at the title of the series i think it is indicative of that game of thrones is a secondary title  the series is a song of ice and fire its like the illiad which is also a song where the conflicts of gods and men are mirrored "

"790" "Lianna" 2014-05-12 " one thing that struck me about yaras storyline this week is that she was the only one that still cared about theon her men followed her because shes their leader they dont really know theon personally because he was fostered out they dont care about him maybe they care about the pride of the greyjoys and the ironborn out of all the ironborn all the greyjoys only yara and her relatively small group of men went to even try and save him her father could have easily given her more men that was sad to me a lone rallying cry to save a brother she had barely know for many years yet still she tried "

"812" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-12 " yes exactly but also i think even on the show he saved her and saw her as his love and then she took his private endearments and recast that love as stupid and worth mocking which again i think fed into the theme "

"836" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-12 " i think that is also true in a way though before she was as a character only really compelling in relation to tyrion  she was part of his story not interesting on her own by making her more interesting in her own right they both made tyrion more sympathetic or heroic as you say and avoided complaints that the female characters exist only to tell or support the story of the male characters in general it seems that any sympathetic character becomes more likable for tv and the evil ones like joffery become worse for whatever reason tv doesnt seem to do as well showing us heroes who are also pathetic as print does i tend to think that it is because we react more viscerally and emotionally to visual media "

"841" "otcdave" 2014-05-12 " varys didnt stick in the knife he recounted correctly what tyrion said in the small council meeting he was obviously forced by cersei to stand as prosecution witness and didnt look like he was revelling in doing so hence his answer to tyrions question  unfortunately i remember everything  it was his way of apologising to tyrion i think "
"842" "cybersuperhero" 2014-05-12 " na because if you use dragons to take a city there wont be much left of that city remember harrenhal that was scorched by dragons and its just a ruin now dany doesnt want to be queen of a pile of ash so she inspires a slave revolt instead "
"843" "Luke18" 2014-05-12 " i keep wrestling with it in my head as a non book reader i dont think they can kill tyrion he is really the emotional core of the entire kings landing plot and taking him away from it would make all of it so coldyetyet they couldi honestly cant tell you what will happen "
"844" "Pepa01" 2014-05-12 " i thought it was meant to make tyrion more likeable in the book he is so starving for affection that he ignores the obvious interest of shae money he was kind of pathetic but they changed this pathetism and made him a hero i dont think shae is lying for her life we have not see any regreat in her face nothing but anger and revenge i am a whore she said looking back at tyrion "

"846" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-05-12 " margaery didn’t look very happy at tyrion’s trial – i wasn’t sure whether it was simply that she thinks her father is a fool who shouldn’t open his mouth or whether she has her doubts about the whole process i thought the reason they kept showing a pensive margaery was because she actually knows who killed joffrey and therefore also knows that tyrion is innocent she could possibly save tyrion if she stood up and told everyonebut she would then implicate her own family and her own futurelife "

"884" "Muppet_N2" 2014-05-12 " i think its a lot simplier than varys likes tommen varys simply doesnt have a choice remember his dialogue with ned stark when you see me do you see a hero "
"885" "dsk84" 2014-05-12 " dont forget pod that boy doesnt have an ounce of evil in him "
"886" "swisschocolate" 2014-05-12 " this episode just reinforces my opinion from the purple wedding episode that the show is so much better when it sticks with only a few locations and focuses on long good scenes with many characters involved instead of that hectic jumping around between various locations for just a bit of banter or boobies "
"887" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-12 " i actually wondered if the change in her character throughout the series was an attempt to avoid accusations of misogyny by making her more likable and smart "
"888" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " excuse me while i whip this outand off "
"889" "swisschocolate" 2014-05-12 " wasnt she meant to have escapedgone away we dont know what has happened to her since someone might have leaned heavily on her to do what she did at the trial she was also very annoyedhurtangry that tyrion sent her away hell hath no fury "
"890" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-12 " i somewhat agree i wondered in past seasons how they would make her character work for this aspect of the story i think what they tried to do was make her seem a little emotional and the idea is the turnaround is an emotional reaction after that horrible last fight my problem was like you i didnt find her lack of belief in tyrions fear for her at all believable she was very streetsmart and knew what was going on around the castle she would have realized i think even if she thought tyrion ought to run off with her that staying in kings landing was dangerous for her mind you she seems to have been a person who was somehow damaged for love so perhaps it is meant to go back to that but in any case it did not totally hang together for me and i think it was the writing rather than the acting in the book shae is a rather stupid materialistic little twat and tyrion half sees it but only part of the time and he is really in love with her so it is completely believable as far as her motivations and more tragic for him because he really sowed the seeds of his own destruction there that was the story he told himself in what seems to be true lannister fashion "
"891" "PlumRadio" 2014-05-12 " do you think everyone looks up that gigantic statues kilt while sailing underneath it  a bit lotr no "
"892" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " i rather got the impression that tywin had always planned to send tyrion to the wall and jaime has bartered his birthright for a mess of pottage ah a biblical reference and youre right tywin would have never gone through with executing tyrion not because he loves the little whoremonger but for the sake of his own vanity as for giving him a fair trial tywin probably does believe it but the only reason tyrion even gets the privilege of a fair trial is because he has the right last name in westeros only the rich receive justice "
"893" "swisschocolate" 2014-05-12 " the younger tyrells might just be annoyed that their useless father uncle is a judge mace came out of nowhere while marge and loras have been around for ages "

"898" "Pepa01" 2014-05-12 " game of boobies mysogynistic nohow could you think such a thing o i agree the uturn does not make any sense it is not consistent with shaes character at all "
"899" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-12 " well it is better than certian conviction and a lot would depend on who you thought would fight on your behalf  or your own skills  and who for the other side in any case i am not sure tyrion entirely cares who wins he is doing it to upset his fathers plans "
"900" "Randomsausage" 2014-05-12 " to carry on from last weeks episodebastard bolton has killed more men than cecile b demille "
"901" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-12 " true and we do need to see their growth  increasing threat but the when to show them could be better surely especially when we know they are very budget heavy danny storms massive and hitherto impregnable city where youd think they might come in handy dragon count  zilch or we join two apparently lost shepherds watching the world go by  dragon count  one "
"902" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-12 " i rather got the impression that tywin had always planned to send tyrion to the wall and jaime has bartered his birthright for a mess of pottage and i think he realized it as well  his expression was a bit odd after that exchange i am left wondering if tywin had anticipated the possibility of jaime doing something like that i am pretty sure margery looked so uncomfortable because she knew tyrion was completely blameless and he was being railroaded into a conviction no doubt she is politically ambitious and clever but i think she also genuinely likes people and she seems to have a sense of right and wrong she may well have hoped that he would prove his innocence and no one would be unjustly punished it must be obvious to her that tyrion being found guilty is going to have nothing to do with justice speaking of which  is tywin really serious when he says that tyrion will get a fair trial  i actually think he really believes that though i find it hard to credit it is that particular psychological trait related to his continuing disbelief that the dragons will play a part in a military threat to westeros the iron bank made the only sensible choice  they will get their money back whether the lannisters maintain control or stannis prevails from their perspective i would think that funding stannis will be a drop in the bucket with the potential of a very good return on their investment i find myself curious to know what they say behind closed doors about the possibility of a return to targayrian rule  do they have or want their fingers in that pie as well yaras rescue did seem a bit easily put off of course she didnt plan for the sort of problem she found and is likely upset i suppose the question is whether she will now go home or do something else clearly ramsey now thinks that theon is enough his creature that he can use him in a way that could be rather dangerous if he is wrong bronns status is an open question now did he know shae was not on that ship when it left  that seems pretty likely to me did he deliver her there at all or did he take her to those who would pay him the most and would be most likely to be able to advance his position unless he was totally ignorant he directly lied to tyrion about it "
"903" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-12 " ha but im really sure thats not true on the show isnt 16 of age i cant believe they want us to think tommen younger than 1314 with that margaery storyline "
"904" "GreenLake" 2014-05-12 " i took it to be a reaction to the way tyrion dismissed her of course he was desperate to save her and had to get her to leave against her wishes so he told her she was just a whore thats why in the trial she turned to him and very pointedly said something to the effect that she was just a whore she was taking revenge for a hurt that he had never truly intended "
"905" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " oooooh theres been some bad racism in westeros today its made my red viper go right small it has "
"906" "roganis" 2014-05-12 " all tyrion did was spend money on whores 1 designed a saddle to let bran ride a horse 2 gave wise advice to jon 3 rescued sansa from a cruel and humiliating beating at the hands of joffrey and im sure whatever money he spent on whores was more than any othe lord gave to them "
"907" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " id think that bronn is untrustworthy because he is so easily bought tyrion could outbribe almost anyone in westeros but not his father and sister "
"908" "Gnoway" 2014-05-12 " yara is her second name in the book in tv show name change to reduce confusion with someone else it is hard with a tv show to flip back and confirm who is who so small name change "

"918" "PlumRadio" 2014-05-12 " tyrion shouldt trus bronn anymore i think he had something to do with making shae testify at the trial "
"919" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " would you believethat it was just a coincidence "
"920" "Catch22" 2014-05-12 " we dont know which option he intends to take but i dont imagine the iron bank want to see their money squandered on fighting a zombie army in the freezing cold unless davos told them that they could have all the money in seven kingdoms and back the lannisters or anyone else with bushels of wheat to high heaven but that means diddly squat in the face of an army of white walkers no one is going to pay their debts when the world succumbs to a second human ice age think of it as a sort of financial insuranceliability investment preemptive risk management if you like "
"921" "PlumRadio" 2014-05-12 " imagine yara and arya as a team "
"922" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " dont forget she was one of the few people who spoke up for tyrion when sansa came to her anxious about their upcoming marriage margerey knows that tyrion saved the city and that this trial is unjust or she could just be bristling at the trial not going the way she and cersei had planned it who knows all we got from her this episode were a few facial expressions "
"923" "Desmond Miles" 2014-05-12 " it was expressly stated on the show last week he was not yet of age remember the scene with him and his grandfather over his elder brothers corpse that means hes significantly under 13 you want to be careful with they looked older line apparently its not a strong legal defence  "

"927" "Catch22" 2014-05-12 " so is oberyn going to fight for tyrion and the mountain for cersei i have no idea i havent read the books dont actually answer if you know that would be a spoiler but speculation is good "

"929" "PlumRadio" 2014-05-12 " do you think varys and littlefinger are in it together or not  "
"930" "aj2014" 2014-05-12 " loved the episode and cant wait to see it again later tonighta great episode but tyrion was absolutely brilliant sheer class dont want to give anything away but the trial by combat to come will surely surprise many and if you thought the red wedding was shocking wait till you see where this season is going if they go where i think they are i also felt sorry for theonreekbut really felt for tyrion when shae betrayed himalas for him it is not the only betrayal he will face he is a nice guy and in westeros  as on earth  nice guys often come last "
"931" "PlumRadio" 2014-05-12 " phew my mistake hell get the emmy again then "
"932" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " admittedly in the books she never rises above the ranks of tyrions whore so her betrayal isnt quite as shocking the show has done a lot more with her character so im interested in hearing the show shaes justification for her behaviour "
"933" "Catch22" 2014-05-12 " but it should be no ones first choice oh no i agree completely i loved how tyrion refused to hand over the power to his father that he is determined to maintain his agency until the end even if that end means trial by combat "
"934" "RasLob" 2014-05-12 " the trial by combat is a bit stupid it basically means that if your mate is handy with a sword you have a free pass through the westeros judicial system but it makes for good drama so ill allow it "
"935" "backfromtokyo" 2014-05-12 " the scenes with her feel rather perfunctory as though they know they have to include that part of the story but dont particularly like it makes you wonder how much of the ironborn stuff they will explore moving forward "
"936" "Catch22" 2014-05-12 " tyrion reminded him that hed never forget hed saved the city what does this mean im wondering is it a reference to the battle of the blackwater or to tyrions more mundane task of being a rather good master of coin trying to sort out the mess that little wandering accent left behind "
"937" "cybersuperhero" 2014-05-12 " i think varys actually respects tyrion as a person but he testifies against him because he feels its his duty to the crown also given varys vast knowledge of the happenings in kings landing if his testimony was anything other than meticulously detailed questions might be asked of his allegiance "
"938" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " i dug it if only to see ashayara kick some ass and ramsey chew the scenery also its important to see her getting on that boat and heading back to the iron islands "
"939" "MoreTears" 2014-05-12 " oooh a get smart reference "
"940" "dsk84" 2014-05-12 " i actually had goat meat last night for the first time in i dont know how long coincidence i think not "
"941" "MsEnvelop" 2014-05-12 " i dont understand the character shae and i am not happy why they did it this way she is far too smart and knows tyrion well enough to understand why tyrion wanted to send her away she is heartbroken and it was suggested in s4e1 that she is growing very jealous of sansa and getting tired of tyrions lack of affection but still i found it highly incredible that she would seek revenge in this fashion the shea whom we know from season 2 and 3 would not do that this uturn i found a bit mysogynistic i have not read the books and i am not familiar with the character there but the shae in the show was a very decent intelligent and brave character this just makes no sense "
"942" "Ernekid" 2014-05-12 " give peter dinklage an emmy a bafta a big pat on the back for his performance in this episode he was phenomenal his rant in court was the best ive seen on tv since i saw cranstons walter white unravel in the last series of breaking badthe interplay between tywin and his sons jaime and tyrion is incredible to watch charles dance nickolai costerwaldau and peter dinklage have made these characters come to life incredibly well conleth hill deserves credit for his brilliant performance as varys too hes a true talent having mark gatiss in anything is nice and he was great as the iron banker i love this show i love it i love it i love it "
"943" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-12 " hes an icelander i think but more importantly hes tywins luca brasi "
"944" "FormicaAtomica" 2014-05-12 " aah yes shae just like the rest of them this part and subsequent parts of the books really hit me deep deep deep deep might not be able to watch "
"945" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " if varys helps tyrion it will have to be behind the scenes where the queen isnt watching that scene he had with the red viper is a reminder that as a foreigner and a commoner varys can vanish without a trace based on whim of the nobility "
"946" "roganis" 2014-05-12 " the mountain hasnt his head at least been offered to oberyn could oberyn elect to come off the judging panel to fight on tyrions behalf then im glad im still on the first book as i enjoy reading the various spoiler free guesses here "
"947" "dsk84" 2014-05-12 " he seemed to have the look of someone that knows more about it than hes letting on but very interested none the less "
"948" "backfromtokyo" 2014-05-12 " margaery didn’t look very happy at tyrion’s trial surely this is because in the show she knows for a fact that he didnt kill joffrey it wouldnt make sense for her to be comfortable with whats happening after oleannas revelation "
"949" "Macra Bill" 2014-05-12 " i was wondering about the tyrells too it was really hard to judge what they were thinking was loras frustrated by the trial or simply bored margery looked shocked sometimes but surely she doesnt care about the fate of tyrion "

"952" "dsk84" 2014-05-12 " tyrion would pick jaime hands down if only well you know his first choice would probably be bronn now but bronn is what he is im just glad he wasnt there to openly betray tyrion like some of the others "
"953" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " actually he wont hell be in the best supporting actor category as he was last year with aaron paul john slattery and the like where hell have a better chance at winning the cast of friends despite ostensibly being the leads of their show were also entered in the best supporting actor category got has such a large cast that it kind of makes sense to put the lead in the supporting category i agree that mcconaghy or harrelson is a lock this year "
"954" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-12 " tyrion wont choose jamie  he knows first hand how disabled he now is as a swordsman left hand coaching from bronn gratis could be bronn himself but after someone directed me to the upcoming episode titles i rather suspect two other champions "
"955" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-12 " he didnt say where that army was heading the iron bank gave him money to take kings landing as a better bet than the lannisters without tywin but last season ended with davos  melisandre suggesting stannis should go north we dont know which option he intends to take but i dont imagine the iron bank want to see their money squandered on fighting a zombie army in the freezing cold "
"956" "Macra Bill" 2014-05-12 " nothing on those littlefinger and varys scenes though "
"957" "MoreTears" 2014-05-12 " actually no dinklage competes in the supporting actor category "
"958" "candylilacs" 2014-05-12 " i think he would be a great addition to castle black too but it should be no ones first choice kind of a dull life especially for tyrion  but all he did was spend loads of money on whores really castle black would be cheaper to the lannisters especially now since theyre poor "
"959" "PlumRadio" 2014-05-12 " that was sure a strange question tyrion asked varys at the trial and the answer was strange as well hum will varys find another way to help tyrion later on "

"963" "candylilacs" 2014-05-12 " i too didnt like it im not a fan of four plotlines going at once i thought the two  in westeros and meeren were enough that said i also dont like stannisdavos as much as other characters "
"964" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-12 " yes that bothered me too i kept thinking hmm the goatherds of donegal have got a lot less freckled these days "
"965" "Catch22" 2014-05-12 " oh yes and i cant help but think tywins assured statement that dragons have not won a war for three hundred years might come back to haunt him oberyn looked very interested in the dany and dragons intel "
"966" "Macra Bill" 2014-05-12 " i guess it works showing how gone theon or should i say reek actually is but surely there would have been a better way when yara mentioned all that stuff about gathering up the best killers etc i was hyped for her storyline but all we got was that i absolutely love davos and im almost scared to i feel that like everything else in westeros hes going to do something horrible soon to make me wary of him i loved danys scenes her slavefreeing halo was just a bit too heavenly time to bring it down to earth a bit "
"967" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " remember that show margerey is both more important and far shrewder than she is in the books this margerey is definitely aware of her grandmothers scheming and as such might feel a pang of guilt at seeing tyrion being railroaded also as seen last episode she has a vested interested at seeing tyrion being executed guilty or not i still dont know why loras is there however "
"968" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-12 " was it not obvious  therefore unsaid what davos wanted the iron money for unless i mistaken it is to refurbish stanniss army  fleet for his next assault did i misunderstand you "

"971" "dsk84" 2014-05-12 " it was to emphasize just how far gone theon is now whether they could have used another plot vehicle to get the point across i dont know but i think it was fairly effective in that regard he could have had his freedom but he just acted like an animal which is really what ramsay has turned him into "
"972" "Catch22" 2014-05-12 " the thing about the dragon scene was why the hell two people dressed like sinbad the sailor were herding goats in what looked like the vale of glencoe mereen is not as far as i know fort william "
"973" "thelinesinthesand" 2014-05-12 " i think the scene was in so we could see how reek has completely forgotten who he was that he is now loyal to ramsay snow ramsay now knows he is completely loyal and wants him to pretend to be theon greyjoy "
"974" "AndyMitchell" 2014-05-12 " welcome back varys you have been missed i agree with those sentiments but i found his part in this weeks episode a little odd first his scene with the prince whilst very enjoyable seemed a little too revealing to a man he does not know well and equally i was a bit surprised at the manner in which he gave evidence it felt to me out of character and i was left a little disappointed in him perhaps i need to watch the episode again "

"979" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-12 " varys supports the throne rather than any political faction right now he presumably feels tommen with tywin pulling strings is best for stability therefore tyrion is expendable however he is not entirely without morals and this felt shame when tyrion reminded him that hed never forget hed saved the city "
"980" "Macra Bill" 2014-05-12 " true but it just seemed so rushed she spent all that time gathering up the best killers from the iron islands making that speech about him being her brother and next thing you know hes dead to her because she had to do a jog away from a few dogs "
"981" "cybersuperhero" 2014-05-12 " i think jaime reserves to right to turn down the opportunity to champion either side and quite rightly because with one hand hed really be in the shit "

"983" "PlumRadio" 2014-05-12 " the oberyn and varys scene in front of the iron throne was brilliant "
"984" "Catch22" 2014-05-12 " cant he go on a rampage and kill everyone and then hang around afterwards enjoying the victory until jon snow turns up in kings landing when winter finally arrives i would just love an entire episode of the two of them chewing the fat oberyn all knowing lip curls jon all monosyllabic snarls while propping up a bar in flea bottom as the city falls to a bunch of crazed blue eyed ice zombies "
"985" "dsk84" 2014-05-12 " i was actually waiting for this to come up before i went off to bed didnt want to miss out on all the fun on to the episode it was good but that last scene with tyrion elevated it to something more than just that more on that later i guess that bit with yara was kind of out of the blue i had forgotten about her attempted rescue mission to be honest i was wondering where the were going with it but it seems it had the sole purpose of showing just how broken reektheon really is living with the dogs he did seem to think he was an animal biting away at yara though about yara one of my cousins had sent me this imagine a while ago httpsphotoshakfbcdnnethphotosakfrc3q71s720x720104471110201443995411708431187776njpg a bit harsh but not necessarily untrue though it was a female cousin who had sent it if that makes it more acceptable or not always good to see ser davos and his voice of reason wasnt sure if his impassioned pitch would work but it did end up doing its job i am glad that it did if for no other reason than the daggers stannis was giving him for dragging him so far only to be brushed away interesting to see where the go now i didnt mind danys scene this week to be honest shes learning the consequences of her actions and also that of her dragons whether hizdahr was telling the truth or not im not sure but you could tell that dany appeared to be second guessing her actions for a moment the episode was really all about what happened in kings landing though glad they gave oberyn more screen time he did seem like the only member of the small council with a spine and principles which is funny considering how hes seen as a bit of a degenerate the trial was absolutely farcical  oberyn and jaime could see it easily maergery as well i guess but she was privy to information the others werent good of jaime to go to tywin but even he probably didnt expect tywin to say what he did so he did seem a bit shocked that he had agreed shaes scene seemed weakforced again though tyrion made up for it as you could tell how pained he was then he absolutely killed it in the end despite all the brilliant moments hes had that may well have been his best yet "
"986" "candylilacs" 2014-05-12 " although i read the books i totally blanked on tyrions trial  but then i saw shae and recalled how this wasnt going to be good for him i do dislike how everyone does tywins bidding including jaime so i was happy to see that not only was tyrion choosing trial by combat to forgo the farce of a trial but also to put a spoke in tywins wheel an entire trial to just rid himself of a son whos a dwarf as for daenerys well ruling is not just about golden crowns and pretty dresses its hours listening to your people and advisors  although you would think that she would have a little audience with the queen triage probably only the most important cases should gain an audience i do like oberyn too it seems hes the only one thats not voting guilty from the onset of the trial like sarah i was trying to figure out what the cutscenes to the tyrells were about im thinking its because margaery knows it wasnt tyrion but is saying nothing but appearing more and more uncomfortable i did like when tyrion said he wanted trial by combat that loras very subtly nodded as if this was a wise and interesting choice missed bronn completely in this trial  so i wonder where he is and did tyrion get no witnesses character or otherwise my husband asked do you think cersei believes all this what shaes saying at the trial i said that it probably didnt matter she would probably believe anything negative about tyrion and convince herself it was true "
"987" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-12 " not so sure i think the audience already know they could be toast from 200 feet my wife often shows me the toys our errant dog has destroyed  hence i no longer need to see video evidence bad dragon "
"988" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-12 " i too would find that deeply satisfying the iron bank went with stannis because davos convinced them that he would honour his debts and not lie i would argue that davos was a bit disingenuous  never said what he wanted the money for "
"989" "cybersuperhero" 2014-05-12 " great dramatic ending to the show although im disappointed theyve delayed the announcing of each sides champion since its one of hell of a twist also very pleased to see mark gatiss in the show i remember him back in the heady days of league of gentlemen and thought they gave davos a bit of development by showing how he really feels about stannis ramsay snow evil bastard both figuratively and literally he may be is actually a brilliantly sharp character his youve got bigger balls than he ever had line to yara im sure she was called asha in the books was almost as good as tyrions final speech "
"990" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " theyve used that shot in every single advertisement for the fourth season so im glad they finally decided to use it on the show "
"991" "PlumRadio" 2014-05-12 " hes going to be in the same category with cranston matthew mccaughey and woody harrelson "
"992" "Macra Bill" 2014-05-12 " cersei would be gutted if jaime fought for tyrion "
"993" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-12 " i dont know i think they had to show her actually arriving to rescue her brother given shed vowed to i thought it was sad when she eventually rejected him "
"994" "Catch22" 2014-05-12 " i demand to have some booze this is quite clearly the most sensible of all possible demands especially in a situation such as this "
"995" "Catch22" 2014-05-12 " that was an awesome episode the boredom of public administration the mockery of justice and the all important political economy of rule i would find it somewhat satisfying that in a show with dragons zombie ice men gratuitous nudity and violence romantic notions of freedom and monumental armies if the iron throne was won by those with the best budgeting and banking skills other observations prince oberyn is awesome all those sly knowing smiles during the council meeting hes definitely planning something is he going to be called on to fight on tyrions behalf just why did the iron bank see fit to bank role stannis are the lannisters going to be ultimately undone by the sweet irony of an inability to pay their debts while tyrions masterful refusal to be made to supplicate himself at the hands of a corrupt power and except such an injustice was outstanding i would have liked to think of him at castle black again with jon he could probably sort out there severe logistical problems they could use his skills "
"996" "Macra Bill" 2014-05-12 " can anyone give me a spoiler free answer to why varys turned on tyrion so harshly and what he meant by he remembers everything "
"997" "PlumRadio" 2014-05-12 " i had the same thought watching it "
"998" "roganis" 2014-05-12 " ok will tyrion choose jaime and then tywin choose bronn or viceversa except tywin wouldnt want to have anyone kill jaime if tyrion chooses him great trial scene "
"999" "backfromtokyo" 2014-05-12 " that sweeping opening shot of sailing into braavos was a thing of beauty too "
"1000" "BeheadtheRoyals" 2014-05-12 " come on you dwarfs tyrion the guilty to win the trial by combat wholl champion for him "
"1001" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-12 " ooo will it proverbially drop perchance "
"1002" "Macra Bill" 2014-05-12 " i would usually agree but i think the audience needed to see it first hand how wild the dragons are now i mean look how close that kid was to the sheep it has a much more powerful effect "
"1003" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-12 " but clearly not on the show where he looks more like 1314 so yes younger but not hugely so "
"1004" "PlumRadio" 2014-05-12 " tyrion is the shit brilliant "
"1005" "backfromtokyo" 2014-05-12 " each to their own but i thought dinklage and dance were both great ramsay is much hammier than either "
"1006" "Macra Bill" 2014-05-12 " that yara scene was a bit pointless "
"1007" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-12 " productionwise did they really need the whole dragon popping out to the local kentucky fried sheep for a snack must have cost ano wedge on cgi after all and necessitated a cut back elsewhere the narrative would have worked just fine had the shepherd just brought in his bag of still smouldering bones to see danny "
"1008" "Steve Cook" 2014-05-12 " mycroft great episode what a kick in the nads for tyrion though as if varys sticking the knife in wasnt bad enough but shae is anybody in this world ever happy didnt take long for dany to realise that wielding the cumbersome sword of justice is likely to end up causing quite a bit of collateral damage "
"1009" "Jez Holland" 2014-05-12 " manners cost nothing well except maybe the iron price "
"1010" "roganis" 2014-05-12 " i think we can say that there are probably many pirates here today who enjoyed the braavosi bath scenes "
"1011" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " that penny will be important later im glad benioff and weiss made a point to include it in this episode "
"1012" "magicallybored" 2014-05-12 " calls to arms are not strong points of the greyjoys first theons cringe effort back in winterfell and yaras unconvincing effort en route to dreadfort credit where its due however she is a polite murderer last cage on the rightthank youslits throat "
"1013" "Jez Holland" 2014-05-12 " i demand to have some booze "
"1014" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-12 " first things first loving the addition of bravos and its penny slot machine thingy to the opening titles "
"1015" "backfromtokyo" 2014-05-12 " i bow down to dinklage hes always good but in this episode he was bloody brilliant when he turned on the crowd and said that hed saved the city but he wished hed let them all die that he wished hed killed joffrey that hed gladly poison them all right now most of all when he said “im guilty of being a dwarf ive been on trail for that my entire life” … fantastic "
"1016" "Desmond Miles" 2014-05-12 " there was also an interesting contrast drawn between dany and tommen two young rulers reasonably close in age i thought dommen is 9 years old at this stage whereas daenerys at least in the show is now in her early 20 "
"1017" "gregorypeck" 2014-05-12 " i demand trial by hodor "
"1018" "DMcCool" 2014-05-12 " woof that was much more fun nothing like a good court drama to liven things up a bit dinklage was a bit hammy but another masterclass from charles dance we even got more than one facial expression from dragonbitch this week after last week ive given up trying to resist being an oberyn fanboy it is so painly obvious that he is yet another cool character pretty specifically targeting me as an ideal fan i know what happens to likable characters here but fuck it bisexual warrior poet im on this ride til the end i dont care where its going the bastard of the bolton wanderers is also a delight on paper the character is unbelievably cheesey bmovie horror stuff but weve been treated with an eyepopping committed performance action movie cheese aside all of the scenes with bolton wanderers bastard were a treat totally gleefully evil a bit excited for the next episode now hope we see the plot progress more than in some previous episodes in my humble opinion the show always does better when it allows one story to develop a little longer as the trial did in this episode chopping and changing constantly between endless side stories does make for addicting telly in a skinnerbox sort of way but ultimately leaves the viewer someone unsatisified whos with me "
"1019" "bleudegex" 2014-05-12 " oberyn is so much fun to have around i cant figure out if hes going to hang around winding people up for the next couple of series or if hes about to go on a rampage and kill everyone "
"1020" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " best to get it out of the way quickly and hodor "
"1021" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-12 " oh awesome thats absolutely brilliant featuring tywin lannister as a hard and not even especially fair judge  with a walkon for ramsay snow as killer of the week "
"1022" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-12 " i saved you i saved this city all your worthless lives i should have let stannis kill all of you give that man the emmy give him all the emmys and the golden globes and the tonys peter dinklage is a great dancer after all 3 cheers for law and order westeros and how great was that overhead shot of braavos that coin rolling down the canals in the introduction was amazing too cgi well spent "
