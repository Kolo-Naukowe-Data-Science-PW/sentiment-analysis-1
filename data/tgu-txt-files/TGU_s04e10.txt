"2" "Jez Holland" 2014-06-26 " if it follows the same as the last 3 seasons it will be out around feb 15 with a ton of extras "
"3" "Buntyroo" 2014-06-25 " say what you like about stannis hes got his priorities right going to fight the killer zombie things in the snow rather than pissing about arguing and jousting down south "
"4" "TrinityX" 2014-06-25 " to stop shae raising the alarm but i think it’s made quite clear that tyrion does what he does because of a combination of love hatred selfloathing and despair that and the fact she grabbed a knife and tried to kill him after returning to kings landing for the sole purpose of giving damning evidence entirely made up to make sure he died all for sending her away from a dangerous place i loved shae but i was disappointed at how blinkered she could be and well never find out what happened to her when she was 13 at one point that seemed to be really leading up to something "
"5" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-24 " it sounds to me like it is ambiguous  they might just change the order of what happens which actually seems quite reasonable to me what i found more disturbing was what he said about how he understands sandors story it seems less significant than possibly leaving out the other thing since it isnt what you might call a plot point but thematically a big mistake i think "
"6" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-24 " so are their offspring just clones of the parents then "
"7" "malevoisine" 2014-06-24 " well done ser "

"9" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-06-24 " dragons are asexual "
"10" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-23 " in the scene jaime told him to knock on the door to alert and varys will come tyrion raises his hand to knock but then hesitates as if something has occurred to him and he goes the other way next thing we see him enter a room with an ironwork screen with an image f a lion on it and the badge of the hand lying next to the bed so presumably now that he is out and he decides to head to his dads room before going to varys to have a conversation or kill him who knows maybe he doesnt know when he gets there shae is totally unexpectedly in his bed and that really determines most of what happens after that it seems that many people missed the lion symbol and its significance "
"11" "Simon Thomson" 2014-06-23 " but i agree with the op i really dont get why tyrion went awandering through the castle presumably he was looking for his father  but why a few scenes here left a gap which we had to fill by imagining oh she must have thought  done  said such and such thats why theyre now in that place  doing that thing i dont mind working hard as a viewer but it felt to me as if there may have been a lot of deleted scenes lying around because they had to fit it into the time they had "
"12" "Johneeo" 2014-06-23 " could the hound live on loved him and aryan great duo "
"13" "keef1980" 2014-06-23 " dont know how possible it is but do you reckon theres any chance of having a sofai guardian book club where we can read or reread the books and discuss wouldnt even need an article though itd be good to have one just cos i really enjoyed this blog seems a shame to not be able to discuss the books as i read them "

"24" "MrWednesday" 2014-06-22 " yes indeed "
"25" "Steven Roche" 2014-06-22 " maisie williams really needs more credit what a stunning performance she gave this season a baftaemmy nom is required "
"26" "Steven Roche" 2014-06-22 " well done sir or rather ser "
"27" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-22 " they ignored this in the show however it was one of the main reasons for sacking the various cities in the book and issues of army camp life in general were more in the forefront tv wars in general dont seem terribly interested in logistics "
"28" "MrMsyvc" 2014-06-21 " ditto on the great acting from dinklage i hope they dont kill him off "
"29" "Anopheles" 2014-06-21 " its the guys mance sent up the wall in his explanation to john i feel sorry for theyre in for a big surprise "
"30" "chriskilby" 2014-06-21 " time is notoriously relative in got the white walkers undead army and danerys living one have to move at a snails pace because the mechanics of the plot demand it the final climactic battle between the living and the dead cant very well take place until danys dragons are fully grown hence all the faffing about not least the increasingly irrelevant bickering over whose arse sits on the iron throne which was always a distraction and just so much padding before the main event things happen in stories because they have to not necessarily because they make sense and all stories have inconsistencies or plot holes if you want to pick holes in them  from shakespeare to dickens star wars to  yes  game of thrones the craft of storytelling lies in how well such plot mechanics are disguised or plot holes hidden i dont have a problem with this in got  it is quality padding after all but it depends on how patient you are or just how willing you are to suspend your disbelief i suppose some fans doctor who fans especially arent prepared to willingly suspend their disbelief so much as an inch off the floor it seems to me which is bizarre frankly under the circumstances "
"31" "Empedokles" 2014-06-21 " timescales in got are whacky sure enough even weirder however is the wonderfully cavalier way in which logistics are ignored what for example did that vast army of unsullied do for food and water while traipsing merrily through the desert wastes "
"32" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-21 " sure  but it does have to maintain a certain level of credibility or it becomes impossible to suspend disbelief which is kind of what i am saying  the difference in timescales is not so out of whack that it should be a problem in that way it isnt something that needs to be nailed down to the minute "
"33" "sonmi" 2014-06-21 " agreed there are plenty of individual elements from books 4 and 5 i really like but all of that i found excruciating "
"34" "sezame" 2014-06-21 " yes because he slowly strangled her with the necklace of the hand after a brief interesting conversation and then went off to kill daddy dearest and had an more interesting conversation before zap "
"35" "sezame" 2014-06-21 " perhaps the dragons can vanquish the white walkers "
"36" "chriskilby" 2014-06-21 " uh guys youre arguing plausibility practicality and logistics about a show with dragons and zombies in it let it go it is just a tv show "
"37" "GJSmith" 2014-06-21 " i think varys intended to return after helping tyrion escape but after tyrion had murdered the kings hand and the alarm bells rang he realised that the consequences would be much harder to escape "
"38" "GJSmith" 2014-06-21 " dire wolves they are hardly ever shown "
"39" "chriskilby" 2014-06-20 " i suspect bran is the most important character in it the professor x of westeros his emerging powers are potentially limitless if he could warg dragons and white walkers at the same time gots final battle could be very short indeed "
"40" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-20 " it is farther to braavos but travel by ship is really just significantly faster the troops stannis brought arent his own they are a mercenary company on salladors ships all likely found in braavos itself and the food again bought in braavos so some time to assemble but not as much as one might think especially compared to assembling wildlings and foraging on the march the distance between castle black and eastwatch was covered by horse likely on a forced march and could be done i think fairly quickly as far as mance goes we arent even all that clear on when he actually sets out from the mountains he was waiting there for all the disparate parts of his army to arrive the men he sent jon with could have been sent ahead well before he got the main body of the army moving and an army that size is very slow to get moved out and to get stopped and reorganized for battle as well i just dont think its all that unbelievable  the action is slow for tv but not i think unrealistic stannis movement is probably unusually efficient or at least it seems that way as theyve presented it but not so far out that id say it ruins things "
"41" "Pepa01" 2014-06-20 " braavos not davos sorry "
"42" "Pepa01" 2014-06-20 " also there is distance between the sea and castle black "
"43" "Pepa01" 2014-06-20 " yes but have you seen the map davos is like 70 times further away than mance was and assemble an army takes time think only of the time it takes to load the ships with food and drink for such a long trip plus i dont think stanis travel to davos to ask for a loan with his full army he didnt have boats so probably he would have to stop in dragonstone in his way back to pick up the troops no way he could do it so fast "
"44" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-20 " i think hed have been worse off if theyd left him but in any case i dot think that really reflects how people understood the role of a servant or liegeman for that matter and i dont mean that in a negative way at all it was a different kind of bond where they were all in it together in a sense in some ways more like a family relationship "
"45" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-20 " remember that at the beginning the wildlings were still being mustered together so they were waiting  that is what mance was doing in the mountains but an army like the wildling army would be lucky to make 10 miles a day and half that would be more likely even if they carried food for people an army like that has to spend significant amounts of time gathering fodder or allowing animals to graze depending on the winds a ship could potentially go much faster maybe 150 nautical miles in a day and moving around a professional army of mercenaries ready to travel would be quicker once they were on land an army with a logistics train supplied mainly by ship might travel at something like 20 miles a day on foot and apparently stannis men were on horseback "
"46" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-20 " as far as being an adaptation i think got is actually sticks to the source far more than is common and as you say there always have to be adaptations for a different medium errors to me are changes or presentations that in some way undermine the story itself or which just dont get the story across my feeling is that the producers really get the story and what it is supposed to be about and so when there are less than perfect decisions it is usually a matter of misjudging what the effect will be or just a point that is very difficult to adapt "
"47" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-20 " tyrion i dont think appears in book 4 the way martin wrote books four and five is that they are divided geographically so book four gives all the action inn several locations and book five what is happening at the same time in other parts of the world although i think there are a few online versions that put the two books together according to a standard narrative and thats what the television version will do so you could try one of those a lot of people felt that the geographical division wasnt terribly successful and its a frustration for people whose favorite characters arent in book four if you are a relatively quick reader it isnt so bad though ive actually wondered if brans story on the show might not have benefited from a bit more foreshadowing  people seem to be a bit at sea about what the point of it is and so have lost some interest "
"48" "Dustin James" 2014-06-20 " i never read the books but i know that its a probability she will likely rule westeroos now with her father dead she has shown before that she has little regard for the people she will now rule remember when she wanted to give the leftover food from jofferys wedding to the dogs instead of the poor she doesnt have the guile to hold and wield power like her father the people will turn on her and her downfall is inevitable "
"49" "pavanne" 2014-06-20 " absolutely in the book she was killed for basically doing what he told her to pretending to love him and for quite rationally jumping ship to save her skin ok bookshae should have taken the danger more seriously and taken his offer to get out but she was pretty much an innocent victim "
"50" "Sunburst" 2014-06-20 " theres going to be a season 5 omg sorry for this horrific spoiler "
"51" "randombloke" 2014-06-20 " 2 when the 3 eyed crow said to bran you will fly surely he means on or as a dragon possibly drogon its either that or the moon door "
"52" "randombloke" 2014-06-20 " a word about hodor i understand that its a violation to warg into him but on the show at least its been absolutely necessary to save his own life and that of bran on each and every occasion what more morally dubious in my opinion is bringing hodor along on this quest in the first place all of the other members of the party can understand the dangers inherent in their voyage and can consent to facing them but hodor has had his life put in danger without understanding what he is doing "
"53" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-20 " because ships are quick and moving an army of 100000 with women children livestock etc is very slow "
"54" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-20 " that was my impression of the books too  i may try them after tv series has finished tho "
"55" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-20 " also if jon snow is descended from who everyone thinks he is  shouldnt he be able to tame one "
"56" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-20 " also not a br book reader thinking same thing  "
"57" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-20 " madness  "
"58" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-20 " rory mccann has such amazing presence  if sandor is gone he will be the most sorely missed character when he fights you just totally believe that he is a warrior  more so than ned stark jaime or oberyn i hope mr mccann gets some more parts where we see him shine "
"59" "chriskilby" 2014-06-20 " thats an inevitability though surely cersei isnt anywhere near as clever as she thinks she is and her comeuppance is longoverdue all good things and that lena headys great btw it cant be easy playing such a loathsome character so well not when online pinheads and i suspect misogynists have trouble distinguishing between the actor and the role they play i bet jack gleasons glad to put joffrey behind him for similar reasons it cant be easy popping down to your local for a pint with something like that hanging over you "
"60" "chriskilby" 2014-06-20 " its a dilemma to be sure i am a complete spoilerphobe ordinarily and generally prefer to watch the adaptation first cos youll always get more out of the book afterwards danys premonition of the red wedding in book ii say and i think ive just read a massive hint at where bran could be heading while reading the books first can often lead to disappointment when favourite scenes and sometimes characters dont make it on to the screen for obvious reasons of narrative streamlining or running time but i am so hooked on got now im kinda desperate to find out what happens next especially to tyrion and varys i guess ill read the first four books then see how my will power holds out  gah incidentally i dont understand the sort of purists who complain when changes are made adapting material for the screen the key word is adaptation david cronenberg was asked once why he adapts so many unfilmable books to which he replied all books are unfilmable changes always have to be made sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse a good adaptation will always be faithful to the spirit of the original if not the letter take la confidential one of the greatest film adaptations of a book ever made i thought the film was complex till i read the book how they made that film out of that book i will never know but it wasnt without wholesale changes to the plot the characters and crucially the timescale of the book not to mention the fate of certain characters and yet la confidential is still faithful to the spirit of the book the same but different which is why its so good what has happened to hbos longmooted adaptation of james ellroys underworld usa trilogy now that i would love to see and two books in i would say the same of game of thrones which is remarkably faithful to the spirit and letter of the booksi kinda like it when they make changes which work especially when they improve on or are more satisfying than the original  i believe brienne v the hound falls into that category i love surprises me also adaptations can be too slavish sacrilege i know but ive always thought what few changes watchmen made to the overrated original were improvements  especially the ending oh and mediocre books tend to make for better films cos they cant help but improve on their sources few in their right mind would still claim that jaws or the godfather arent as good as the books "
"61" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-20 " i am inclined to agree "
"62" "ocelot75" 2014-06-20 " isnt it that the man in the tree is going to teach him how to warg into a dragon my thoughts exactly catch22 remember the vision bran had at the tree dragon flying over kings landing only two dragons got locked up hmmm "
"63" "Jez Holland" 2014-06-20 " interesting but this interview contradicts that httpcollidercomgameofthronesseason34georgerrmartininterview i will pull out the quote from it that seems to say we are both incorrect david and dan what was the specific question that george asked you dan weiss he asked us “who is jon snow’s mother” we had discussed it before and we gave a shocking answer at that point george didn’t actually say whether or not we were right or wrong but his smile was his tell we knew we had passed the wonka test at that point read more at httpcollidercomgameofthronesseason34georgerrmartininterviewiw1dwwdbtcj7arrb99 "

"66" "Dustin James" 2014-06-20 " the good thing is cerseis downfall is upcoming cant stand that bitch but at least shes hot "
"67" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-20 " if i were you i would either stop at the end of book three or read four and five which happen concurrently i guess it depends somewhat on how you feel about knowing what happens before it happens personally i really like knowing the background information that isnt in the show and really never could be and having the character narratives things like the mythology songs and stories religious customs and such really add a lot of depth to the tv presentation for me  i enjoy it a lot more than i would have otherwise on the other hand what the show uniquely offers  the visual aspect  can be enjoyed just as much having read it all first "
"68" "Pepa01" 2014-06-20 " i dont understand how stanis managed to get a loan assembled an army and made it to the wall in two chapters while the wildlings took the whole season to get to castle black i havent liked most of the season at some point i almost gave it up lots of pointless storylines and waste of time in irrelevant and disgusting violence scenes but i have to recognise the last two chapters were really good "

"75" "chriskilby" 2014-06-19 " i have a question ive started reading the books  im almost finished the second one should i continue reading them after i get to the end of the fourth one or should i keep going and spoilers be damned "
"76" "chriskilby" 2014-06-19 " another recurring theme this season appeared to be characters going wrong tyrion arya and the increasingly thatcherite danerys complete with disturbing leni reifenstahlchancellor palpatine hero shot in one episode a nazilike targaryan flag fluttering ominously overhead once again danerys learned there’s more to being a warrior queen than freeing slaves even freeing slaves isn’t that straightforward that starving former slave curiously reminded me of life of brian’s old exleper who jesus robbed of his livelihood – no pleasing some people that old dude seemed familiar i wonder who he was then there was stannis’ soldier riding past and casually cutting down that wilding like in holy grail there’s been a lot of python references this season after davos’ “kerniggit” in season three this was only compounded by the breaker of chains having to put even heavier chains on her own children oh the irony nothing is ever straightforward or clear cut in game of thrones that’s why it’s so good and so much better than the rest of its reassuringly black  white and it must be said immature genre arya isn’t alone tyrion understandably embittered by betrayal injustice and heartbreak is in danger of becoming the very monster everyone thinks he is while for all her good intentions it’s pretty clear where danerys could be heading – we all know what the road to hell is paved with dany and tyrion could yet prove to be each other’s unlikely salvation though the charred skeleton of that little girl and her father’s grief was unbearable how do you solve a problem like drogon i sense an unlikely how to train your dragon crossover in the offing tyrion might not believe in dragons yet but he knows an awful lot about them a teasing detail in the first book which i’ve just finished is that tyrion is always reading about dragons maybe varys and ser barristan will put a good word in for tyrion with danerys this was a quietly heartbreaking episode for jon tyrion dany and even the hound all the more affecting because it was handled with such sensitivity and restraint without recourse to hysteria or histrionics ygritte’s funeral pyre was reminiscent of the master’s which was reminiscent of darth vader’s by the way incredibly though the tenderest moment belonged to tormond giantsbane wulf sternhammer of all people “did you love her” rougher than a hound’s arse it was good to see him and mance rayder still alive to cause havoc another season officially hbo’s biggest ever show surpassing even the sopranos and a genuine cultural phenomenon now inevitably some fans insist that game of thrones “isn’t as good as it used to be” that’s what “fans” do bless but while some episodes are better than others game of thrones’ quality remains remarkably consistent after four seasons i honestly don’t think one season is better than another they’re all equally good long may it continue now if you’ll excuse me i’m off to watch seasons 14 back to back see you next year winter is coming when valar morghulis whatever that means "
"77" "chriskilby" 2014-06-19 " this episode really shoulda been called the hound and the maiden fair season four has cruelly stretched viewers’ loyalties to breaking point constantly reminding us what ruthless murdering bastards even the “good” guys are ygritte the hound then forcing popular characters to face off  jon and ygritte this reached its harrowing apotheosis with the hound v brienne of fucking tarth – a momentous event my missus reliably informs me wasn’t in the books the only true “knights” in westeros worthy of the title i didn’t want either of them to die and was scared shitless they both would gits there was a real sense of life and death struggle here with a desperate and increasingly feral brienne biting spitting and finally smashing the hound’s head in with a rock ouch before that they even booted each other in the balls this was one of got’s best locations yet was that northern ireland too it looked kinda volcanic iceland maybe it was how i’d always imagined obi wan kenobi’s fateful battle with anakin skywalkerdarth vader if only the climactic duel in revenge of the sith had been this good or that sweary – “you were the fucking chosen one” gwendoline christie always looked a bit stiff and awkward in her earlier fight scenes but my god she’s improved after this she better have a goddamn lightsabre in her hand in star wars i’m still hoping she’s the iconic female villain that franchise has been crying out for – tarth vader no suit yourselves the hound’s had a good season – “lots of cnts” but this was without doubt his best episode yet unexpectedly confronted with a rival protector for arya and near death he hoped the hound’s gruff mask finally slipped begging for mercy and poignantly revealing he has no happy memories  sniff  but only after finally admitting that he was protecting arya after all never one to mince his fucking words the hound told it like it is in westeros “there is no safety you dumb bitch” while his bitter “i’ve been looking at lannister gold all my life” reeked of selfloathing the hound revealed longsuspected hidden depths here and achieved a certain tragic nobility which was surprisingly moving brienne would have been as well saying “cleaning woman” to the hound as calling him a knight though the fate of both cleganes seemed pretty cut and dried yet is far from certain even if it does look like the mountain’s fate could be the same as khal drogo’s or his longlost brother hodor’s “it may change him” what again so what else is new was this got’s slyest injoke yet the cleganes now join the growing list of characters whose fates are far from certain – benjen stark syrio florel they’re probably all dead but you never know season four had arguably the highest body count so far joffrey tywin oberyn ygritte grenn pyp jojen and shae and there was much rejoicing with the cleganes still pending how cruel was that though what a great and fanpleasing team arya and brienne would have made but it was not to be arya’s proving to be a right wee chip off the old hound  “you can shit later there’s people coming” then there was “i swore a sacred vow to protect your mother”“why didn’t you”ouch “fancy sword you’ve got there where did you get it”where indeed i wonder what arya’s reaction would have been if she knew what oathkeeper was forged from arya perhaps wisely decided she didn’t need anyone’s protection although her increasingly evil wee smile when brienne and the hound drew their swords was a source of growing concern arya was merciless vengeful and worst of all cold especially when she relieved the hound of his silver he taught her well – dead men have no need of silver before cruelly denying him the coup de grace he desperately craved what is happening to her and what is she turning into this is by far game of thrones’ most disturbing development is arya evil and what did melisandre see in arya’s eyes her own death by her hand the first season not to end with dany’s dragons – hinting at arya’s true significance – the “queen of the world” climax with arya leaving westeros behind and setting sail for an uncertain future in braavos was suitably rousing "

"80" "chriskilby" 2014-06-19 " looks like the rumours that charles dance could be doctor who’s new master weren’t just fanboy wishful thinking after all was this the best episode of game of thrones yet possibly the most gamechanging certainly with huge implications for where the show is heading and what or who it’s really about – gamechanger of thrones following the revelations here the petty squabbling over who sits on the iron throne which tellingly barely warranted a mention is more irrelevant than ever season four was very much about consequences and hasn’t shied away from the human cost of war the aftermath of battle the carnage the suffering the dead bodies so much sanitised science fiction and fantasy goes out of its way to avoid but game of thrones gleefully rubs our noses in this season began with the war seemingly over and tywin lannister triumphant – the ritualistic melting down of ned stark’s sword and that dire wolf pelt ohsosymbolically thrown on the fire only for him to end up dead while sitting on another sort of throne entirely at the hand of the one character everyone underestimates at their peril we never did find out if tywin lannister actually does shit gold be careful what you wish for the lannisters are reaping what they sowed and what happened to the starks is now being visited on them long may it continue a house divided cannot stand and the lannisters are their own worst enemies who said “not while arya stark’s still breathing” with joffrey dead boohoo tywin skewered and tyrion gone jaime and cersei have shown their true colours at last jaime compassionate “farewell little brother” cersei spiteful “your legacy is a lie” both of them suicidally reckless cersei’s “i don’t care” echoed what jaime said when he raped her betraying a solipsistic nihilism bordering on a death wish  “noone likes us we don’t care” good luck with that “they’re so small i cannot see them i only care about what matters” no danger of hubris there cersei’s wedding to loras tyrell is very definitely off now along with any chance of her family surviving in any meaningful sense with tywin gone and an increasingly deranged cersei who isn’t nearly as clever or cunning as she thinks she is the power behind the throne once again it’s just a matter of time before she goes the full lady macbeth and the iron bank’s bailiffs are at the door wouldn’t it be delightfully ironic if the lannisters finally fell because they couldn’t pay their debts when a sneering cersei told margery tyrell what the rains of castermere was about she was oblivious to the obvious irony that the ambitious family which fatally overreached itself and whose doom she gleefully anticipated was clearly her own not the tyrells i have always imagined cersei’s final scene standing on the battlements of the red keep nose to nose with one of the very dragons she arrogantly denied the existence of – fwoosh fair dos to the wicked queen though at least she genuinely loves her children – it’s her one redeeming feature apart from her cheek bones unlike tywin who was obsessed with his legacy to the point of neglecting his actual children philip larkin was right "

"89" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-19 " although  in general you may be right i thought peoples reaction to tywin has interesting they find it hard to read him as less than what he presents himself as and i think with bronn sometimes people had a hard time thinking he might have really sold tyrion out because they enjoyed the actors performances so much "
"90" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-19 " are those impressions really the result of doing things the same way though for one thing i think if you interpret her actions as being merciless which i dont part of the reason it seems worse is that she isnt a confused 10 year old as well i would say that the hound being more sympathetic was something they did on purpose with the way they wrote his character they really removed most of his more antisocial behaviors and they added a lot more intimate scenes with him and arya and made her seem to respond to them she was consistently hostile to him in the book and the scene where he tells the story about gregor is quite different almost an aggressive act in itself "

"112" "elleesse" 2014-06-19 " what really disturbed me about this episode was arya and her very sudden descent into heartless coldness most of us got viewers wrestle with seeing characters who are good and bad at times and are emotionally manipulated so that they can sympathise or get warm fuzzy feelings for bad characters so it seems strange that after spending weeks with a protector of sorts that arya wouldnt develop a similar sort of if not affection then blurring of her hatred of clegane  this definitely was shown to be the case when she offered to wash his wounds yet when he way lying battered and bloody she just stared at him coldly totally uncaring and refused him the mercy of a quick death while he had at least shown that mercy to that last man they came across as her teacher and someone she was learning to kill from she conveniently skipped the mercy part in terms of aryas character it didnt make sense that after being shown her forming some kind of bond with the hound and cleaning his wounds to suddenly be back to i hate you i loathe you i despise you and the ability to turn and just leave him to die in agony it didnt make sense to me whatsoever apart from that i dont enjoy how theyve now made me dislike a character i used to enjoy watching not sure i will give a toss what happens to a stubborn knowitall bratty kid with all the empathy of a psychopath the backstory leading up to this point explaining how she came to be will all be for nowt if there is no shred of humanity left in her for viewers to connect with re shae and tyrion she absolutely had it coming and here is an example of someone knowing they have done wrong him whispering sorry as he sits by his now dead former lover despite his fury his hurt his need for vengeance he still has the capacity to know that what hes done is wrong and is genuinely sorry about it unlike arya who is pitiless yes it was a line crossed for his character however i think a good line to cross for him his one weakness in a way was that he didnt stoop to the level of others in terms of posing any real physical threat to anyone he always tried to sidestep that with words and manoeuvring he has finally realised that in the game of thrones despite the best efforts of tywin and he pen that the pen is not mightier than the sword now he also knows what he is capable of and has possibly learned that when other people are out to kill you no matter what else you try to do ultimately its kill or be killed and he sensibly chose to live and dispose of two people who specifically went out to snuff out his life in the future i presume other people he interacts with will sense that there is genuine danger if they mess with the dwarf and i think his character will also wear the sorrow and weariness of someone whos been through the mill rather than his previous cocky confidence "

"130" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-18 " it is being oversensitive and no one will take it seriously and so it is counterproductive saying next season dany will buy the farm when one of her dragons eats her is a spoiler saying and dany will have the surprise of her life when someone bites the hand that feeds him is an annoying hint spoiler saying there will be more of danys associated storylines and the wall will be an important story is not a spoiler  anyone can see those things are true even if they have never read any of the books and which would still be true if they both die in the first episode people are getting way out of hand with spoiler accusations and crap  i saw someone accused of spoiling the hobbit the other day for goodness sake in an online discussion a major literary work of the first half of the 20th century  next well get told that weve spoiled hamlet when its pointed out that everyone typically dies at the end of a tragedy heck a guy here has complained that people spoiled his surprise this episode because they reminded him of something that happened last season that he had forgotten people will just stop trying at all because what is the point maybe the book readers just realize that total surprise at everything that happens isnt always the most important thing in a story most people get a feel for the flow of the story anyway if you want to enjoy discussions about the story you have to deal with the fact that people will say things that might give you a hint about the general direction of the story maybe if you are clever about interpreting it and lucky that is the way it is with shows based on books or remakes of older shows or movies if it isnt worth it for you to have that happen from time to time you shouldnt read about it or discuss it with people "

"221" "Spang" 2014-06-18 " this idea that by killing her hell some how step over the line seems to presuppose hes living in a modern time reading the guardian while pondering the moral certainties of life i guess he should have just reported shae to the authorities who would have had her done for purgury told his story to the press and all would have been well with the world while there are many bits of got that doesnt ring at all true its rings true in that people use what they have to use to get what they want and bad things happen to people regardless of their underlying worthiness or morals men use physical strength women use sex the rich use money royals use bloodline and everyone gets screwed i see tyrions act of killing shae and his father not as something which steps him over the line into evil but as him recognising that his life as he has known it has come to an end he gave everything for this woman and she betrayed him seemingly as if he was nothing now maybe the tragedy was that she had no choice but the tv didnt portray that so its hard to say that would have made it all the more tragic of course and he knows that killing his father will also remove any protection he has hes basically pushed to a point where hes killing himself as he shoots his father i thought this was portrayed wonderfully as he accepts his fate afterwards in that sort of semicatatonic state that you could fully expect patricide would lead you to "

"234" "HumSci" 2014-06-17 " i disagree shae was always a proud woman and she never saw herself as just a whore she insisted to tyrion over and over that she loved him but he never truly believed her and this hurt her  he wouldnt believe that she was more than a whore remember that she often tried to convince him to leave kings landing with her so they could start new lives together and be equals but he never would i suspect she felt she was more committed to their relationship than he was and then when tyrion tried to send her away for the last time  even though it was for her own safety  it was a final denial of her choice to be with him and to be more than just a whore he even called her a whore for someone as proud as shae i suspect that was straw that broke the camels back her thinking going something along the lines of sod you if even you of all people still think im just a whore i guess thats what ill be thinking on it i see parallels between the tyrionshae and ygrittejon relationships in both cases the women believed that love could trump all other concerns and that their men would sacrifice their earlier loyalties to their families and causes both women were horribly hurt when this didnt happen and lashed out in the ways they knew best lastly tyrion took massive exception to his father calling shae a whore of course she was much more than a whore to him but i suspect the strength of his reaction to the word had something to do with that fact that he remembered belittling her the same way and wondering if this precipitated her betrayal "

"250" "jkovac" 2014-06-17 " great comment this is exactly how i felt about these things the fight between brienne and the hound made no sense arya suddenly acted out of character as we have known her and her relationship to the hound so far by leaving him to die but the most dissapointing and hollow ringing was the whole tywin tyrion shae story arc it is not plausible that the cunning and fiercely intelligent tywin would believe that tyrion has killed joffrey and if he did not believe that to be true then why did he go through that whole charade of having him arrested and tried and if tyrion did not kill joffrey then who has why was tywin not interested in that yes tywin treated tyrion harshly but not more so than cersei actually throughout the whole series one had the impression that they actually respected each other on some fundamental level tyrion killing tywin made no sense at all as did tywin bedding shae surely there must have been other maybe even better looking whores in kings landing tyrion knows that without tywin he is nothing just another dwarf and murderer all the major events and deaths in the series so far happened for reasons that were in tune with the characters of the protagonists we understood why ned died and why the red wedding happened and why oberyn died and ser roderick and others but tyrion murdering his father and arya leaving the hound to die was just lazy writing quite dissapointing really hope this is not a sign of things to come as the series writers take over the story and deviate more and more from the books and the whole ice zombies sequence was really crappy and unecessary it was there only to kill jojen "
"251" "pipdog" 2014-06-17 " however i agree with you that brienne beating the hound seemed more than a little implausible "
"252" "pipdog" 2014-06-17 " you seem to believe that if the characters dont behave as you expect them to behave then the fault lies with the storytelling rather than with you but the fact is that people act in all sorts of unaccountable ways human behaviour doesnt run along some singleline track as you seem to apply grrm made tywins death part of his narrative if you dont like it why not go off and write your own fantasy adventure "
"253" "Janel Jones" 2014-06-17 " i see what you mean about cersei  she did actually seem to believe her instant intuition that tyrion poisoned joffrey which is surely a path to madness id like to see her locked in a padded cell ranting where noone could hear her tywin is cleverer with his intuitions but still refuses to accept uncomfortable truths such as the incest that created the heirs to the throne but he needed to keep one of his children onside and has failed miserably at that how can he rule a kingdom if he cant keep his kids in line "

"257" "jkovac" 2014-06-17 " i could not disagree more with this review and some of the explanations for the behaviour of the characters in this episode the whole episode felt hollow it was probably the worst episode of the whole series so far hopefully not a game changer in negative sense as opposed to episode 9 of series 1 which really caught everybodys attention  we realized then than this is not going to be storytelling as we were used to from other books tv dramas movies episode 10 started well enough with the events at the wall followed by the scenes at daenerys court but everything afterwards felt contrived leaving aside the crap scene with the ice skeletons that looked liked it came from a much cheaper movie  why on earth did brienne and the hound fight so bitterly for no good reason at all really just because the writers wanted it so and although brienne is a formidable fighter still it seems implausible that she would better the hound and why did arya leave the hound to die she has already saved him once and since then they have only become better pals if anything he has never done anything bad to her or her sister or anybody except maybe the butchers boy quite the opposite it did not make sense it was out of her character as we have known it for almost 4 seasons and most dissapointingly the whole arc of the tywin and tyrion story seemed to make no sense in series 4 it is not plausible that the cunning and fiercely intelligent tywin would believe that tyrion has killed joffrey and if he did not believe that to be true than why did he go through that whole charade of having him arrested and tried and if tyrion did not kill joffrey then who has why was tywin not interested in that yes tywin treated tyrion harshly but not more so than cersei actually throughout the whole series one had the impression that they actually respected each other on some fundamental level tyrion killing tywin made no sense at all as did tywin bedding shae surely there must have been other maybe even better looking whores in kings landing tyrion knows that without tywin he is nothing just another dwarf and murderer all the major events and deaths in the series so far happened for reasons that were in tune with the characters of the protagonists we understood why ned died and why the red wedding happened and why oberyn died and ser roderick and others but tyrion murdering his father and arya leaving the hound to die was just lazy writing quite dissapointing really "
"258" "madpete" 2014-06-17 " to be honest i was a little disappointed in this episode why is there the need to tie up all the loose ends it felt like a star trek next gen episode you know where they spend 40 minutes building the plot and 5 minutes solving the problem and then head off into the darkness i think its been done tieing up loose ends because the american audience cannot deal with a drawn out plot unfortunately for everyone else it means that we have the feeling that someone has gone down a bullet list and ticked off each plot line i felt pretty cheated and not only that deflated especially after the big build up that this episode had been given by the producers and by the guardian there was a feel of oh and we had better and it seemed as story lines were closed just for the sake of it i also agree that a longer season would have helped with this awful squeeze everything into one episode "
"259" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-06-17 " i can understand your point of view when someone accidentally reveals that a certain character is alive in later books it is a bit irritating but i can forgive it but its people that say things like youve mentioned above ironic its on fathers day and many other things theres no need to give stuff away like that they must assume that other people are complete morons to not put 2 and 2 together if someone revealed to me in a conversation something massive i would also get annoyed its not asking much for people to simply refrain from intentionally dropping clues "

"261" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " just because someone says killing him would be a mercy doesnt mean it is true or necessarily the best thing to do and it sure doesnt make it easy even if it would be the best thing to do i dont think anyone would think anything of it if arya s mother or father asked for the same thing and she was unable to do it "
"262" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " i suspect it seemed difficult to maintain the same relationship in part because she was older in the show it just wouldnt have been believable  her responses to people and situations are very much those of a younger child but i dont find it hard to think she have difficulty killing someone she cared about shes become quite cool on the outside at least and has killed enemies but shes never had to do something like that with someone she cares about "
"263" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " its really no different than a conversation with a bunch of people and you have to think of it that way for whatever reason if people make a tv series or miniseries or film about a classic book people do not expect that they will avoid clues when reading or talking to people or even in older but modern fiction who would expect to go see a new movie version of one flew over the cuckoos nest as if it were an new and unknown story the kinds of spoilers like ironic it is on fathers day are a bit silly and easy enough to avoid but in the end probably inevitable you will get some but other times people object to things like indications a particular character may be alive in a later book and that sort of thing is not only almost impossible to prevent but you are putting a real burden on other people asking them not to talk about them i think that is someone gets their enjoyment substantially ruined if everything is not a complete surprise they are pretty much going to have to totally avoid any discussion at all "

"266" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " the extra motivation provided in the book makes not just that moment but the assassination of tywin as well as tyrions farewell to jaime much more layered and psychological it also provides a dark emotional core to tyrions future arc i think this is true instead of being just about recent events it ties everything to his first marriage which is the event which seems to have most defined his entire life and selfimage after that there is really no wondering why he reacts the way he does it seems totally natural "
"267" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " tywin has a pathological hatred of prostitutes because he believes one made his father and therefore his family by which i mean himself a laughing stock he thinks tyrion makes his family  by which i gain mean tywin  a laughing stock and the fact that he publicly uses prostitutes makes it worse and even more risible and so tywin hates it even more "
"268" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " i mostly didnt like her either but i dont know that i have to she isnt a particularly bad person shes obviously quite bright and likes people but i find her feelings of entitlement annoying at times but then i think that will be part of her story too "
"269" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " i think it is clear that varys links what stannis is involved with with that kind of practice of blood magic that seems reasonable it certainly seems to involve a lot of blood so far we dont really know what makes blood magic really work though it seems to relate to some sort of demonic forces i personally tend to think that rhollor isnt a god at all in the developed sense of the term but instead is a demon who has managed to acquire a sort of cult following by claiming to be more than he is im just not sure what his goal is though i tend to think it is very similar to littlefingers "
"270" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " he might have stayed there they really dont say for sure but it seems like it would be a dangerous choice going to see illariyo seems likely to me we know they were in contact and ships went between them regularly no reason he couldnt come back to kl at a later date if required "
"271" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " id point out though that we dont really know that in the show  we dont get much information about what sorts of things hes done he was going to kill the farmer with the wagon before arya stopped him though the book makes it quite clear that he has done such things and hes unromantic about it being part of his job description  he tells sansa in one of his attempts to scare the crap out of her that he has killed fighting men and old men in their beds and rich men and poor and women and children too "
"272" "Strangegoldfish" 2014-06-17 " there are wars all the time now and they are just as dubiously justified but its because they need to be justified and authorised and sanctified that we know people know theyre wrong they might still do terrible things but they know they shouldnt before christianity and moses and and solomon and hammurabi and whoever the guy was before that some sumerian i guess there was right and wrong and people trying to think of ways to exempt themself from feeling guilty even slavery many slave owners tried to exonerate themselves thats where the whole black people are only 58th the soul of white people nonsense came from but i do see your point i really do the world of got if its to be really enjoyed as a riff of the realities of medieval history cant be held to a modern moral sensibility but even so there is a moral good and bad if not a black and white after all how many times has tyrion defended someone who is a victim or weaker or smaller i think thats why so many people are shocked and want to defend what he did because if tyrion about the closest to a moral representative as we the viewers have to invest ourselves in can do something so terrible well were all of us at sea no anyway fun to chat with you now we only have to wait an eon until the next season "
"273" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " are you saying that arya did not put him out of his misery cause she cared i am not sure i can see it that way though the book may provide more here she didnt act in a way that someone who is sympethatic but unable would she simply robbed a injured man and left him to suffer the book is quite different and not really comparable  their relationship seems to develop quite differently they remain hostile to each other  or at least arya is hostile though perhaps confused about her feelings she is younger and sees things in a more black and white way and she never knew and doesnt discover anything about how sandor got to be who he is sandor is kind enough to her in his way which is the way a largely dysfunctional alcoholic who was abused as a child would be but she isnt able to see that when she leaves him she has almost immediately forgotten him and certainly hasnt forgiven him whether she is being cruel or just totally indifferent isnt clear what i think is similar is that she is in a sense very emotionally detached except from her immediately family  shes become used to seeing people to come into her life and out of it and she has learned how to move on in the show they seem to have come to a very different place she heard his story was clearly moved by it offered of her own volition to help him with his wound since then hes ceased to be her captor and become her companion and i think she has responded to that as much as she is able i think if he was still on her list shes kill him not leave him just to be cruel she didnt do that to anyone else not has she shown much desire to do so even with people who in any view thoroughly deserved it she could have left polliver with his guts out or rorge to die slowly and didnt the old dying man on the other hand was someone she didnt know and it isnt necessarily all that difficult to do something like that for someone in such a situation as far as the hound i think if she had killed him she would never have been sure if it was for mercy or revenge and so she left him and moved on "

"276" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " not at all id say but why would we expect that all characters have equally important roles throughout a long series like this the hound has always been along for the ride in a sense  he has no stake in the politics he doesnt want power he is really a tool of the powerful so we follow his story to some extent by chance where his life intersects what the powerful are doing he also functions to give us a view of how the power games of the nobility affect the people they use to carry them out  he like gregor was created to be what he is and we can see where that has brought him "
"277" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " there is something really awful about the way tywin dismisses her as inconsequential even while she lies dead in his bed "
"278" "Sunburst" 2014-06-17 " but nobody has ever thought killing somebody is fine in say the 14th century a man who murdered a woman for whatever reason still knew what he was doing was wrong are you sure i find these statements very dubious there were wars back then all the time grown men fought in battles all the time killing hundreds and many clearly believed the church that it was perfectly fine to kill someone if he wasnt christian all this of course doesnt mean that i think what tyrion did was good objectively perhaps because there is no objective standpoint from which to evaluate every act ever committed and no objective authority to render judgement all morality and all socialcultural norms are historically contingent only 150 years ago in the industrial western civilization it was considered moral by millions of educated people to own slaves tyrion well his actions have to be judged in context selfdefence heartbrokenness hurt inflicted by shae and tywin despair heat of the moment etc etc i wont say whether what he did is good or bad because it makes no sense to speak in such simple terms hell wrestle with that for the rest of the series ive no doubt about that as is only logical from the logic of the narrative and common sense "

"281" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " i think the answer is in the dialogue tyrion says to varys after he comes out of the tower of the hand i always knew what she was but i never knew what he was and varys says and now you do varys is not surprised doesnt even need to ask what tyrion found or who she is and it is a real revelation for tyrion that his father is something completely different from what he believed him to be tywin has always been a hypocrite the stuff about doing things for the good of the family was always hypocrisy none of that means he doesnt actually believe what he says  that would just make him a liar he is a real hypocrite who believes what he says and somehow rationalizes his actions to himself if you look carefully at his behavior he is doing it constantly not just during the period the novels cover but in the descriptions of the rebellion and his years as hand under the targyrians the descriptions of the time of tyrions birth we hear from oberyn look at how he manages to fail to notice jaime and cerceis relationship even after it had become completely obvious to everyone else or how he failed utterly to understand jaime he comes across as smug and selfcontained and superior and in the know but that is all a creation of his own imagination which he manages to project to other people very effectively "

"287" "ArjabSarkar" 2014-06-17 " i read the word song on this post so i thought of posting this here i realized that it has collectively escaped our minds to appreciate the music on the show    the various renditions of the title track of course but also the adaptations of the songs in the book and the general track especially the ones which accompany long and significant monologues like the one which plays in the background when oberyn announces that he will be tyrions champion    if anything is absolutely perfect on the show    which leaves no space whatsoever for nitpicking id say its the music that track accompanying the above mentioned oberyn scene almost had me wet my pants    and im sure tyrion did wet his but that would be even without the music considering the relief he would feel at that point "

"292" "Amtiskaw" 2014-06-17 " well theyve mentioned his wife early on the show but i dont think its ever been brought up again and we dont have access to his pointofview thoughts about her meaning it would be difficult to suddenly remind the audience of it and have it be the justification for his actions i thought maybe they were planning to have tywin or jamie kill shae given the changes to her character and how brutal an act her murder is by tyrion who is more sympathetic in the show than he is in the books but in the end things played out much as they did on the page it seems like dd are willing to invent and change quite a lot but feel obliged to keep the big moments and major deaths consistent i can understand why but the problem is that the big moments are a usually a culmination of the smaller ones and this approach can result in some inconsistent character arcs i agree that the difference in tyrion and jamies relationship is now problematic in the books his sense of complete betrayal means he swears vengeance against his whole family and most of his subsequent actions are motivated by that but its difficult see why hed do so in the tv show "

"315" "Dangalf" 2014-06-17 " i thought it was the blood magic that varys wa talking about from memory the discussions he had with tyrion about why he needed to defend kings landing against stannis made the link pretty explicit "

"323" "Violator" 2014-06-17 " i always knew that the more overt fantasy elements would begin to become more and more apparent as the story continues effectively it will feel less like a historical drama and somewhat more like classic high fantasy martin has indicated as much too put it this way were highly likely to have a battle involving big fuckoff dragons giants children of the forest mammoths wargs greenseers direwolves white walkers and wights at some point before the final whistle is blown if you loath fantasy then i feel sorry for you but most will be so invested in the story that they will watch it through to the end regardless personally i yelled out when leaf appeared  ive been looking forward to the inclusion of the children since their reappearance in adwd my only disappointment is that she didnt appear to have the large cat eyes that are described they did the right thing though  young child with voice dubbed over by someone who sounds much older  always sounds cool and a bit spooky did in legend too im just not sure how theyre going to stretch this bit out though for 10 episodes  even if they dont appear in every one it will kill the momentum of that storyline if theyre basically stuck in caves under a tree for months it was also a shame that jamie never told tyron the secret that his father had kept from him and the part he had played in it this is a heartbreaking moment in the book and it leaves the brothers in a very different place before their parting compared to where they are in the show loved brienne vs sandor  superb fight scene and an improvement on the book obviously danys story needs beefing up just as the writers have implied they will it really does drop off now and lose all forward pace for what seems like e forever a character who starts off with barely anything and undergoes one of the most obvious developments in characters for four books suddenly becomes really really uninteresting hoping to see more of the crows eye and the iron islands in season 5 but hasnt all that been happening anyway are there any other fantasy creatures that people wouldnt mind seeing making an appearance in the books and the series "

"326" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " yes i think a few people were confused by this "
"327" "Seraca" 2014-06-17 " agree with the attempted redemption story theory this is why i think what arya did was so cruel sandor was slowly softening up and show his vulnerabilities but in the last moment arya showed that the world was really as cruel as sandor had imagined it to be all along are you saying that arya did not put him out of his misery cause she cared i am not sure i can see it that way though the book may provide more here she didnt act in a way that someone who is sympethatic but unable would she simply robbed a injured man and left him to suffer "

"329" "RichTheWriter" 2014-06-17 " tyrions reasons for being in a wild rage are much more clear in the book its hard to understand why the show creators didnt put that in also his relationship with jamie is now different than in the book not sure how theyll explain that "
"330" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " because as arya mentioned last week it had slowed him down considerably accounting for brienne overcoming him when he had faced far worse odds before i dont think arya left him because she was being cold though that happens in the book had she been cold to him she would never in a million years have offered to help him fix up the neck wound a few weeks ago she was clearly very moved by his story she just keeps her emotions buried deep she is a traumatized kid who has learned to just shut down a bit when people leave her "
"331" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-06-17 " i really enjoyed the finale the series is not capturing some characters well enough stannis for one i can agree on this since im a hardcore stannis book fan and i dont like how they are portraying him the series now is diverging well from the book i dont think sothey may cut scenes or add new ones but overall the plot is heading in the exact same direction as the book "

"335" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " hes my favorite as well i could barely watch the fight i thought i was going to be sick much as i felt when i read it actually but you know it makes some sense in terms of his story which is in a way more important than the fact that we love him and want to see him from week to week i would argue that sandors story has essentially been a redemption story or one might say an attempted redemption story depending on your perspective as far as arya i think youve misinterpreted her actions somewhat it is one thing to think when you dont care that it is better to put someone out of his misery and it is another thing to do it yourself when you do "

"346" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " overall the scene in every way made the cercei seduction of jaime in the last episode even more sinister and calculated and hence the rape ecene was superbly done and all the complaints about it shows that one should wait for stories to pan outbut too many people like to jump opn something like that without the context that is an interesting point  it does rather put both those events in a different light "

"394" "Dukered" 2014-06-17 " but shae’s murder represents a line crossed yes you can make a case for an element of selfpreservation and that it was necessary to stop shae raising the alarm good summary as ever but i have to disagre with this when shae saw tyrion she immediately reached for a knife and we can only assume she intended to use it that alone made it self defence never mind the fact that shae would also have raised the alarm either way tyrion would have been killed so he had no choice but to kill her regardless of what his actual motivation was at the time at the very least he should be acquitted on the grounds of diminished responsibility under severe provocation and lets not forget that shae also lied in court in order to get tyrion killed why is revenge against tywin considered ok but revenge against shae is not both tried to kill him  more than once thus both are fair game imotyrion even went to painful extremes to try to save shaes life and she betrayed him in every way possible just because she was too stupid to realise he was protecting her tywin who once again brands shae nothing more than a whore i think shae herself demonstrated that she is little more than that that look melisandre gave him behind the flames was more than a little bit interested for me this was the most intriguing thing that happened in the whole episode mel stared knowingly at arya in season 3 but that scene with jon went much much deeper i think i also like the fact that stannis seemed to have instant respect for jon  and also for mance to a degree bran’s warging into hodder makes me uncomfortable yes he’s saving the day to be fair on this occasion he actually did it to save hodors life as he was overwhelmed by skeletal wights until bran intervened with tywin dead and varys gone does that leave cersei as queen regent in charge and if so should we all be very scared indeed yes and yes although varys doesnt really come into it with tywin gone there is nobody but jaime left to try to control cersei westeros should be very afraid all in all that was one of the best episodes ever the scene with briennearyahound was a welcome surprise for book readers if only brienne had allowed arya to choose what she wanted to do instead of insisting that arya was to go with her that way she might have earned aryas trustit is a shame that the most honorable characters also appear to be the most stupid it should have occurred to brienne that aryasansa would need convincing to go with her youd think she would have given thought as to how she would approach them  what she would say when she found them etc and then losing arya in the middle of the wilderness wasnt clever either she cant have gone that far and where was her horse i dont think we need to worry about jaime freeing tyrioni doubt he is likely to admit to his involvement and with varys out of the picture it seems clear that he will take all the blame its all set up nicely for season 5 only ten months to go  woohoo "

"412" "Alfster" 2014-06-17 " but was he justified in terms of the shows morality the characters have morality  the show itself has no morality  nor should it  it is an adult show written by adults who treat the audience as adults and therefore have the characters doing what they believe they would do in those circumstances for whatever reasons the characters have be it within themselves or for their future unknown to us plans "
"413" "ID0000001" 2014-06-17 " we know tyrion is cynical and a political pragmatist but underneath the wit and oneliners we have clung to the idea that he is essentially good the murder of shae challenges that notion eh when shae was lying in court about their relationship to strengthen the case against tyrion she knew hed likely be sentenced to death if convicted killing someone who tried to get you killed is perfectly normal within the got universe "
"414" "GabrielTheToad" 2014-06-17 " wellpaced hardly they spent too much time at castle black in ep9 so had to squash too much into this episode tyriontywin was particularly rushed and missing a vital revelation the fight with brienne and the hound was better than any of the action at castle black last episode though "

"416" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-17 " ive watched it a second time now and realised i got confused at the first viewing i missed that tyrion turned away from the stairs and went back along the passage i though he went up the stairs and up into tywins room  thereby thinking varys had tricked tyrion into going in there and seeing shae and then killing tywin in anger  ie the whole death of tywin was a manipulation by varys doh might have been quite a good alternative plot though which does still leave me wondering why tyrion went back im not convinced he went back to kill his father and he did seem pretty surprised to see shae there  was it just instinct that drew him back "
"417" "cariboo" 2014-06-17 " i do love stannis harsh but fair "
"418" "cariboo" 2014-06-17 " i think the tv show did well to shorten the whole bran storyline considerably it seems bloody interminable in the books also rather satisfying for brienne to actually bump into a stark girl the series of near misses and just plain wandering around she does in the books gets a bit wearing at times the simplification of peoples characters and motives in the tv show is less welcome but i understand why did they it they way they did mostly "
"419" "discoveryofslood" 2014-06-17 " because i was convinced that she really did love him i guess that is where the difference lies when i read the books it always seemed like she was telling tyrion what he wanted to hear because he was paying her tyrion then created an imaginary romance based on this foundation remember we only see things from tyrions point of view add this to the fact that she didnt betray him until he was already going down and she didnt have another choice and it really feels to me that she was harshly treatedthe number of comments that are like she was a whore so she deserved what she got make me feel quite uneasy tbh "

"421" "Dewulf" 2014-06-17 " wow so much hate for this scene anyone would think this series doesnt already have dragons a girl who cant be hurt by scorching infernos shadow baby assassins giants dead dudes coming back to life that can only be killed with fire and white walkers all of which require you to somewhat trust the writers in the rules theyre establishing for this kind of stuff but since you go into the logistics of the scene i can easily give it the benefit of the doubtthe one child of the forrest we actually saw was able to kill a few skellies yes but it was obvious she wasnt going to be able to handle the increasing numbers coming out of the ground and that was with hodor and co keeping some of them busy  they had to make an escape going out to take on the skellies alone could easily end very badly so that alone is enough to understand it but we could add that the tree is obviously a stronghold against the power of the white walkers  which is obviously strong in the north so even trying to take out the skellies could have bad repercussions for the tree dwellers indeed ok worth the risk to save bran  co not so much otherwise actually ive noticed a lot of people whinging about the fantasy nature of this scene and i wonder if thats not where youre really coming from despite all the supernatural stuff i mentioned above a big chunk of the audience doesnt seem to want the show to go thereand its like well what did you expect i wonder if any of the same people enjoyed the lotr filmswith the amount of money they took in you would think so wouldnt you "

"453" "Sunburst" 2014-06-17 " in medieval europe it was allowed officially sanctioned and even encouraged by both the state and church for christian people to kill people of different religion it was said that you got a free pass to heaven if you killed an infidel it swelled the ranks of the crusader armies not to mention the inquisition a 500yearlong legal and morallyhallowed genocide therefore compared to real medieval europe game of thrones is teletubbies and it amazes me when people watch a show based on such a society and expect the characters to follow the moral code of 21st century liberal democracies its absolutely ridiculous "
"454" "dsk84" 2014-06-17 " that is an interesting point raised part of me seems to think it was just a convenient plot device and not much else could it also be tywin trying to get revenge on tyrion he does still blame him for killing the only woman he ever loved whether rightly or wrongly so its almost as if he isnt willing to let tyrion love either first with the was she or wasnt she a whore and now by effectively reducing shae to a whore in front of tyrion he did seem to think she was something more he probably wouldnt have expected tyrion to catch him with her though he may well have been banging her from around the time of the trial and if he was going to have him shipped off to the wall he might have made sure tyrion saw them together i am just speculating here though "

"498" "SharpMango" 2014-06-17 " well theres a problem here isnt there when one tells a story there should be a narrative element that binds them the fact that historically her family were the rulers of westeros is fair enoughso what are we meant to learn from the danaerys story here was once an exiled child of a king in the west who went to rule on in the east well great but what does that have to do with the rest of the storylinesthere needs to be a better way to tie in danaerys with the rest of the got universe perhaps if she had at least launched an abortive attack a la stannis in season 2 she would have been considered much more central to the plot but right now we see a game of thrones being played with the likes of the tyrells boltons lannisters etc and we see the targaeryans playing a completely different game "

"504" "Dewulf" 2014-06-17 " but dont forget the second sons captured the mereen navy for herthey discussed how many troops they could move  it wouldve been pretty much her entire force so as i understood it from the shows perspective it was questionable which houses if any would support her leaving her with 10000 men not enough to conquer westeros and three adolescent dragonswhich are no where near the armyslaying monsters theyd need to be to make up the shortfall plus she cant control them either last but not least even if she could take the iron throne she could lose it easily through poor leadership once queen  so now while her dragons grow shes taken the opportunity to gain experience as a ruler  something she needs the problem is shes the equivalent of the ussr or the usa occupying afghanistan not an easy learning ground to say the least "

"512" "keef1980" 2014-06-17 " i dont understand why they included the scenes in which sandors wound festered and was foreshadowed to be killing him if they didnt intend on seeing that through as the reason for him ending up being left for deadthat aside the hound and arya have been brilliant and i loved that as she hardened he softened at an equivalent rate until she actually overtook him in coldness by not giving him mercy as he had to the old man they met a few weeks backnot entirely convinced its the last well see of him though im firmly of the if you dont see them die dont assume theyre dead persuasion "

"590" "yealandRed" 2014-06-17 " i think youre making a mistake in judging these characters by todays standards tyrions actions would be well understood in that world and would not be held up to question whether he is essentially good or not i like to view the show in the same way that i view most figures from history as im pretty certain that id be disgusted by a great deal of them for example a straightforward case would be something like churchills antisemitism and defence of empire whereas many admirable nineteenth century people were sexist racist and accepting of class differences to an extent that is unimaginable in our current society "

"628" "kged" 2014-06-17 " i was disappointed by the sequence after jaime broke tyrion out of his cell but not for the reasons others have posted  my objections are more pragmatic id forgotten this but in the books there is a fair amount written about the warren of tunnels under and around the grand rooms of the red keep and how various sneaky types have used them to pick up information over the centuries but i cant recall anything about them in the show correct me if i am wrong so how come tyrion reaches the stairs to freedom and decides to go back and pop out of a trapdoor in the small councils meeting chamber how did he know it was there it seems very unlikely that a man in his situation would just go wandering back into the dungeons on the offchance that he might find such a trapdoor aryas long cold silence in the face of such a powerful man falling apart right before her eyesremarkable the very definition of the thousand yard stare its long been my fanboy creed that tyrion and varys will ultimately be the pivotal players in this game imagine my delight at them setting off on nautical adventures together and of course sarah  thank you ten unmissable blogs again heres to season five being a 52parter "
"629" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " hmm i tend to think that his feelings about her were fairly mixed  sexual attraction isnt necessarily always divorced from a sort of paternal concern in a situation like that and i dont know that the sexual thing was the most important thing he felt but if we are talking about the bedroom scene in the book i think there was a distinct sense that he might well rape her and he threatened to kill her more than once and scared the crap out of her shoving someone down on a bed while you leer over her with a dagger at her throat isnt asking her to sing for you because she seems innocent and beautiful "

"635" "MishkaYaponchik" 2014-06-17 " the show does the books justice but its simply not on the same level a lot of the definitive scenes from the books have been lacking in the show the greatest lines from the books were changed "

"637" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " i dont think its that unusual a view  can you not think of any circumstances where you might decide the best course of action was to murder someone or where you might lose your cool enough to do it in a passion someone who was going to do great evil an abuser who was going to be able to continue his abuse of the innocent someone who pushed you over the edge in the wrong circumstances when you were under great stress or impaired and the means was close at hand im not a particularly aggressive person but i dont have a problem coming up with such a scenario "

"647" "dsk84" 2014-06-17 " it worked fine i never saw the circumstances behind their falling out as a major driving factor for jaime if anything his relationship with his father and sister played as big a part with tyrion yes he was deeply hurt by thlse revelations but he was just as deeply upset by seeing shae sleeping with her father and him killing her it also plays against aryas departure from the hound as two coldantagonistic separations would have been a bit much "

"653" "discoveryofslood" 2014-06-17 " this isnt the place to discuss this properly unfortunately wait why not the show is an adaption of a series of novels and it seems silly to ignore this fact if we dont provide spoilers for future show events whats the problem i assume anyone watching a show based on books they havent read doesnt really mind having details from the books shared murder as opposed to say a clash in battle remains murder and theres never really any justification its not really about justification though its about characterisation the extra motivation provided in the book makes not just that moment but the assassination of tywin as well as tyrions farewell to jaime much more layered and psychological it also provides a dark emotional core to tyrions future arc it seems a shame to have binned this in favour of ten minutes of brienne and sandor hitting each other "

"659" "nickc909" 2014-06-17 " a very good end to a very good series im always a little irritated that dany and her interpreter sound exactly the same and often their scenes are done in wide shots so hard to see who is actually talking "
"660" "eyedropper" 2014-06-17 " and the scenes with old lady tyrell flirting like a ol fox at the golf club but then brutal when he threatens to have her son popped into the kings guard for being a sword swallower through and through "

"669" "dumbwit" 2014-06-17 " just did not buy the whole scene with tyrion and how his character reacted in the past but he has helped his sister by killing his father which would not please him it might be dramatically pleasing to some but it stretched credulity varrys manipulations finally exposed or at least implicated and he has had to get out of town another bloody fight scene this time with the hound and brienne and as usual the before and after is more interesting than the actual fight after a long winded lead in to the battle in the north during this series the best scenes in this episode happened there with brans journey and stanis arrival khaleesi collared two of the dragons for another ho hum excerpt from mereen unlike the banishment of jorah it seems that there will be no winterfell reunion for a long time yet with the surviving siblings like the third series once again probably two or three stand out episodes but not at the same level of the first two series "

"672" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-17 " what i meant is that tywin seems to be quite capable of inventing his own narrative and believing it he believed that his family was a particular way he told himself that he was justified in what he was doing to tyrion depite all his blather about families he believed that tyrion was responsible for killing his wife of course tywin is the one who impregnated her he really seems to believe his blather about whores though we see that he hasnt balked at being intimate with them he tells himself he sees things as they really are when he dismisses the threats from the north and the dragons despite more and more indications that they might be serious cercei similarly seems to really believe the politically or personally expedient stories she concocts tyrion does it to an extent  maybe more in the book where he tells himself shae really loves him but much less i think that either cercei or tywin perhaps because he has always been forced to see himself in a more critical light "

"717" "Suido9" 2014-06-16 " this season has confirmed this for me too the tv version has better editing than the book version simple as that as an authors fame increases editorial control decreases and the likelihood of selfimportant longwinded writing and bloated storylines increases the most famous version of this would be the massive increase in size and scope of the potter books after prisoner of azkaban which coincided with worldwide fame turn those books into a tv or movie however where theres so much more cost associated with each new character and extra line of dialogue and suddenly editorial control increases rarely for the better because it takes exceptional editing and writing to convert a story from one medium to another but in this case its been done brilliantly "
"718" "Thisusernameistaken7" 2014-06-16 " im seconding the hound loved sansa theory when he talks about how he should have raped her what he actually did was ask her to sing for him she sang and he cried hes cynical about everything he thinks the world is an awful cruel place and hes right but sansa moved him she was the only innocent and beautiful thing in his life i think he cried for his horrible existence for the knowledge that everything gentle and fragile gets stomped on destroyed and that he is one of the people doing the stomping he loved her but not necessarily in a sexual way "

"772" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-16 " tywin sleeping with shae wtf something thats bothered me since reading it in the books  and now bothers me having seen it on screen  is tywins apparent tryst with shae bothered may not be the right word but i am struggling to understand it tywin outwardly disdains whores and it seems as though he may not have been with any women since his wifes death but now suddenly just before his death tywin is seen with a prostitute well that i can understand  maybe he has just kept his predilections secret but i dont believe that because why was he with shae of all people i think that tywin has always seen much more of himself in tyrion than he was able to admit i think that tywin was with shae because he was trying to figure out what tyrion saw in her he knew that tyrion had been with many many whores but he wanted to know why tyrion was in love with this particular whore more importantly he wanted to know if tyrion could fall in love with shae then could he its not that tywin and shae could have ever lived happily ever after tywin may have dismissed her after satisfying his curiosity and he certainly could have never allowed himself a publiclyknown relationship with her but i think that following his wifes death there was a hole in his life that he never knew how to fill and so he looked to tyrions love his whore to explore what was missing and i think that shae simply being in that room speaks more to tywins acknowledgment that tyrion is his true son than anything that tywin couldve spoken aloud "

"807" "DiamondDag" 2014-06-16 " first off thanks again for doing this blog sarah its always a great read and you have the patience of a saint to come down here and put up with us lot as for the finale well i loved the first half second half not so much jon finally feels like the character i know and love im already looking forward to next season for how things play out between him and stannis its a shame stannis big moment kind of lost a lot of its impact by being moved from last episode but never mind more stannis next season please worth giving credit to ciarán hinds too for the way he makes you interested in what mance has to say in such a short amount of time and imbues him with dignity qyburn was damn creepy that was a nice little scene dany locking up viserion and rhaegal was beautifully shot but then on to that second half first up i dont like what theyve done to arya really dont like it theyve had her character down perfectly for nearly 4 seasons but theyre bleeding the life out of her shes too cold arya should have more fire more fear not this stone faced killer look feels cheap and the whole fight between the hound and brienne felt like the worst kind of fan service i worry that theyll keep forcing things like that also a few changes make me fearful im having the book spoiled for me but i cant imagine ill get much sympathy over that is jojen dead now because they know he doesnt figure later on i just feel sorry for him going out in the middle of that subdd nonsense the less said about all of that the better really anyway that was a bit of a come down after last weeks excellent episode for me this season has been very uneven but held together by the outstanding cast and some great individual moments i think i will have to temper my expectations next year "
"808" "DolleDolf" 2014-06-16 " i looked in wikipedia for the ongoing storylines it makes for much more relaxed viewing you miss a lot of the at times confusing and downright discombobulated storylines if you get excited in front of the tv the lady of the manor bought a boxset of the books but i just cant get through them to time consuming wikipedia is a nice quick alternative if you want the suspense of being surprised by the tv action and dont want spoilers i suggest you dont visit a site like this at all after all the books have been out the story has been told "
"809" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-16 " i dont think well have to worry about book spoilers from next season onwards itll be the other way round indeed ive read books one through four but not book five so for me there was at least one big spoiler "

"855" "Janel Jones" 2014-06-16 " i think the killing of tywin can be considered selfdefence since tywin clearly empowered cerseis denunciation and rigged the trial if tyrion were ever to be rehabilitated tywin couldnt be there in a way tyrion has freed his family from tywins grip  though maybe without his machiavellian skills it will have problems remaining in power "
"856" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-06-16 " yeh youre probably right but its a shame because i enjoy these comment pages for the most part it is generally pretty well moderated to be fair to sarah and the other mods but just a few careless comments can give away massive amounts of info i knew before this episode that tywin was going to die on the toilet that stannis was going to arrive at the wall that tyrion was going to escape and i know several things that are going to happen in the near future "

"876" "ashleyhunter" 2014-06-16 " while i thought this was the strongest season finale since the first i still feel like there were a lot of problems with build up which meant a lot of the scenes didnt have the emotional impact they should have tyrions scene with shae and tywin was excellent but jamies freeing of him sort of came out of nowhere i really think episode 9 of this shouldve been the mountain and the viper joffreys murder tyrions trial the trial by combat and then tyrions escape wouldve been a nice consistent season arc which there hasnt really been since season 1 yes its all there but it kept losing momentum it looks like things are going to focus on dany next season with michael huisman being made a series regulari think her scene this week couldve been left to be part of her story next season and we couldve left her at the point she dismisses jorah i think the writers almost feel obliged to have dragons in the finale but we didnt need that scene they couldve set up tyrions scenes better the fight scenes were all excellent and i thought the skeleton fight was a nice nod to ray harryhausen i do wonder what theyre going to do with brans story next season though i am now going to mention the books after this moment in the books he only has one or two more chapters i really hope grrm drops the winds of winter before then because i dont want the show going further than the books "

"881" "bleudegex" 2014-06-16 " a fantastic episode from start to finish i even loved the ice skeletons these zombie attack scenes are always creepier when they happen in the day time i think episodes 9 and 10 really raised the bar in what was a slightly but only slightly disappointing season im a bit disappointed that so many people seem to be defending tyrions actions its the same thing that happened with jaime earlier in the season lets face it  jaime is a rapist and tyrion violently murdered the woman he loved it doesnt you cant still like them as characters but you shouldnt pretend they havent done inexcusable things i have one little criticism  what was going on with yara this season at the end of season 3 she makes that big speech about saving her brother which she tries to do gives up straight away and then we dont see her again why not just leave here out of this season altogether secondly i presume varys and tyrion are going across the narrow sea but what then i can see a meeting with jorah happening at some point but are they going to try and join danys side varys was responsible for trying to kill dany but i can still see him and tyrion trying to worm their way into danys inner circle and it would make the meereen storyline a hell of a lot more interesting "

"884" "keepithuman" 2014-06-16 " tyrions killing of shae could be justified in court as self defence and it really cost him such a sad scene where he says sorry to her corpse not so the killing of tywin in no way can this be justified he brought the crossbow reloader and fired a second bolt into his dad and his state was cold and controlled he definitely wanted to kill tywin and he justified it by sayingyes i am your son because he knew that tywin meant to kill him tyrion is a sympathetic character but he is also a member of the aristocracy and has desires for power just like his sister and father and now hes a fatherkiller we must all adjust our views of tyrion from this moment on "

"899" "Fulton" 2014-06-16 " i feel like i wanted more build up to tywin getting killed it was a bit like tyrion got out of his cell and then just popped up to his dads apartment for a quick chat before leaving a bit more sneaking around and tension in the escape attempt would have been nice i always feel like the problem with got is because they have so many characters and plot lines to often things get compressed down to a few brief scenes i suppose its a sign of quality if you want a bit more length to it mind you i also dont know what theyre going to do next season having killed off so many key characters this time around its going to be like a halfshow reboot quite challenging "
"900" "Chillingworth" 2014-06-16 " thanks for the instructions as to how to appreciate the story properly im well aware that it is two versions of the same story as i said im interested in the changes that are made and why they are being made so in that respect i dont see the show as completely separate the tv series can and should be open to criticism but on its own merits i can just no longer be bothered reading about how benihoff and weiss have completely ruined the series by not including this specific scene that minor character or some tiny piece of back story or dialogue its tedious and in the vast majority of cases not merited some of the criticism ive read about the finale had been ridiculous id much rather enjoy the show for what it is rather than constantly worrying about what its not doing "
"901" "Rich1991" 2014-06-16 " yeah from what i know of the books he does have reasons and onwards trouble with varys beyond this point is that hes part of a pretty colossal spoiler so i cant discuss it at all really "
"902" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-16 " well been a great season ep 9 was the highlight for me but this was still a strong episode overall altho a few things concern me i know stannis said something in s3 about going to the wall but i had forgotten and there was no mention of it this season and then stannis turns up by surprise which i guess was the idea of the writersexcept some people on this blog spoiled it last week by mentioning he was going to turn up  so there was no effing surpise when he did  i complained at the time about spoilers but was ignored plus also that stupid article published early monday morning that i glanced at on my phone also spoiled the tywin surprise so really the guardian managed to reduce the effectiveness of this last episode for me happily there were a few other surprises that helped  like bran getting to the tree however as far as stannis goes i dont really understand his motivation for going to the wall and the actual practicalities maybe season 5 will go into this but im not sure who is going to be grateful to stannis for doing it is stannis a true selfless hero and proper king for his actions "

"914" "EnglishMike" 2014-06-16 " she suddenly felt very insecure and got jealous and wanted to kill tyrion sorry this makes no sense to me jealous i dont see how you can read that into the scene shes suddenly being confronted by the man she condemned to death by her betrayal and says tywin my lion before she realizes who he is  yet another betrayal  and quite understandably assumes that hes there to kill her and goes for the knife to defend herself after all what other reason would a man who is supposed to be being prepped for execution be sneaking around in the bedchamber of the most powerful man in the seven kingdoms perfectly understandable to me "

"919" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-16 " i think for the character actually committing murder as opposed to say ordering it for political reasons is crossing a line tyrion unlike most of his family is neither sociopath nor psycho he feels guilt and regardless of whether shay deserved it and im a wishy washy former convent girl who tends to believe no one actually deserves to be murdered her death will i think haunt him "

"928" "Strangegoldfish" 2014-06-16 " youre upset ive upset you sorry i would only say theres not that much to get upset about these are fictional characters and nobody actually died as for the show tyrion knocked the knife out of her hand she was unarmed and had resorted to slapping him yes there was a definite danger she might call out for help and then our recently escaped hero would be in real trouble keep in mind however tyrion having been freed from his cell rather than escape as instructed deliberately crawled through a secret door into his fathers room with a crossbow presumably not to have a conversation all im saying is while we may stand or sit at our tvs and defend tyrions actions the look on his face made it pretty clear he was not rationalising anything to make himself look better "

"944" "MsEnvelop" 2014-06-16 " it was a great episode and i am looking forward to watching s5 and reading sarahs wonderful blog in general it was a very good season but i agree with sarah that there were some issues that need consideration 1 the awkward raperough sex scene between j and c 2 bran and co at casters keep a total filler no contribution to the character development of story line it felt cheap 3 from seasons 13 shae has been a powerful smart dedicated character she suddenly felt very insecure and got jealous and wanted to kill tyrion sorry this makes no sense to me 4 e9 the battle at the black castle was beautifully done but an observation they had only 104 people in the castle but it felt that only tormund ygritte and styr killed at least 100 each mathematically it is not very convincing 5question how did stannis take all his army from home to beyond the wall without being noticed with ships what is that dday at normandy 6what happened to the mammoths giants thens and many others in mances army dispersed killed captured it was an epic scene but felt a bit rushed tyrion killing his father was a very powerful scene tyrion burnt indeed all the bridges too bad it was the fathers day yesterday felt very strange "
"945" "cajking" 2014-06-16 " that was definitely tywins chamber with shae in tywins bed as far as tyrion knew shae had saved herself by testifying against him and didnt need rescuing tyrions murder was an act of desperation rather than selfdefense he could have just sneaked past without waking her but it doesnt necessarily make him an unsympathetic character by taking shae into his bed tywin had been proving a point that only a whore would be willing to be intimate with tyrion that he was unworthy of any genuine love so tyrions crime is a manifestation of the anguish he feels at seeing his father proved right and in the book this is reinforced by the hope provoked by jaimes revelation just before that his father was wrong about his firstlove tysha by whoring herself out to tywin shae had wounded tyrion more than any blade could shed negated his status as a person worthy of any kind of love and that is why he killed her of course we could and should call tyrions judgement into question here since i felt it was obvious long before that any love in the relationship between tyrion and shae was completely onesided but if tyrions guilty of anything its of being too desperate for someone to love i think thats a fault that many people share "
"946" "corkincali" 2014-06-16 " indeed what choice did he have should they have had a cup of tea and talked about it like mature adults it is possible that if she hadnt woken and asked for her lion he might have tip toed around her and taken care of tywin leaving her to deal with consequences of her actions however once she saw him one of them was going to have to die he knew that the reason why he is such a player in this series is that he doesnt shirk from the real dirty stuff when it has to be done his tactics for the battle of blackwater werent exactly geneva convention contrast that with jonygritte last week she hesitated and it was jon burning her the following episode "
"947" "aethernaut" 2014-06-16 " a great character im gonna miss him "
"948" "DeafPanache" 2014-06-16 " up until the point where tyrion confronts shae in this episode youd only feel sympathy for her having fallen for tyrion and it seemed genuinely loving him back the break up her hit her hard shae being the fiery passionate type wanted revenge for tyrions dismissal of her she knew him and she knew how to hurt him she sought out his gravest enemy cersei i still think shae loved him to this point but love can quickly turn to bitter hatred when betrayal occurs this was exactly the case with jon and ygritte ygrittes arrows were the exact same as shaes lies however when the meet for the last time the two relationships ended very differently the final scene with ygritte and jon together was between lovers who had been torn apart by things out of their control yet they still looked across at each other gazing at each other like young lovers until one their lives was ended prematurely shae on the other hand was a disgrace tyrion finds her naked in his fathers bed the man who tormented bullied and belittled him all his life she calls out tywins name fell of desire ignorant to the fact that it was her former lover footsteps that she heard not tywins they battle almost comically until tyrion gains control and strangles her i think the reason why tyrion says sorry is because he feels responsible for what she did to him he brought her into his conflicted family and she suffered as a consequence i think it pains tyrion to hear it but she was just a whore as tywin puts it shae deserved to die in the end as she was a careless fool "

"956" "ArjabSarkar" 2014-06-16 " a wonderful finale absolutely loved the last scene but my favourite was when varys quietly goes and sits beside tyrions box i was heartbroken when he had seemingly turned against tyrion a brilliant couple they make remember the scene where they talk on a sunny terrace prior to the battle of blackwater in season 2 absolutely wonderful conversation looking forward to more of those in season 5 hopefully especially now that the hound and arya wont be coupling up any longer on another note a big thank you to sarah for this wonderful blog as many have already remarked previously the episodes only end after a reading of this page which includes the comments section of course overall its been a lovely experience barring that one eye popping scene i shall go be a white walker now until the start of next season "

"967" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-16 " yes i agree about the supernatural elements people often mention that there are themes relating to people being mixed or never totally good i think that is a bit of a surface level analysis but fair enough as far as it goes buut all of that stuff and the political intrigue is connected to the supernatural elements which are about that good and evil in a larger or higher sense the question of whether say tyrion or dany will allow good or evil to dominate them or become like stannis or beric in thrall to something which they believe is good but is actually evil whether littlefinger will manage to eat the whole world like the ww do or someone like hound was able in the end to overcome the things that stopped him from being good or was consumed by them these questions are all part and parcel of what will happen with the religious and supernatural element of the story and since it is written that way i dont think well really be able to understand those mundane elements without the supernatural elements we dont just get to see good and evil as played out in characters or conflicts but what is at stake in a larger sense "

"992" "Stuart Duncan" 2014-06-16 " i imagine that now tywins gone jamie as his son could argue he has the right to be in charge it is the boy who is in line for the throne though and there will presumably be a struggle between marjory and cersei for influence over him im a bit suspicious of the rekindling of cerseis passion for jamie is she just attempting to have as much influence as possible "

"994" "DiddleyDum" 2014-06-16 " a fitting end to a decent season i thought with pretty much everyones storylines moved on im interested in the comments above re the supernatural elements of the story without spoiling from the books this is an element which has been there since season 1 when it was commented that magic seemed to be working better now that there are dragons in the world this ties to the one major theme in the books which has been largely discarded  the religions of westeros and how they slot into place with the various families dragons and magic wargs and the rest will i think be as important to the final denouement as buttocks boobs and brutality thanks to sarah for her weekly updates for ten weeks my monday morning routine has been to download watch and then come here to see what is being said heres to season 5 "
"995" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-16 " in the book he is just gone we dont know if he goes by ship or some other way i think he just thinks there is a good chance he will be under suspicion jaime at least knows he played a role and does he trust jaime i am pretty sure that a dead father wasnt part of jaimes plan and he might give him up or cercei might get enough out of jaime to put it together "

"997" "Chivanova" 2014-06-16 " that was great i got a lump in my throat when the ships captain saw her iron coin and responded with valar dohaeris its past time she escaped the cauldron of despair and death that seems to be the westeros countryside still shame to see the hound apparently left for dead rory mccann has been brilliant in the role overall the season has been excellent but perhaps no the series best it almost seemed like a cavalcade of astonishing individual plot points that perhaps do not come together as cohesively as previous seasons many people seem worried that from now on there isnt a clear path through the books and that got may simply come apart at the seams under the weight of all these stories personally im optimistic i think that if the writers are clever there is scope to let the story breathe over the next couple of seasons instead of advancing the plot so relentlessly as has been the case in seasons 3  4 plenty of great stuff happens at the wall mereen dorne braavos kl etc etc "

"1004" "CentralBelter" 2014-06-16 " my favourite charles dance moments havent been his turn as the stern defender of the family though he did that very convincingly but the times when he tried to show some kind of human side like the doubleedged conversations with arya when he didnt know who she was or his barely suppressed exasperation at joffreys antics my vote for the best though his attempt at giving young tommyn the birds and bees talk over joffreys corpse genuinely funny and seemingly warm and humane until you realised how manipulative it all was his performance was one of the highlights of the last 4 seasons for me "
"1005" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-06-16 " i thought jojen warged into one of those skeleton zombie creatures to stab himself and persuade the others to go on without him no maybe i just misunderstood the scene there were a lot of things to pay close attention to this episode even more so than usual "

"1009" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-16 " oh i agree that was a shock after that i think there was very little chance his father wasnt going to end up dead as well an i also am not shocked that he killed her  most people are capable of that sort of thing under the right circumstances "

"1011" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-16 " but the marriage was unconsumated and he died on the wedding day so my presumption and it is a presumption is that cersei will as queen mother assume the role of queen regent and rule in her underage sons place because margaery is yet to marry tommen and may not now tywins dead margarey is actually in rather an awkward position i would say  shes not really the queen any more and she hasnt yet got tommen where she needs him "
"1012" "aphrsk" 2014-06-16 " at first i didnt quite get why he would leave kings landing cant remember if this was explained in the books surely he made sure that no one suspected him of organizing tyrions escape so why would they suddenly suspect him only because tywin gets murdered but then i remembered this scene from season 3 when varys talks to littlefinger in the throne room about the nature of chaos for littlefinger chaos was a ladder but for varys it was a gaping pit waiting to swallow us all i think that when he hears the bells he predicts the incoming chaos and decides not to take his chances he also looks a bit like hes given up once again the plans to bring some stability to the kingdom shattered "

"1016" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-16 " with regards to brans story its interesting that they havent mentioned that among the wildlings warging into a person is rather taboo i think its natural we find it a bit disturbing i wonder whether it was clear to tv viewers that the guy in the tree was actually part of the tree "

"1019" "Stuart Duncan" 2014-06-16 " perhaps but why did he go to see her at all his attitude was one of somebody bent on revenge i thought she was not an impediment to him escaping and a case could be made to the effect that she went at him with a knife in an act of selfdefense and selfpreservation "
"1020" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2014-06-16 " agree with all that my suspicion is that the wall will be front and centre during series 5 looking at the casting for series 5 it looks like kl will be a major part as well although perhaps less klcentric as previously "

"1022" "DiddleyDum" 2014-06-16 " i tend the other way  i thought the last book possibly last two books waswere seriously bloated and the show is doing a decent job of tightening things up i also wonder sometimes if some of the changes in the show are things grrm would do were he able to go back and fix some of his own story lines "

"1026" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-16 " i think it makes more sense if you look at the distances involved though i think there is also an element of the various bits being covered in a week not totally matching up arya did get places but she pretty much marched back and forth around the riverlands for ages often retracing her own steps and then into the vale again getting someplace but it not mattering and in difficult terrain and often she was walking or by mule train near the beginning bran and his lot are on foot in foothills and forest evading capture and the north is as big as the other size kingdoms combined dany is traveling with an army of released slaves while mance was in the mountains gathering all the wildlings including their families and goods  before he even began to move stannis on the other hand is on dragonstone which is not far from either bravos nor from east watch the seafort on that side of the wall and he is traveling by ship which is far swifter than either horse or foot "

"1028" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-06-16 " have loved these blogs thanks sarah and most of the comments on here but a lot of that last episode i knew what was coming due to people giving away what they might call halfspoilers using initials and just generally assuming others arent intelligent enough to decipher blatant clues "
"1029" "Aelfwine" 2014-06-16 " shae in the show really isnt the same person as in the book im convinced she did love tyrion in the show and i thought it was disappointing we never truly knew why she ended up betraying tyrion and sansa  whether it was because she was still angry at him or because tywin and cersei threatened her i know things were different in the books but with shae turned into a more sympathetic character in love with tyrion protecting sansa i would have liked more insight into her motivations "
"1030" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-16 " because it would be ridiculous to write a season final blog that failed to take into account the bits the show got wrong it wasnt a perfect season there were pacing issues and that scene in particular was one of the more unnecessary changes from book to show it is a little boring to have to explain this again but i personally am not objecting to the rape or indeed to the idea of rape on a tv show or indeed that particular character committing rape nor am i saying its the most horrible thing on this show im saying that theres an issue when the shows writers think theyve shot a consensual sex scene and most of the viewers disagree i dont think this is a terribly difficult distinction to grasp and yet week after week people think im objecting to the idea of a rape on the tv show when what im objecting to is a badly written and directed scene which added nothing to either character and certainly didnt improve on events in the book "

"1032" "KnifeInsurance" 2014-06-16 " excellent blog random thought tyrion has never struck me as an outandout nice character while hes certainly one of the more moral ones  especially when compared with the hideous lot in kings landing  hes still not averse to extortion intimidation and murder by proxy when the situation calls for it i do agree that killing shae was an outofcharacter moment even so but still something tyrion might be capable of in extremis incidentally i felt he committed both murders with greater confidence and determination in the books apart from that a thoroughly neat and trim and above all entertaining episode none of the omitted plot elements should detract from the narrative  they were either well past their sellby date or can be introduced later without too much confusion the appearance of the newly flush stannis at the wall should put some much needed red bull into that storylines horlicks and it looks to be exciting if ominous times for bran as well dany locking up her dragons was wonderfully shot although given how fast these things grow she really should be hoping theyre dim enough to fall into the same trap more than once briennes encounter with arya and the hound was a personal highlight both for the way it elegantly tied together two seemingly wandering story arcs and the cracking acting on view rory mccanns extended screen time has truly been one of the best things this season  hes been the absolute standout even with the likes of pascal headey dinklage and williams knocking out smashing performances from week to week come to think of it we never did see if there was a maester hiding behind that rock fingers crossed for more of the same next year "

"1036" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-16 " this isnt the place to discuss this properly unfortunately but i dont think the chance has that much of an effect on the story murder as opposed to say a clash in battle remains murder and theres never really any justification "
"1037" "Michael Hall" 2014-06-16 " i know what you mean as a reader of the books i feel that the foreshadowing in the tv series is so obvious as to contain spoilers of what is to come next season itll be worse and potentially spoil beyond where were up to in the books "
"1038" "BoliMiKura" 2014-06-16 " what i am unsure about is how long tywin had been having his way with shae did bron betray tyrion and take shae straight to tywinss parlour or had tywin got to shae well before that "
"1039" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-16 " may i respectfully direct you to this part in the blog book readers i know you probably expected a different ending but let’s not discuss that here thank you "
"1040" "swisschocolate" 2014-06-16 " dunno it always struck me as rather daft  though as i said elsewhere im not a fan of the fantasy elements in the show i much prefer the political shenanigans and that was one of the more out there aspects "

"1042" "crazyfatguy" 2014-06-16 " even in game of thrones murder is always wrong it was fucking selfdefence did you failed to notice the knife she had in her hand not to mention that she already willingly lied at his trial knowing full well that her lies will help to ensure he receives a death sentence the way some of you are going on about this its as if shaes an innocent shes not her multiple acts of betrayal against tyrion  lying at his trial sleeping with his father attempting to kill him  makes her an outright villain this idea that murder is always wrong is nothing more than a false equivalence as if murders committed in self defence should be regarded as the same as the murders committed by jack the ripper or charles manson or that murders in the form of euthanasia or assisted suicide should be regarded as the same thing as a genocide no murder is not always wrong and theres a reason why there are laws throughout this entire world that permit selfdefence as a justification for murder "

"1046" "Seek Annie" 2014-06-16 " the tywinshae shackup really surprised me he has spent the last 4 seasons bleating on about family honour and belittling tyrion pun not overtly intended about his relationship with shae yet he has been having his way with her for a good few weeks  was this just so she would tesify in the trial it occured to me that tywinshae shackup may go back a long way and that tywin sent shae to tyrion in the first place shae turned up just after tywin realised tyrion was not just a drunk whoremonger but a smart tacticion and that he could be trouble tywin would want to keep an eye on tyrion know what he was thinking planning and also have some leverage yeh it all fits even ordering tyrion to get rid of his whore knowing he wouldnt as a blind and shae as sansas maid could keep tabs on her as well shae came very handy to tywin and he would really have to trust her maybe shae wasnt a whore at all wasnt there always a bit of mystery about her background and her accent that it didnt add up and she seemed too smart and classy to be a whore and that explains all that weird overacting jealousy over tyrion and sansa  remember it didnt make sense that someone as cluey and streetwise as shae wouldnt get it huh yep shae was tywins little spy all along i bet cersei knew all along it will be fun to watch for clues when i do my got rewatch to pass the next 10 months "

"1049" "Fanoftheinvisibleman" 2014-06-16 " sorry sarah but it feels like youre clinging to a notion that the good should be good and the same for the bad guys what got has shown consistently is that theres is no black and white in their universe and a hell of a lot more than fifty shades of grey "

"1054" "SomeRandomPerson" 2014-06-16 " i think the show does quiet a few things better than the books and improve upon them i still love the books but the show writers made certain changes for the better especially with juggling the many plot threads and the chronology issue with the book series where book 5 goes back to the ending of book 3 instead of moving the story along which grrm only does in the 2nd part of book 5 and continues book from book 4 as well "
"1055" "FatFrank" 2014-06-16 " id like to agree with all the others about what a great blog this is its the first place i come to after watching an episode ill miss it the guardian at its best thanks sarah "
"1056" "Pacifyx" 2014-06-16 " its definitely not so clear cut in the show you still feel its possible taht she was simply testifiying against him with assurances from tywin that tryion wouldnt be killed in the books shes just a straight lying money hungry whore nothing more she never loved him like the show portrayed "
"1057" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-16 " i think her reasons for leaving the hound are different in the book and show in the book it was revenge in the show i think they were clearly reconciled she tried to help him when he was wounded and sewed up his cut  that is pretty intimate and she didnt have to do it she was i think quite clearly moved by his story about his brother after that she went from being his captive to his traveling companion to someone he was protecting the stuff about the butchers boy and sansa she was in my view totally unaffected by it  she likely believed it but it didnt make her hate him it wasnt new information if anything it made him more pathetic as far as why she then left him  she killed every person she hated and had the opportunity to maybe if she had never hated sandor she would have given him mercy but i dont think she could face having him as a completed part of her list  even if it had been mercy on her part that would have tainted it  his bringing up the butchers boy might have made it even less likely she would do it all of the people she hated and killed before she really didnt know how they got to be who they were even some of her friends like the butchers boy she barely knew what she has perhaps learned from the hound is that people are the way they are because of events which take them there and perhaps if she killed him she would be no different "
"1058" "WhoGivesADamn" 2014-06-16 " tywin had complete contempt for his son but to bed his whore just a small point but a whore  by definition  does not belong to the customer so to speak "
"1059" "Pacifyx" 2014-06-16 " probably the first time got has actually disappointed me as a book reader what they did with the tyrion scene was just awful and honestly i have no idea how they can fix it in the seasons to come  "
"1060" "Pacifyx" 2014-06-16 " interest yet it was by far and away the weakest episode in the history of got as far as conveying the means and dialogues that existed in the books the complete cut of the dialogue of tyrion and jamie pretty much destroys the entire reasons both tyrion and jamie have going forward "
"1061" "DesmondaMaree" 2014-06-16 " stannis and davos two of my very favourite characters i was taken utterly by surprise by their turning up to save the day at the wall and im glad that storyline was obscured so there was no hint they were coming great episode im most looking forward to arya in bravos and to the aftermath at kings landing nine month is it really i cant wait "
"1062" "Pacifyx" 2014-06-16 " god why is guardian still harping on about the silly jamiecersei quasi rape scene of all the horrible thing that goes on in this show that doesnt even rate in the top 10 "

"1064" "guardiansek" 2014-06-16 " as far as stannis hes got the army so i guess its just a case of whoever has the biggest sword makes the rules nice action sequence of stannis army outflanking the wildlings and maybe shae and tywin represents another manifestation of the deepseated animosity between tywin and tyrion with tywin essentially saying that there is nothing belonging to tyrion that he cant take away also tywin has a nasty habit of disavowing his sons it cost him dearly as he drove jaime to free tyrion and then drove tyrion to murder i guess that gets to cerseis point early in the episode about how her father is great at imposing his will on westeros but is oblivious to his own family that eventually kills him "
"1065" "OyoySavaloy" 2014-06-16 " if i was dany i would stay put it might go against her destiny etc but the climate seems to be quite nice where she is no fear of a horde of white walkers and giants coming over the hill either "

"1067" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-16 " tywin has never been what he seemed worse he really thought he was what he seemed despite it being clearly false its said a few times in the series that tyrion is the one who takes after him but i suspect he is actually more like cercei "
"1068" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-16 " i think a big part of the problem is that brianne though a nice person is not very smart she gets there eventually but it takes a while she likely had sandor categorized under bad already if shed let pod get a word in it would have gone better "
"1069" "DesmondaMaree" 2014-06-16 " possibly im reading too much into it but i wondered if he has been up to it for a long time  or if she has been a spy for him the whole time tyrion met her at tywins camp and shortly thereafter went to kings landing as acting hand  tywin seems never to have liked or trusted tyrian so its likely he would have wanted a pair of eyes close to him hmm "

"1072" "guardiansek" 2014-06-16 " this was perhaps the strongest finale so far definitely better than the last two finales a brutal and very good fight between brienne and the hound though and a nice little prelude where brienne and arya mutually admire eachotherhowever i personally thought that brienne and pod not checking with the hound didnt make sense after being immediately unable to find arya i would think they would have circled back to he went back to check in on the hound great end to aryas story line for this season though taking a last look at westeros then running to the prow of the ship to look forward to the sea and her new life so i guess shes given up on being a stark with all that entails and is off to braavos to hopefully find the assassin formerly known as jaqen hghar id like to see him again as he was suitably odd menacing and cryptic in season two of course jaqen is no longer jaqen and he probably looks entirely different and it doesnt sound practical to have old jaqen voiceact some new actor who represents jaqens current appearance i thought stannis was positively affable by his standards asking advice of jon snow however now he is literally as far from kings landing as you can get so well see where his ambitions lead next season it was tough to see dany locking up her dragons but they have been out of control all season long and they were bound to end up killing more than the occasional flock of sheep also along with the old slave representing himself and others requesting the right to sell himself back into slavery this does open up a the idea whether modern concepts of freedom are even possible in a song of ice and fire world where people and dragons havent considered the consequences of freedom also this opens up whether the original targaeryan dragonfueled conquest was an aberration maybe danys ancestors lucked into a way of controlling their dragons and harnessing them for war or if there is some kind of forgotten family knowledge that dany just no longer has access to im glad that brandon made it to the threeeyed raven im not sure i would have liked to watch him and company roam around the far north for another season im a little leery of his storyline though as my initial impression is that it will devolve into a traditional fantasy aging mentor instructs young student on how to stop zombieorcevil sorcererdragon invasion plotline still somebody has to stop the blueeyed bonebags and i personally didnt have a problem with tyrion killing shae he had obviously been pushed too far down the path of being betrayed by those he loved and he had come to his fathers chambers looking for a showdown with his chief betrayer and shae did attack him with the knife great bit with varys on the dock when he realizes that tyrion killed either his sister or father and that varys days in kings landing were over now and he would be the fall guy for releasing tyrion so now we have cersei and jaime in control in kings landing with the various tensions between them also i wonder how jaime is going to react being indirectly involved in his fathers death theres no real love lost between tywin and jaime but its one thing to free your brother from injustice its another to free him and then have him start actually murdering people so really good season not sure yet if it is my favorite got season but at its best it was pretty great back again next year i guess "
"1073" "OyoySavaloy" 2014-06-16 " what a great episode and thanks for the blogs basically every scene was top notch  standouts for me were the undead warriors and the hound vs brienne really wanted arya to stop that fight then they could team up and take on the world alas it wasnt to be tywin was a bastard but charles dance will be missed he was one of my favourites also wont there be a bit of a power vacuum situation at kings landing now just wonderful television feel a little guilty for accessing it for free now "
"1074" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-16 " a really enjoyable episode i was dreading losing the hound all season and am somewhat embarrassed to say that i didnt sleep last night as a result i was pretty sure that she and pod were going to meet up with the hound and arya this episode but i am not sure how i feel about having them fight like that  she really isnt all that bright  they should have been able to come to some reasonable resolution if shed been patient it was quite touching to have him come out and say that he was protecting arya incidentally i loved the men loading salt into the ship in aryas scene later on i am rather interested with what they are doing at the wall we still have no official leadership there why did jon say they will do what stannis decides  the wall takes no sides in the politics of westeros and despite all of stannis one true king bullshit that is still pie in the sky also is it me or are they making jon seem stupider for the show i understand cutting a lot of the wall political action but jon in my mind is not meant to be an actionoriented idiot who doesnt see the wider political and bureaucratic aspects or solutions to things dany and the dragons  well we knew it was coming since the sheep incident after being rather pointed about clarkes performances last week i thought she pulled off the anticipatory dread of the reveal rather well i wonder if there is a metaphorical understanding we are supposed to gain from her chaining her dragons underground which should help us understand why she seems so bogged down in her campaign free her dragons are wild and dangerous with no discipline no real direction so she has chained them underground and she surely cannot invade westeros that way either but how can she learn to control them is the problem with her dragons the same as the problems she is having as a governor and had as a conquerer very interesting the way they decided to deal with tyrions escape he and jaime parting on good terms for one and shae coming at him with a knife over all making things on the outside more emotionally easy perhaps for the viewers but on the other hand leaving them to wonder a little more what the heck was going on does it make his break with the lannisters seem less total the fact that shae was in tywins bed at all is fascinating a man who consistently belittles tyrions interest in whores who was so cruel to tyrions first wife labeling her a whore and who in the book paraded his fathers lover naked through the streets after his death and called her a whore i think viewers and readers might have been entirely reasonable to believe he was after his wifes death celibate and yet apparently not despite seeming a sort of grand scheming strategist with his shit together a man with a set of rigid principles however narrow they might be it seems to me like this season all of that has really been stripped away though he doesnt even realize it we see that he really didnt know what was going on with his kids that he is capable of betraying his family as the next person when it suits him that he is blind to the primary threats to the realm and politically unimaginative that he is as much a slave to his lusts as any man i feel rather badly for the mountain against all odds i dont think i would want to be subject to that sort of care "

"1078" "DesmondaMaree" 2014-06-16 " i think arya despite everything hated the hound death is the punishment she wants to mete out to the bearer of every name on her list but in the circumstances what should have been retribution became mercy and so the greater punishment was to walk away she is steely and absolutely unwavering maybe given the glimmer of something like a mutual understanding early on in that moment between them she would have softened but the hound sealed his own fate when he started talking about her friend and sansa just like the butchers boy who begged for life she let him beg for death "

"1105" "IvanCM" 2014-06-16 " if you remember earlier seasons youll recall tyrion telling the story of the first woman he was to wed and tywin made her service his whole retinue and then have tyrion have his go claiming she was just a whore in the end that is what motivates tyrion killing shae the confirmation that his father was right that whores  or in his mind any woman  would ever love him he is killing his hopes of ever being loved no strings attached personally i think it is a shame they didnt ahoot the scene between jaime and tyrion as per canon since jaime gives tyrion the motive to go up to the tower instead of out of the castle by telling him that first girl in tyrions life wasnt a whore other than that great episode "
"1106" "sezame" 2014-06-16 " shae got what she deserved but youd have had to know that from the books "
"1107" "Knowles2" 2014-06-16 " personally that was my favourite bit especially with that child throwing fire balls at the skeletons the wall could use few of them when the white walkers finally march on the wall "
"1108" "dsk84" 2014-06-16 " i was talking to my brother about the episode and he mentioned tyrion and jaime departed on different terms to how they did in the books the spoilers on the net must be pretty detailed as my brother hasnt even read the books but the nature of their departure reinforces your point about making the characters more sympathetic to tv audiences "
"1109" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-16 " yes thats what i think and i think thats why hes so broken beside her bedside killing remains killing and its the crossing of a line for the character "
"1110" "swisschocolate" 2014-06-16 " my assumption wasis that he was going there to kill tywin  and had no idea that hed find shae in his bed shae actually murmured my lion when she heard steps  which i think was what threw tyrion it was her nickname for him too  finding the woman he loved in his fathers bed hearing her use that endearment i would have killed her too at that point "
"1111" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-16 " no although i imagine he has to go some of the way given that tyrions in hiding and he might find it rather difficult to go back given that hes just helped a double murderer escape i felt the look he gave kings landing was one of loss suggesting he wouldnt be back soon "
"1112" "Rich1991" 2014-06-16 " top episode and woohoo stannis is back favourite bit was near the end when varys is smuggling tyrion onto the ship when he turns to leave then hears the alarm bells going he gives a look of oh for fucks sake tyrion and goes back on made me laugh "
"1113" "otcdave" 2014-06-16 " the tywinshae shackup really surprised me he has spent the last 4 seasons bleating on about family honour and belittling tyrion pun not overtly intended about his relationship with shae yet he has been having his way with her for a good few weeks  was this just so she would tesify in the trial otherwise it doesnt make sense yes tywin had complete contempt for his son but to bed his whore "
"1114" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-16 " oh god yes thats what i was thinking of not the evil dead they somehow all mashed into one for me i loved jason and the argonauts so much as a child "
"1115" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-16 " she also beat loras who is supposed to be a brilliant fighter i get weve not actually seen that on the show i liked the fact she was willing to play dirty when it came down to it "
"1116" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-16 " she beat jaime when he had been sitting in a cell for a year and his hands were chained together we know she was good with a sword she beat loras who was also good and she might have been as fast as the hound maybe but was not likely as strong but we know he was in bad shape slow and weak comparatively and still she barely prevailed "
"1117" "Brownly" 2014-06-16 " sad to lose the hound though i suppose he could survive but i doubt it i always thought he had a bit of a thing for sansa  as well as rescuing her he was always the first to help her after she was bullied and humiliated by joffrey at court covering her with his cloak and being gentle with her though he was mostly goading arya to give him the coup de grace he sort of confirmed that i found it oddly satisfying "
"1118" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-16 " i get those points but i really do think theres a clear moment when he knows he can either kill her and become that person or not and you see him make that choice and i think thats a decision that he will have to live with and i dont expect it to be an easy one "
"1119" "ROUcynic" 2014-06-16 " are we sure varys is gone  "
"1120" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-16 " thank you also as a book reader im in agreement i love the books i cant wait for the winds of winter even though obviously im going to have to wait and im actually a big fan of some of the less heralded storylines but i love the tv show independently of that it doesnt have to be a faithful rendition in my eyes provided it works as a compelling coherent piece of drama and i think this does i also think the deviations have often been for very smart reasons "
"1121" "Strangegoldfish" 2014-06-16 " ah did i now fair enough "
"1122" "machinecat" 2014-06-16 " i was referring to something else "
"1123" "Tibbius" 2014-06-16 " i know dany is staying where she is for tactical reasons its more the fact that it usually takes ages for people to get anywhere on this show arya has spent three seasons traipsing about never seeming to get anywhere but stannis has managed to get an army and ships sail the length of the continent and travel all the way to castle black in the blink of an eye it seemed a bit too deus ex machina for this show "
"1124" "Strangegoldfish" 2014-06-16 " i dont feel tyrions actions can or should be defended even in game of thrones murder is always wrong throwing context and apologia at such is just making excuses no what tyrion did was reprehensible and inexcusable and there will be consequences both moral and physical the look on his face as varys boxed him up for shipping seemed to say that clearly in fact that even seemed underscored to me by the scene in which sandor all but begs arya to kill him and she walks away to let him suffer a slow agonising death the only only possible way in got terms that a killing could be justified and its made the worse by not doing so "
"1125" "otcdave" 2014-06-16 " ned stark was one of the only men that stannis deemed as an honourable man so he would give jon the respect that he would have given his father even if he was his basterd "
"1126" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-16 " although the way both scenes played out was that tyrion had to have some reason to kill shae and tywin  he still has to be seen as a sympathetic character its another example of them making all the characters more easily sympathetic to television audiences it seems to be a necessary part of writing for tv i wonder though if sometimes dilutes the impact we are free to think that tyrion was forced into these actions rather than seeing them as some sort of dark impulse i tend to think we are supposed to see them as a dark impulse the question then is what we are to make of it is this the beginning of a new tyrion or does it represent the end result of the cynicism he was adopting as a result of his time as hand and in the folds of the lannister clan what are we to make then of the sorry is it him giving up or a kind of confession that may lead to a real change tyrion has been defined his whole life by the relationship to his dysfunctional family and that is what has brought him where he is will he now be able to leave that behind as for going to the room  my feeling is that he had some sort of confrontation in mind and maybe an intimation where it would go but that he was working on instinct rather than a thoughtout intent "
"1127" "ROUcynic" 2014-06-16 " strangely  i had a conversation yesterday where it was suggested that melisandre is in fact tyrions first whore  that hadnt occurred to me "

"1134" "dsk84" 2014-06-16 " finished watching the episode first up thank you sarah and the other contributors for making the recap as enjoyable as the episodes themselves im already eagerly counting down the days till april next year as as season finale this definitely worked better than last seasons  there was a lot to get through but it never felt as though it was jumping around too quickly each story other than sansalittlefinger and the boltonsreek and they somewhat reached a climax back in episode 8 anyway was looked at and closed up nicely they seemed to spend enough time with each arc and other than aryas once they were done they moved on and didnt come back which helped it flow well i did feel really bad for the dragons as much as one can feel bad for imaginary cgi lizards but dany didnt have much choice considering drogon was awol not sure theyd be as understanding though shame to see clegane go that way he really has grown on me as a character will really miss his one liners tywin will also be missed i do wish the line even if it was tyrions thoughts about lannisters not shitting gold was used but it was a powerful scene  from him realising that he had to kill shae for him to live to him killing tywin because he really is his son and in that situation tywin would do the same "

"1139" "Dewulf" 2014-06-16 " it was well foreshadowedthe neck wound was apparently infectedit makes sense physically both were very similar he has more aggression and dirty battle experience she loves fighting for a cause and has proper training and excellent gearbut he wasnt 100 so "
"1140" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-16 " it will be interesting to see where they take her storyline now it has deviated so much from the books and really cant be reconciled my guess is that what weve seen represents a large part of the journey aspect of her story and they will move on from there "
"1141" "mcscotty" 2014-06-16 " im seriously addicted to got but if they cut out the dany and the dragons saga i really wouldnt miss it "
"1142" "Chillingworth" 2014-06-16 " thought it was a tremendous final episode very well paced and some really great scenes it set everything up well for next series too especially up at the wall stannis has always been one of my favorites and i think hes going to come into his own now the dynamic between him jon and mance will be excellent and should give the scenes at the wall a new level of interest and intensity would have perhaps liked a more exciting final scene but i suppose it was nice to finish with something positive especially for arya who has had it so tough a whole nine months till the next series starts with the only little hints of casting decisions and new shooting locations to keep us fanatics going in the meantime that said im not sure ill be visiting the fan sites such as winteriscomingnet as much anymore im afraid this episode marked the tipping point where i could no longer read the endless complaints about deviations from the books im a book reader and while i am interested in thinking about and discussing where appropriate how and why things have changed in the tv show i still view and enjoy the tv show as something independent of the books it seems now like there is a growing proportion of book readers who are unable to accept the fact that certain changes have been made out of necessity due to the constraints of the medium or even because of the flabbiness of the source material id much rather read the comments on a site like this now than the incessant whining on one of the fan sites well done sarah and all the commentors for making this such a great read each week i rarely post here but i always make a point of reading the blog and comments after each episode until next year valar morghulis "

"1150" "Dewulf" 2014-06-16 " i gotta agree with roganis here on all points here well said id only add that the second tyrion realised this traitorous person whom he had only tried to protect against her own worst instincts at times was actually going to try and kill him rather than talk to him he not only has to kill her he can do so without somehow sacrificing the essentially good tag weve given him he may mourn what they once had and what he had to do  but there was no choice to be made on his part "

"1155" "ffuzzy" 2014-06-16 " as previously posted i enjoyed this also no tits or boobs again it can be done very sad to see the hound vs arya end  saw that coming but will he really be killed off did she fail to kill him as suffering is worse than death for him or could she not bring her self to also sad to see the end of charles dance  didnt see that coming at all as has been mentioned before not read books once this really kicks into fantasy land of shining trees dragons and fighting dead people ill probably bow out as i have found these plot lines less interesingt but all good so far also i think tyrions further motivation for killing is hearing shae whisper my lion thinking he is tywin  further confirmation of what a fool he has been "
"1156" "Laika57" 2014-06-16 " i think the tragedy of it was that tyrion knew it was either her or him  he basically had to kill her or she would have stabbed him and raised the alarm and one way or another tyrion would be dead he obviously went to kill his father and unexpectedly found shae there in his bed bad timing "
"1157" "maclau1" 2014-06-16 " disturbing in many ways my daughter was most upset about the dragons very good ending will look for more of your excellent writing in the interim "
"1158" "Rp Bird" 2014-06-16 " personal prediction based on my knowledge of the books dont worry not giving anything away its just if you know the works of the late fritz leiber youll know what i mean when i say the next season will seem more like a trip to lankhmar than braavos "
"1159" "MMGALIAS" 2014-06-16 " that would have been horrible that would have been typical game of thrones "
"1160" "MMGALIAS" 2014-06-16 " the murder of shae challenges that notion – and tyrion himself is aware of that fact we understand how tywin’s death happens this is a man who has belittled and betrayed his son for most of his life and who in his arrogance fails to take him seriously even when there’s a crossbow involved but shae’s murder represents a line crossed yes you can make a case for an element of selfpreservation and that it was necessary to stop shae raising the alarm but i think it’s made quite clear that tyrion does what he does because of a combination of love hatred selfloathing and despair there’s a moment when he could stop but he chooses not to hence the whispered sorrow and the hatred for tywin who once again brands shae nothing more than a whore i disagree it was not only selfdefence that lead him to kill her but the fact that she was sleeping with the man he was trying to protect her from and ultimately the reason they werent together anymore on top of that she testified against him he had to kill her "
"1161" "roganis" 2014-06-16 " so would i have this being got if tyrion had stopped to have a chat with shae she would have just had another go at grabbing the knife he still kind of defended her honour when he fired the bow at his dad although the way both scenes played out was that tyrion had to have some reason to kill shae and tywin  he still has to be seen as a sympathetic character but if he wasnt going to kill tywin anyway why did he make his way to his room "
"1162" "WhoGivesADamn" 2014-06-16 " the hound lost to brienne of f tarth i hate you benioff  weiss "
"1163" "euryleia" 2014-06-16 " i thought much the same i was half expecting the titan to move somehow the noises the skeletons made were really unnerving too s "
"1164" "MMGALIAS" 2014-06-16 " its a shame im going to miss the adventures of arya and the hound "
"1165" "MojitoPlease" 2014-06-16 " i did notice that and realised they might merge her character with another from the books im actually taking it as a foreshadow of what grrm hasnt publishedcommitted to paper yet "
"1166" "euryleia" 2014-06-16 " bran’s warging into hodder makes me uncomfortable hodor  couldnt fault any of that and i thought the skeletons were excellently done i want more now flails "
"1167" "roganis" 2014-06-16 " well spotted re the giant statue i thought the same with the skeletons  heres a video of the original skeleton fight  httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvpffi7x93py "
"1168" "dhulmes" 2014-06-16 " saw an interview with anton lesser on youtube in which he confirmed that hes back for five episodes next season so looks like there will be a lot more of qyburn in season 5  which can only be good news "
"1169" "dsk84" 2014-06-16 " my missus referred to game of thrones as the love of my life im glad im with someone whos open and accommodating enough to acceprt that and not get in the way as for the episode im still watching it  the recap is up pretty early this week "
"1170" "FatFrank" 2014-06-16 " didnt much like the stuff with the ice zombies and mystical tree man ive been waiting for you such a long time cheesy the supernatural stuff should be very light in got or it spoils it freaked out by tyrions story now they had it coming but likewise the hound and brienne and aryas lack of mercy the most sympathetic characters have done cruel and terrible things we saw brienne fight without honour and tyrion become a murderer i dont feel shocked but strangely unsatisfied it didnt fit the way that other wtf moments have done it felt wrong i know moral ambiguity is what this is all about but everything felt a bit too sullied by this ending and im not sure the grubbiness works as drama i could cope with the red wedding and ned starks beheading but i couldnt cope with this "
"1171" "dhulmes" 2014-06-16 " totally agree another excellent episode  possibly the strongest three episode streak in the shows run although if forced to choose i think season 3 would be my favourite season  cant explain why but it just edges it as a book reader im interested to see if the quality of the show can remain as high given the drop in quality of the last two books i have a quiet confidence given the deviations that weve seem so far regarding this episodeloved mancejonstannis at the wall  the showrunners could do worse than make this dynamic one of the cornerstones of season 5 rory mccann was brilliant in his tragic and desperate final momentsi like the decision to give arya the end of season moment  i think we all needed a bit of optimism to tie us over for ten monthsthe cast of kings landing has been totally cleansed  wonder if the show will continue to revolve around it as much as it had done in the previous 4 seasons also thanks to sarah for writing these recaps  mondays in work will be much more of a struggle for the next ten months i suspect oh well valar morghulis "
"1172" "hazh" 2014-06-16 " not exactly sure why but it got me a bit emotional about it felt very much like the final closing of a chapter with arya and tyrionvarys sailing away i wasnt sure before when i first saw the giant statue over braavos but now im sure when we have the skeletons popping up from the ice it looks to be a deliberate homage to ray harryhausens jason and the argonauts for those too young to have seen it here are the images from the film  talos and the skeleton soldiers "
"1173" "pseudosp1n" 2014-06-16 " i came to a realisation during that last episode in almost every regard  the plot the dialogue the imagery the foreshadowing the callbacks the selfconsistency   i prefer the way it is done in the books so im going to resolve to not watch any more from season 5 onwards i wonder if ill stick to it "
"1174" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-16 " yes but theres definitely a moment where he realises what hes doing and still kills her anyway "
"1175" "Dewulf" 2014-06-16 " i have just one thing to say at first about this episode omg game of thrones d "
"1176" "JamesH91" 2014-06-16 " im glad that they had oberyn poison gregor clegane and theyve hinted at the fucking sick shit that qyburn gets up to in the coming series one of the most disturbing characters in the show in his own subtle way "
"1177" "grayfox" 2014-06-16 " i dont think well have to worry about book spoilers from next season onwards itll be the other way round there was one farily big one in this series although it was more of a confirmation than a surpise and hidden away in the credits im expecting a huge one at the beginning of series 5 that will really annoy the readers bill hicks emphasis i would be seriously considering not watching it if i wasnt getting more and more convinced that hell never finish them still looking forward to it some great performances again and the visual spectacle of it all is going from strength to strength "
"1178" "David Flynn" 2014-06-16 " id love to see some sort of graph now comparing where the characters are now at the end of the fourth season compared to the end of the third book which is pretty much where the tv show is there or there abouts anyway the timeline is so muddled now its hard to know exactly where who or what is going to be in season 5 or how much closer to rr martin they will get within the next two or three seasons its really not a great choice to be faced with do the shows makers slow down the series much like the plot of the books slows now and allow martin to get some breathing space or do they barrel on ahead catching up or even overtaking martin in the process i cant decide which would be better or more to the point which would be worse "
"1179" "ocelot75" 2014-06-16 " lady sarah of the house of hughes thank you so much for your fantastic blog "
"1180" "Ashamanic" 2014-06-16 " i dont know that it could be counted as murder of shae she attacked him so it was in some ways self defence even if he did feel badcompared to the books his reasons for both going to see tywin and killing him made no sense if you call shae a whore again i will kill you has no logic to it he might be feeling bad about killing her but he knew she was a whore tywin knew she was a whore and shae knew she was a whorethe briennesandor fight was ok it will be interesting to see where they take her storyline now it has deviated so much from the books and really cant be reconciled "
"1181" "penny0604" 2014-06-16 " stannis and davos looked badass as always  i could have done with a slightly longer battle scene to overcome the wildlings but they would have struggled to fit it in mance is ace jon snow burning ygritte was really moving and everyone is off to braavos  cant wait for next season and i hope mycroft is back "
"1182" "dsk84" 2014-06-16 " i did notice that and realised they might merge her character with another from the books though if i were jon i would definitely be cautious "
"1183" "Tibbius" 2014-06-16 " it was a fantastic episode but one thing really bugged me its taken four seasons for dany to get an army and shes still not at a point where shes ready to invade westeros and yet stannis has managed to buy himself an army sail from bravos to the wall and attack the north in a couple of episodes i know it would have spoiled the surprise but a bit of buildup to such a huge event would have been nice "
"1184" "roganis" 2014-06-16 " btw did you notice melisandre giving jon the eye mmmm "
"1185" "roganis" 2014-06-16 " yes you can make a case for an element of selfpreservation and that it was necessary to stop shae raising the alarm you can also make the case that shae came at tyrion with a knife  this was what brought on tyrions attack rather than her raising the alarm "
"1186" "recesnap" 2014-06-16 " and as is traditional i cant point out a spelling mistake without making a typo "
"1187" "recesnap" 2014-06-16 " havent seen teh episode yet  but i suspect bran wargs into hodor not hodder "
"1188" "JamesH91" 2014-06-16 " so as one double act breaks up with arya running off to bravos and the hound incapacitated but not necessarily dead we seem to get another one with the tyrion and varys show great stuff "
"1189" "moltenmarvel" 2014-06-16 " hopefully tywins death marks the last time we will ever hear the most overplayed song in westeros "
"1190" "thepresident99" 2014-06-16 " best scene was jon snow and stannis and their mutual respect is respect the right word for a while i thought jamie was setting tyrion up that would have been horrible "
"1191" "maclean3" 2014-06-16 " finally stannis is awesome again "
"1192" "DocJane" 2014-06-16 " loved the scene with varys sitting beside tyrions crate "
"1193" "MojitoPlease" 2014-06-16 " i suspect that line has been used before over the last few seasons but who cares still brilliant "
"1194" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-16 " ha exactly well done "
"1195" "MojitoPlease" 2014-06-16 " as a book reader i called the ending when having a chat with a workmate a few weeks ago however i was wondering how they were going to rid us of the hound a really wellcalled deviation from canon amongst an episode of very powerful performances maisie williams was phenomenal yet again and stood out i cannot wait for next season particularly if any of the cast of vikings appear in the iron islands d "
"1196" "sobczyk1982" 2014-06-16 " nobody expects the stannis inquisition "
"1197" "EssAitchAy" 2014-06-16 " wonderful episode wonderful series of blogs thank you so much for all of the entertainment over the weeks sarah that tyrion eh "
