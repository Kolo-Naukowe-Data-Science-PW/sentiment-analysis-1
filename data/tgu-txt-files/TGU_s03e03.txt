"3" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-04-21 " singist  fair enough they are not pledged to robb or house stark but are basically outlaws operating in the riverlands and dedicated to rhllor the lord of light rather than the old gods of the northmen but im still fairly sure that the starkstullys are where their sympathies lie spoiler warningi think below has been covered in the tv series but just in casea the brotherhood without banners is usually led by beric dondarrion  oft reported dead in season 1 episode a golden crown ned stark at that time hand of the king at kings landing charged gregor the mountain with treason and ordered lord dondarrion to bring gregor clegane to justice thoros of myr joined dondarrion in that hunt and the brotherhood are still raiding lannister bannermen so there is at least an antilannister allegiance amongst the bannermenb thoros of myr also appears to be protective of arya stark youre not a prisoner youll have no chains youre a guest but youre lucky we found you and he also calls her my lady i cannot imagine the brave companions saying that but i expect thoros would want to be wellrewarded for handing her and the hound over  presumably to robbher mother riverrun is a lot nearer to them than winterhell lol and they may already know of the fall of the latter but yes pledged was the wrong term  "

"8" "Sojournernz" 2013-04-21 " acertainbang  having read the books  honestly there are so many plot points which could be big climaxes  as the screenwriters have fiddled enough with mr martins chronology now that jaimes hand is off i am looking forward to some absolute doozies "

"11" "chiefdeluxer" 2013-04-20 " alex239  what an odd thing to say game of thrones hardly trades off tastefulness it trades in good characters good actors and a story well told it also trades in sex violence gallows humour foul language and a hobbesian world view on the brutishness of life if you listen to any of the first four hold steady albums you might catch a glimpse that those latter themes run right through their baudy anything goes but incredibly street smart and sometimes profound pieces in the medium of rock they have produced some excellent work  while the nature of the song may have jarred you and others your reaction to their being able to contribute stylistically and labelling them as landfill shows a basic level of dare i say it cretionous muscial ignorance "

"16" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-04-20 " sandor clegane aka the hound  surely hell be welldisposed towards arya and house stark i say this because it was ned stark that ordered the arrest of the mountain in series 1 and the hound hates his older brother gregor because he was badly burnt and abused by him when younger and because sansa helped him hide after blackwater id have thought hed also favour the stark girls i do understand that arya wont reciprocate as he killed sansas direwolf lady and the butcher boy in series 1 "
"17" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-04-20 " sarah  your excellent review asked us where is thoros taking arya surely to riverrun as the brotherhood without banners are northmen pledged to robb stark "
"18" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-04-20 " am i right in thinking that sam had made some kind of promise to gilly that if he returned to crasters camp as he has done that hed help her escape the images of him peering through the tent flap whilst shes giving birth reminded me that he might try and get away with her especially as shes had a boy and craster hands any male newborn over to the wights this week we saw a coming of age for sam as although he forgot to send the ravens earlier  hes now having to be more assertive without jon being around to protect him "
"19" "5432Hun" 2013-04-19 " thenorthremembers  its jaime who says he has been captive a year i agree i dont think the timeline from jaimes capture to gilly giving birth works unless we allow that the nights watch has been north of the wall for the best part of a year as we know them which doesnt seem that likely given distances etc more fundamentally what does anyone on that world mean by a year anyway a year is defined by either the time taken to orbit the nearest star or by the full rotation of seasons on a world where seasons are of extremely variable length and they have no astronomy which we are aware of a year could be anything so is pretty much useless as a measure of time "
"20" "5432Hun" 2013-04-19 " crehane  im glad to hear the series still has the power to surprise i was waiting for mrs 5432hun to scream when he cut his hand off but she had hidden her face as soon as locke put that big knife near jaimes eye  then she admitted to having read a review that day so knew it was coming we watched it a day late "
"21" "crehane" 2013-04-19 " 5432hun  came as a total shocksurprise as the scene was playing out i was thinking that jaime was going to use his charm and cunning to get himself free and armed that he would free brienne and that the two best swordspeople in westeros were going to initiate a bloodbath then i though jaime was going to lose an eye boy did i get it wrong "
"22" "crehane" 2013-04-19 " stratos  exactly i reckon that she has know all along what the slave trader has been saying and is playing him like a pro this is reinforced by the fact that as she and her newly acquired translator are leaving the translator says valar morghulis all men must die in old valyrian and dany instantly understands and retorts yes all men must die but we are not men interesting point here does the we refer to dany and the translator or does it refer to them to her new eunuch army the unsullied and to her dragons as well either way its a thinly veiled threat which suggests that dany is about to get medieval on the slave traders ass "
"23" "crehane" 2013-04-19 " johnnyg79  agree on the ending i was almost as shocked as jaime was i also liked the closing credits song it was totally jarring in the same way as what happened to jaime was totally jarring thinking back to his face off with ned stark i remember thinking how deliciously and viciously lethal he seemed as such the loss of his right hand just seems like the end of the world for jaime lannister "
"24" "crehane" 2013-04-19 " greedo1980  can appreciate how things can prove a little confusing at times however due to the high density of the source material ie the books a key point in my opinion is that every episode of the tv series requires as a minimum at least two viewings there is quite simply so much in each episode practically every scene contains essential information furthermore if youve watched season 1 and 2 then i would recommend to anybodyeverybody to read books 1  2 do that and watch every episode twice and youll never be confused ever again maybe "
"25" "crehane" 2013-04-19 " natzandtheratz  the talk of closing credit as well as in episode songs got me curious about both the the rains of castamere and the beast and the maiden fair researching the words of rains of castamere led me to a wiki of ice and fire warning do not do as i did as the section on that website that covers the rains of castamere contains what i would classify as a significant spoiler you have been warned however on the topic of the other song the beast and the maiden fair which featured during episode 3 as well as at the end in punk form i have a suspicion which im hoping to confirm anybody remember mention of the fact that gary lightbody lead singer of the band snow patrol was to make a cameo in got well i reckon thats him singing the beast and the maiden fair during episode 3 reckon id recognise the dulcet tones of his county down brogue anywhere anybody agree withable to confirm my suspicions "

"329" "ChinofJim" 2013-04-16 " sarahhughes  i think one of the problems for last season was that a lot of what happens to dany in the second book is quite internal its interesting but hard to adapt i guess they could have cut her story time down in the the second season but i would imagine they would find that hard for a number of reasons she is one of the most popular characters after season 1 she probably went through the biggest character arc in season 1 and viewers might feel short changed if there isnt some sort of pay off emilia clarke is no doubt on a contract and they feel they have to use her etcsaying that they werent afraid to severely restrict any screen time for jaime in season 2 and it turned out fine without harming in anyway his emergence as one the central characters this season i think with robb i would say the problem is that he didnt get enough screen time we are constantly told by other characters that he is the young wolf and that he wins battles against more experienced lannister leaders but we dont ever actually see that i can fully understand that they cant be showing battle scenes for many reasons budget logistics etc so i will give them a pass on that but it does i think harm his character when all we get is tell rather than show "

"362" "ChinofJim" 2013-04-16 " diamonddag  regarding why jaime killed the mad kingthere was a scene in season 1 where jaime king robert and selmy and maybe ned cant remember are discussing their 1st kills and other nostalgic things during the converstaion jaime mentions that the last thing king aerys said was burn them all that stops the conversation stone dead and even king robert the blustering mark addy looks an bit shocked at that tidbit i would think it is open to interpretation how significant that is and indeed what jaimes motivation was in killing the king i think though that the important thing is that broadly speaking jaime felt he did something was was just king was committing atrocities and called for king was threatening to escalate these atrocities and what thanks does he get everyone questions his honor puts him down as an oathbreaker and he gets to carry round the insulting epithet kingslayer thematically i love how this bleeds into the world of westoros onscreen we have jorah teaching dany about the realities of war and negating any chivalric idealistic notions of how things are done his suggestion to get round this and avoid the horrors hire an army of soldiers who have all been brutally maimed and taught how to kill babys in cold blood these ironies are epitomised by jaime the one thing he has done that he felt was morally right and he gets hammered for it for having broken all codes of honor "

"370" "jennifera30" 2013-04-16 " i assume the wall was built to protect the south from the others and their like it seems like it was so far back in time that most have forgotten that they are real and might presume it is to hold back the wildlings in the first series there is talk about how even direwolves have not been seen for hundreds of years everyone seems to dismiss talk of supernatural entities as silly hence all the talk of grumpkins and snarks even the watch are unprepared for the first walkers they come across the climate thing is difficult to be sure of the realm has summers that last for years and you would have to presume that even the far north gets enough of a summer to grow crops of some kind of course winter is coming now so things are about to get really tough i can understand sam keeping his weight while he was stationed at the wall food was plentiful there and he didnt seem to have a demanding job but you have got to wonder why he isnt shedding it like crazy at the moment even though each area has its own lords and armies they are all eventually under the authority of the iron throne look how ned had to step around robert and basically do his bidding despite being the warden of the north the identity of theons captor has yet to be revealed to anyone obviously people who have read the books have a fair idea but as viewers we are supposed to still be in the dark a few people have asked why the hound would name arya and im surprised that people are surprised she is nothing to him he isnt one of the game players and doesnt really have any kind of agenda he liked sansa because she showed him some kindness and was pretty and sweet but he owes no loyalty to house stark in general this is all guesswork and opinion on my part of course that is part of the fun "

"459" "ntofr1" 2013-04-15 " sarahhughes  it def wasnt slow it works better that we loose some characters each episode and return to them the following week i think last season would have benefitted from a similar pacing to this season but i guess they are learning as they go along its not like this kind of series has been made before "
"460" "ntofr1" 2013-04-15 " chinofjim  excellent point its a shame that men have to loose their todgers and kill babies to find some restraint but i guess its important to see how devilish acts can be turned into positive deeds and vice versa "

"478" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-15 " mrkris  this has always been very much my take on theon as well i dont see why he has to feel loyalty to the starks  although i do think he behaves badly where robb is concerned as far as robb was concerned they were like brothers after all "

"542" "ChinofJim" 2013-04-15 " crooky  apart from saying that there need to be some sacrifices that they need to spill some royal blood sure she did show a bit more restraint in terms of letting stannis be putting shadow ghoul buns in the oven but she claimed this was because it would kill him "
"543" "ChinofJim" 2013-04-15 " singist  youd think there is little chance now of him ever being hand of the king at least littlefinger can feel smug that someone has even less fingerish than him "
"544" "ChinofJim" 2013-04-15 " 14juillet  i would much prefer they let the scenes breathe than subject us to choppy editing or characters spitballing out dialigoue at 100 mph like you see in the likes of doctor who also i appreciate that although it is a dialogue heavy show it does have filmic moments where the story telling and character dynamics are played out in visual terms for instance the scene the with the small council arranging their chairs in relation to tywin maybe you felt it dragged and harmed the pace i thought it set up a wonderfull payoff when tywin shakes the likes of varys and pycelle out of their comfort zone when admonishing them for their inability to know what is going on with jaime "

"548" "Sharon Gordon" 2013-04-15 " whats up with the music for the closing credits "
"549" "Crooky" 2013-04-15 " sarah just wanted to ask when you wrote the relationship between robb and talisa remains the series biggest misstep did you mean tactically from robbs point of view or that the series should have stuck closer to the books "
"550" "Crooky" 2013-04-15 " that was so gripping even though i knew what was coming with jamie it was still shockinggreat interplay between the actors at the council scene the catelyn scene was very moving a really good mix of light and dramaticin some ways the tv series is better than the books the casting is terrific the plotting is tighter and they have developed scenes of their own that make you care about the characters the writers arent afraid to slow it down at times and have small quiet moments like arya and the breadand its good to have some scenes that are fresh for book readers "
"551" "odl2000" 2013-04-15 " why the music choice at the end i didnt dislike it but why the sudden change i wonder makes me realise how involved i am in the show "
"552" "14Juillet" 2013-04-15 " sarahhughes  just a note on what i see as padding it has nothing to do with the inclusion of scenes or charactersit is in the shot and editing choices and the cadence of the actors movement and delivery shots that linger on detail before the scene extended pauses during the seen and lingering shots at the end of a scene and prolonged transitions from scene to scene all of these are subtle ways of padding and can add up to several minutes of screen time the more storey threads there are the more opportunities there are to extend the playing time9 episodes can become 10 and the process may even enrich the viewers experience or at least not seriously compromise the narrativeby stretching or padding the studios are producing significantly more product to sell at a lower unit price something that hard pressed producers of an expensive production would be encouraged to do "
"553" "HolmbergsMistake" 2013-04-15 " souflondoner  youre right he was reaching too far and it slipped out of his grasp "
"554" "jlittlewood" 2013-04-15 " how did pod do it they best reveal his tips on satisfying a woman in the next episode forget about all this war and dragons nonsense i must know what pod did "
"555" "14Juillet" 2013-04-15 " sarahhughes  thank you for your thoughtful replyi think i have truly spoiled myself for traditional episodic tv as i now watch only boxed sets though i did stream house of cards over the course of a week or so watching goft weekly has been an exception and something of a revelationprograms i have most enjoyed watching much as i would read a good novel have been engrenages borgen the killing the bridge and the first two series of goftall have wonderful novelistic detail and are much more to my taste than than even the 90120 minute movieperhaps we will see more opportunities to watch this type of programming in the way the house of cards was made availablei for one would pay a premium to do so "
"556" "MoreTears" 2013-04-15 " souflondoner  it was a shame jaime losing what sarah calls his sword hand he wont be able to effectively brandish a literal sword either "

"559" "14Juillet" 2013-04-15 " i just feel we are being played i will wait for the boxed series i watched the first two series over the course of a few weeks and enjoyed it the weekly format is too slow for me i thought so last week and foolishly watched again and found it irritating enough to comment both ill considered choices my apologies "
"560" "MoreTears" 2013-04-15 " sarahhughes  line of duty had five episodes in its seasonseries the writer cant really slow the pace down when he has only five episodes to work with since lennie james was in line of duty your bringing up this issue makes me think of james next show amcs upcoming series low winter sun the original low winter sun was a twopart drama on channel 4 in 2006 i didnt care for the original in part because the whole story was ridiculously rushed now amc is doing a remake but they have ordered 10 episodes for the first season and of course there could be a number of seasons after that a story that had to be crammed into two 90minute episodes on british tv now gets to be aired out potentially over years on american tv "
"561" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-15 " deletethispost  thank you very much i really enjoy writing it and generally the commentators are pretty good although fighting the potential spoiler deluge can be a bit worryingsorry slighttrout i couldnt resist the ellipses "
"562" "SarahHughes" 2013-04-15 " 14juillet  i honestly think theyve got the pacing just right so far this season which i didnt last year then again i like a slow build in drama and its increasingly common on cable shows youd hardly call mad men treme even breaking bad particularly fast moving indeed i sometimes struggle with uk series having just come back from america because they seem to be throwing stuff in for the sake of something happening or pacing it too fast line of duty was a great example of this i really enjoyed it but i would have enjoyed it far more if theyd had the confidence to slow it down im also really not convinced by your padding argument  i do think there is still the odd little scene they dont need a sense that theyre checking in with characters to keep everyone happy but the scenes this week were all pretty geared towards driving the plot forward i felt  then again im a sucker for the power play in the small council meeting its true the stuff with tyrion and pod and bronn could have probably been dropped  and i half agree with whoever said last week that theyre worried the writers think they have to include tyrion every week  but i actually think its quite fun to sometimes just hang out with the characters a bit and learn about them i can see this might not be to everyones taste "

"564" "David Stevenson" 2013-04-15 " one great thing this series is doing is making george rr martin finish the sriesthere many years between 5 books and now hell need to close series out unlike the wheel of time author who took something lik3 10 volumes to do that also for readers of martinfevre dreamvampires in the new orleans areaits very very good almost literature but its very very good and scary "
"565" "HolmbergsMistake" 2013-04-15 " and varys and pycelle finally make it onto the screen another reminder of how vast the evergrowing cast is though in this episode it appears to have been reduced by one and peacefully too  farewell hot pie may your dough always rise and your crusts be evercrunchy nice as well to see the audience reacting with sympathy to a character who started the series by pushing a kid out a window getting his hand cut off its a testament to the writers and nikolaj costerwaldau that theyve pulled off the same transition of sympathy without the use of pov narration "
