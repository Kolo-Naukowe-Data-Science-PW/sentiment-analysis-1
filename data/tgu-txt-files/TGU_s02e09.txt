"71" "badger1969" 2012-05-30 " do we know if the idea of marrying joffrey off to margaery tyrell ever came to anything the idea was i think to get the tyrells and the knight of flowers on side with the lannisters since from last nights episode the tyrells seem to have thrown their lot in with tywin lannister anyway do we assume that joffrey is now to tie the knot with margaery if so that would put sansas future with joffery in even more doubt a very good question but  as has already been indicated by a couple of earlier replies  it does rather highlight the problem with this being an adaptation of a book rather than an original series its the sort of thing you might see discussed ad nauseum if it were an original series i must admit i thought the idea had been mentioned already on tv  maybe by tyrion  if it hasnt maybe discussing it is more questionable  though i dont see theres too big a problem discussing differences between the tv  the books when its discussing past events   missing characters as long as it doesnt lead to too much discussion of future events  other than pure speculation i assume we will find out next week the details of the deal between the tyrells  the lannisters  presumably brokered by littlefinger after he left harrenhal this may or may not involve margaery  joffrey certainly a sansajoffrey marriage hasnt made a huge amount of sense for some time   with winterfell no longer in stark hands it makes even less sense at this point what might happen to sansa if she doesnt marry joffrey  especially ifwhen jaime returns to kings landing andor it becomes known to the lannisters that he is no longer in stark hands well i suppose that might depend to a large extent how much power tyrion still holds at the time id trust him to keep his word  return sansa to the starks but cersei or tywin of course i know what actually happens but its still fun to speculate based only on the tv stuff so far i hope we get at least some answers next week "

"257" "Clariana" 2012-05-29 " only one problem with that bards in asoiaf tend to meet very sticky ends "
"258" "Casimer" 2012-05-29 " yes monty pythons holy grail flashed into my mind as well  run away although that didnt remove anything from a truly great and enjoyable episode i hope tyrions okay "
"259" "euryleia" 2012-05-29 " shame about the lack of big chain i thought that was a particularly nasty idea other than that no faulting the episode imo "
"260" "monkey2" 2012-05-29 " wow where do i begin with how great this episode was firstly bronn and the hound swinging their dicks before the bells of terror secondly if all the writers got together and said lets come up with the crappest name for a sword possible the outright winner would definitely be heart eater brilliant thirsdly cersei she has been quite annoying thus far but in this episode her turn to drunken nihilism was fantastic best line of the episode see all these women they will be in for a bit of a rape half of them will have bastards in them by tomorrow tyrion the brave tyrion the powerful is he turning into a compassionate version of his father a brilliant and brave tactician these are the abilities jaime does not have he should be king joffrey was inept in just about every possible way did not know when to strike with the arrows could not comprehend the wildfire and when it mattered he bottled it the hounds moment of realisation was a big suprise the whole fuck the king rant was great what exactly could joffrey say to him  nothing tywin lannister now there was a suprise he did a rob stark and told everyone he was going one place and then went another and he saved the day brilliant the wildfire explosion this was the only scene that was spectacular in the big budget sense of the word which was great as it looked so good the direction of this episode was top notch no vistas no panning no bullshit the more is less way of depicting a terrifying situation will always be a winner and as we know neill marshall of dog soldiers and the descent is a virtuoso in this department so the aftermath obviously there will be absolutely no public confidence in joffrey for his abandonment tywin i think will effectively become king and will just wheel joffrey out occasionally im confused as to whether stannis was captured if so that will be interesting all in all it was a brilliant episode so good in fact that i watched it again straight away "
"261" "CavalierDisregard" 2012-05-29 " great episode would have liked to see the chain and tywin dressed as renly as in the book but impressive stuff nonetheless its actually loras who dresses as renly in the book and he was in the episode its not made that obvious no one screams argh its renlys ghost come for revenge for example but if you look at his helmet you can see stag antlers "
"262" "Writer83" 2012-05-29 " wow i came away from this episode thinking it was by far the worst in the whole two series one dimensional full of plot holes drawn out predictable and rather dull how out of touch with the rest of humanity am i generally a top series though "
"263" "Murphed" 2012-05-29 " the one thing that annoyed me about the episode was how they kept cutting away to the throne room door it was pretty much telegraphing what was going to happen in the scene i actually liked it it was great tv i knew that someone would come bursting through the door at the end but we had no idea who in conversation with mrs murphed we were guessing it was either stannis tywin or rob but having not read the books and being a little lost as to who was where we didnt have a clue i must say however i did guess right but that just made me more pleased that i had at last got to grips with this show i was still surprised though it was a brilliant ending to a brilliant episode "
"264" "SterlingArcher" 2012-05-29 " my favourite band  my favourite book has had me giddy for the last couple of days to much greatness in one place if the national could make an appearance further down the line as extras that would be amazing for me your mileage my vary "
"265" "JoeOrdinary" 2012-05-29 " my only problem with this episode was sansa not leaving with sandor when she had the chance shes afraid of getting practically being reduced to a sex slave by the repugnant joffrey she hates and fears cersei shes a hostage of war she might get gangraped if stannis army winsand she turns down an offer of escape with a man who has proven in past episodes that he will protect her and is one of the fiercest warriors in existence as long as fire is not involved with the exception that it wouldnt exactly be a laughaminute buddy road movie sandor is about the best traveling companion that a woman could ask for in the middle of a war what is she hanging onto in kings landing her refusal to leave made no sense to me in fairness in the book it was clear what sandor was after when he cornered sansa in the series it was at a moment when stannis was odds on to win and so she hoped to escape joffrey that way great episode tyrions battle speech was a brilliantly cynical piss take of all the henry v  aragorn rallying speeches didnt know till this morning that the national had done the music theres a part for a minstel later in the story come on mr berninger give it a go "
"266" "Clariana" 2012-05-29 " you usually suggest a theme for each episode sarah may i suggest that this one should be courage "

"269" "SterlingArcher" 2012-05-29 " loved the minor theme of characters beginning their back stories then not quite following through bronn being distracted by nudity varys well maybe ill tell you someday and shae just being interrupted as she started seemed like grrm might be having a little fun with viewers used to the way the series does its exposition "
"270" "Foom" 2012-05-29 " just thinking if were going to get popular beat combos to do the songs of got like the national doing rains of castamere then can i suggest electric 6 for the bear and the maiden fair or possibly jedward "
"271" "MarSane" 2012-05-29 " there wasnt i guess it would also have been very uncomfortable to ask 42 yearold rory mccann to share a kiss with 15 yearold sophie turner yes there was a kiss and a song and sansa keeps thinking back to it the scene totally gave away the tension between this very unlikely couple it should have ended with a bit more but yes if everybody is so queasy about a 42yearold kissing a teenager then that makes it clear gods we have seen so many horrors and so much sex in got how can this be the big taboo "
"272" "MarSane" 2012-05-29 " the rains of castamere was great  its nice to see it making an appearance so early in the series its a song to remember especially with the return of tywin to kings landing they had to introduce the song early so everybody can understand the jokes about it in season three i loved the scene where cersei explains the horrors that await the women in case stannis wins to sansa and then sansa takes a really big gulp of the wine she rather detested earlier "
"273" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-29 " excellent post and i completely agree with you about martin being scriptwriter meaning that we concentrate on core narrative i do think theres an issue with reaching a wider audience staying faithful to the books and im going to talk about it next week its one of the reasons why i think this season has had flaws as a piece of tv but not necessarily as an adaptation although it doesnt actually stop me loving it also that said i agree with the poster who said that the filler of last week did have the payoff of this week because of its scene setting my problem is that i dont think benioff and weiss have always dropped the right stories at the right time but as mentioned thats an issue for the last episode "
"274" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-29 " ha good point and thank you well i equivocated because i only got to watch it once before writing and i feel that calling something perfect without having watched it a second time when not writing madly at the same time was a bit premature i may well decide its perfect after watching it a second time though "
"275" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-29 " this will sound a little odd but i think stannis is a bit mad in the same way i think arsene wenger is a bit mad theyre both driven by the idea that theirs is the only way to do something they are convinced they have right on their side and that this will ensure they win out in the end and thus they persist in doing it that way week in week out despite mounting evidence to the contrary "
"276" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-29 " 1 pedant  they were trying to sack the city ok they failed but still 2 ill discuss this more next week because its the final episode but to give an example ive found a lot of the qarth scenes horrid actually they dont seem that well thought out and emilia clark whose performance enjoyed last season has appeared diminished imo "
"277" "Musa1" 2012-05-29 " stannis does display courage in leadership but what was his battleplan did he think he could siege a castle which has never been breached in one try did he not think to set up a base camp or just throw everything at the mud gate and damn the idea of a long drawn out siege and its true how did tywin arrive at the castle at the same time as stannis and why didnt anyone from stannis camp see tywins forces arriving a proper siege considers an entire castle and its surroundings and the possibility of outside attacks not only the point of assault anyways the success of this episode shows the failure of previous episodes which showed only 5 minutes per storylinesubplot  "
"278" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-05-29 " response to weewilkie 29 may 2012 700am precisely my thoughts having seen the terrible destruction by the wildfire tyrion understood that stannis and his men were brave and would fight to the very end the only way to stop them from sacking kings landing was to kill them simple direct and purposeful no false bravado no mockery of the foes "
"279" "gooddogs" 2012-05-29 " god i love this show "
"280" "weewilkie" 2012-05-29 " those are brave men knocking at our doorlets go kill them i cant believe that some people think that this was a lame climax to tyrions call to arms for me its got just the right mixture of fear and bravado dinklages delivery gave me goosebumps "
"281" "objectinspace" 2012-05-29 " loved that they included this in the end credits of the showand gutted that sky atlantic thought it ok to talk directly over it via their coming next on this channel voice over "
"282" "ACertainBang" 2012-05-29 " i am very puzzled by tywins misdirection to arya he would have had to go to great lengths to tee up the deception having a seperate meeting to arrange going to kings landing elsewhere and then a misleading meeting just for aryas benefit implies that he thinks of her very highly indeed curious to see what the fall out of this is hope we get some answers "
"283" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-05-29 " and who are you the proud lord saidthat i must bow so lowonly a cat of a different coatthats all the truth i knowin a coat of gold or a coat of reda lion still has clawsand mine are long and sharp my lordas long and sharp as yoursand so he spoke and so he spokethat lord of castamerebut now the rains weep oer his hallwith no one there to hearyes now the rains weep oer his halland not a soul to hear for the fear of you merry folk wandering off to places unknown and getting besieged by spoilers "
"284" "rickyredmanc" 2012-05-29 " ok thanks for putting me right "
"285" "JimTheFish" 2012-05-29 " but if you cant afford to do it right why do it because its central to the story theyve been telling and you cant seriously expect them to outdo lord of the rings on their budget besides its clear they had no intention of doing so anyway got is all about story an area where it has kicked the ass of the bloated tolkien movies already to berate it for lack of spectacle is kind of missing the point but having said that i think they acquitted themselves admirably anyway those were some of the finest battle scenes on any tv series i can think of "
"286" "UncertainAgain" 2012-05-29 " no that wasnt ser meryn it was ser mandon joffrey tells ser boros and ser mandon to stay and fight and represent the king i dont think we saw ser meryn the whole episode though it might have made more sense for him to swing the sword given his past animosity to tyrion they really only mentioned ser mandon by name once before perhaps last week i think just putting a name to the hit man i agree that ian beattie is doing a very good meryn and i hope that he doesnt fade into the background "
"287" "rickyredmanc" 2012-05-29 " yes it was a great episode however my only complaint is that meryn trants death at the hands of tyrions squire pod was all over too quick that was ser meryn yes  cant be 100 about it because of the helmet anyway i would of liked to have seen a longer protracted end for ser meryn it was all over too soon for my liking to finish i would like to congratulate actor ian beattie for his fantastic portrayal of the odious ser meryn "
"288" "SmokyBarnable" 2012-05-29 " best thing ive seen on telly for years season 2 kicks into gear at last worth the wait though "
"289" "ACertainBang" 2012-05-29 " hell yes just what we needed from the show awesome pyrotechnics and realistic reactions to battle from all players i was so confused as to who to root for on the one hand theres tyrion and tywin but theyre sided with joffers and cersei on the other there is the boss that is stannis if only one side were cockney orcs and the other pasty elves it would be far less confusing and again amidst all the skull squishing boulders and overenthusiastic scalpings there were great little moments  varys was that a tear is his eye when he was going to tell tyrion about his unmanning i think he genuinely respects the new hand  tyrion slashed by a member of the kingsguard almost missed that one but another little puzzle that has been thrown in for us also cersei was incredible this episode i was terrified about who she was going to poison and how close she got to discovering shae and that last scene in the throne room had a eerie beauty to it so pleased with the all round praise this has been a brave show and i am pumped for next week and a rewatch or two "
"290" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-29 " some of us were very disappointed by the lord of the rings films  "
"291" "objectinspace" 2012-05-29 " not to begin an argument covered in last weeks blog all entitled to our opinions but i genuinely think this weeks installment could not have worked so well without the filler episode put in last week which established many of the character dynamics esp cersei which came out so strongly tonight plus any episode with dr quin medicine woman getting her kit off "
"292" "DCharlie" 2012-05-29 " and i can believe the dragons white walkers magic spells everything but can someone please tell me why the the inbred kids mother has blonde hair and dark eyebrows unrealistic it ruins the show "
"293" "DCharlie" 2012-05-29 " so this episode is the reason why weve only seen the dragons once and why nothing has happened in the previous 8 good to know what a disappointing season game of accents has just become another show "
"294" "objectinspace" 2012-05-29 " first up excellent episode with my book readers hat on i should be critical of perhaps one too many deviations but i think that is unfair weve all or i have had our standards raised unrealistically by lord of rings this was about as brilliant as tense and as epic as it can get on the small screen no chain and stannis  in fairness  shouldnt be leading the vanguard of his own army but understandable changes that worked fine special mention to lena hedley she is quite simply magnificent as cersei her mannerisms and characterisation have been stunning since episode 1 and reached a peak in this episode and last weeks dinklage has rightly got a lot of praise but hedley should challenging beating for me yes him for any best actor gongs going this year the throne scene with tommen was deeply moving even if it was ended by a slightly cheesy line from tywin what will we all do after next weeks finale "
"295" "SiccarPoint" 2012-05-29 " varys wanting nothing other than peace i think youre probably right varys clearly loves the game but hes a eunuch spymaster socially he has not the slightest chance of ever actually gaining the throne hes almost untouchable because of his network but he can never hope to win as such in so far as hes playing hes got to be acting as a proxy for interests of the realm his power comes from the establishment  hes basically just a really awesome civil servant he just wants stability in my mind so he can collect that juicy pension aka not getting his head cut off though im speculating and we should probably just wait and see "
"296" "TopTroll" 2012-05-29 " this is the problem  they story has suckered me in now and theyre real enough for me that i very much want tyrion to come out of the whole thing relatively unscathed which seems an unlikely request even as i write it  "
"297" "TopTroll" 2012-05-29 " i think the phrase youre looking for is is nobody going it touch that  "
"298" "TopTroll" 2012-05-29 " found the varystyrion scene rather touching too it almost made me believe what varys said to ned stark about wanting nothing other than peace and his own personal safety "
"299" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-29 " mirthin29 may 2012 1217ami have a feeling episode 10 is going to be a let down though too many stories to wrap up i have a feeling that they wont wrap up all of the stories that ended book 2 and bleed some of them to run into season 3    some characters disappear in the book and i think we may see more of what happened to keep the actors on screen    somewhat similar to how robb and jaime were treated this season    "
"300" "GW74" 2012-05-29 " so "
"301" "albeit27" 2012-05-29 " thats the truth of it aint it just weve kind of blessed for high quality epic fantasy in written form over the past few years and now on tv too what an hour of tv this one was "
"302" "Elspeth25" 2012-05-29 " yes in a nailbiting episode this scene actually got my heart racing a bit genuinely scary and a great contrast with the battle scenes danger was inside the walls as well as out "
"303" "RobertinLondon" 2012-05-29 " point taken on that although he did tell the mountain to keep her close in effect expanded on that theory though as said by someone else first is the fact that i bet tywin puts it all together when he realises arya isnt in kings landing and it isnt going to bode well for littlefinger "
"304" "Mirthin" 2012-05-29 " this is how you do it by focusing on kings landing instead of cutting between a dozen different stories this episode restored the drama that has been sadly lacking in season 2 i have a feeling episode 10 is going to be a let down though too many stories to wrap up heres hoping hbo gives the producers some more money and a few more episodes next season i mean really theyve made a fortune on dvd sales now spend some of it on the gawdamned wolves "
"305" "SmartyMcFly" 2012-05-29 " it may not have been sacked but it came pretty close to being fired "
"306" "GW74" 2012-05-29 " which specific episode of game of thrones has been horrid the season may have threatened to sink under the growing weight of its multiple storylines in your view but that does not constitute horrid the whole episode was dedicated to the sacking of a city in the episode i saw the city wasnt sacked "
"307" "TopTroll" 2012-05-29 " i am also convinced that syrio the sword master escaped and is alive and well i hope syrios alive too hes a definite favourite of mine just as good in the book the other minor character i like is jaqen hghar the one who killed those people for arya "

"315" "TopTroll" 2012-05-28 " was nice to see tyrion and bronn kiss and make up ever since that business after the killing of roberts bastards theyve seemed a bit dry with eachother does anybody else think cercei would have worked out who shae was if shed been given five more minutes "

"320" "SheriffFatman" 2012-05-28 " tyrion strolling up behind that bloke and taking his leg off at the knee marvellous werent there complaints last season when the books had tyrion genuinely experience war but the tv series had him accidentally clonked on the head by one of his own men and spending the battle unconscious at the time im sure people accused the tv writers of playing it for laughs but i think it was actually a deliberate modification to character development by shifting tyrions first real combat to this episode it emphasises and cements his transition from essentially a rich playboy to a leader of men im imagining or at least hoping that tywin will now grudgingly realise that his least favourite child is also the one most like him the good bits of him anyway  if he hasnt already "
"321" "Gen73" 2012-05-28 " awesome tv hour rory mc cann loved him since the porridge oats adverts he has a great smile  not that you will see him smile in this bronn  he can sing unchained melody flashback though loved the story of the nose the whole flaming arrow and saving the hound but can we have some gratuitous male nudity please i am getting bored with naked women did anyone else spend the whole time worrying that sansas wine was poisoned until i noticed cersi was drinking out of the same jug then i thought jim jones but glad i was wrong it was pointed out on other threads that the reason that the stannis army broke and ran that they thought loris was renlys ghost poor stannis you gotta feel sorry for the guy to get sooo close to victory and have it statched from your grasp tywin what an entrance but the episode was peter dinkages epicness he better not be dead also hope that davos is alive with the whole i may get blown clear not that anyone on tv dies from internal blast injuries ps i am also convinced that syrio the sword master escaped and is alive and well will be rewatching "
"322" "SmartyMcFly" 2012-05-28 " anyone else spot the doll that sansa was holding when the hound offered to take her home to winterfell  it was the one ned gave her back in s1 "
"323" "TopTroll" 2012-05-28 " is it just me or is it getting a bit spoilery round here thats actually a genuine question i havent read a few of the posts because they looked as though they were going to tell me something about the second book or something about next weeks episode or worse safe to read or not "
"324" "5432Hun" 2012-05-28 " is there anyway that he might of suspected he had a spy in his midst perhaps a cupbearer of noble birth so he thought he would feed some misinformation to see what came out in the wash unlikely i think first arya is much too valuable to leave at harrenhall if he knew who she was shed be locked in a room with a 24 hour guard second the only way for arya to get a message out of harrenhall is either by raven which presumably he has someone keeping a very close eye on or by her escaping as hes not aware of her arrangement with jaqen escaping itself is enormously unlikely but then she would have to somehow finding her way to robb or any other allies before he gets to kings landing so i dont think its a question of tywin misinforming arya but rather the writers throwing a neat dummy on the viewers "
"325" "testure" 2012-05-28 " one more point probably doesnt mean anything but thought someone might comment on the previously on game of thrones bit at the start it showed tywin saying that he was going to ride through the night that scene gave the distinct impression at the time that he was going to go and kick robbs ass not ride to kings landing i might have added on a ridiculously speedy horse but have learned to accept that in the tv series you have to gloss over the distances the characters seem to cover is there anyway that he might of suspected he had a spy in his midst perhaps a cupbearer of noble birth so he thought he would feed some misinformation to see what came out in the wash on the strength of what weve seen in the show you probably couldnt rule this out at all to be honest as you suggest stannis was 2 days away and tywin who is mr purposeful was being very purposeful in the book this approach is a nono considering everyone including tywin is pretty much galavanting around somewhere for quite some time random appearances become less surprising in this context the other thing to consider is that the partnership with between the tyrells specifically those exrenly chaps who didnt go across to stannis and the lannisters is the background work of littlefinger as someone has already pointed out here the meeting between littlefinger and tywin could suggest this gameplan was tied up earlier than we might have thought and the scene was pregnant with tension thanks to aryas presence soin the context of the show i would say this is completely viable but it could just as easily never be mentioned again but its interesting its got me thinking now "
"326" "RobertinLondon" 2012-05-28 " i thought something similar that would make sense though he might also then have it in for littlefinger as he will know that he would have recognised arya when he visited him could get interesting "
"327" "JDKoopa" 2012-05-28 " interested to read other peoples take on stannis that hes either boring or insane stannis was one of my favourite characters in the books and certainly the one id love to be a pov character i suppose his single mindedness is a mind of madness in the sense that i was never convinced he ever really wanted to be king through any sense of ambition more that the rules state the crown should pass to him so he must follow the rules to the letter im sure theres a big part of him that still thinks the crown belongs to the targaryans anyway after a slightly shaky start i think stephen dillaine has nailed stannis and im looking forward to seeing him regroup next year "
"328" "simonw91" 2012-05-28 " also as were deviating a little from the books in the arya storyline does anyone think tywin will notice a distinct reduction in stark girls and the odd coincidence of a little northern highborn girl as his cupbearer "
"329" "simonw91" 2012-05-28 " if this show hasnt been getting awards yet this was the episode that confirmed that it should be not just for the sheer spectacle of blackwater but the acting was superb martins writing was sharper than its been in the books for a little while i know hes going over old ground but by the old gods and the new he does dialogue well i think that valar morghulis might actually be let off the hook by not needing to be the big climactic finale now all it needs to do is tee up the storm of swords series  the setting up will require some very memorable scenes believe me  and just a little aftermath of blackwater to go over "

"335" "RobertinLondon" 2012-05-28 " omg what an episode amazing easily the best this series and probably the only ep on a par with it at all is the episode where ned bought it last season the hound sansa and cersei were amazing i havent commented for a couple of weeks but the first thing i did after this one finished was run and grab the laptop to read what other people thought just about to rewatch it again already love doing that after ive read comments as there are always bits that i have missed i defo think sansa is staying in kings landing though someone else already said it but i think she thought stannis was a shoe in for a victory she might regret not going with sandor now though great entrance at the end but im a massive stark fan fing tywin those that are doubting  the hound would bust bronn up big time bronn could probably cut him five times and then sandor would just chop him in half this is with the caveat that they would fight on a very wet day where nothing or no one could light a fire sarah i love this blog and the fact that you obviously love the series and the books so much one criticism this week though how on earth was this only an hour of nearly perfect television "
"336" "UnclePhaester" 2012-05-28 " sarahsei has finally crossed the line i was working late today and so set tonights episode to record i finished it at 1030 instead of 1010 then logged onto cif only to discover that shed not waited the extra 20 mins for me before starting the blog if i could get my hands on her id do a tywintyrion on her and move a jug of iced brooklyn coffee out of her reach "
"337" "testure" 2012-05-28 " i heard the hound won the poolsbut he burned his coupon yes that was an utterly beezer episode if the battle of the blackwater rush was fudged i think all of season 2 would be compromised remember how history boffins dads and fans of hbos rome were so looking forward to actium in season 2 remember what we got instead no such worries here i thought perhaps after the mahoosive conflagration the battle would there endeth so it was terrific to have the resurgent efforts of steelyeyed steelywilled steely willied probably stannis take us into round two a move that sealed the commitment to bring the blackwater to life in its semiprotracted glory ive really enjoyed this series but was there a background sense that game of thrones was beginning to bewilder what you could call a mainstream audience becoming something of a shifting talkie wilful curio pushed on by zealous fans and losing its objectivity with norms well maybe it was and maybe thats exactly what it should be if it aims to do the books justice but here we seem to have a cinematic episode with the strength to capitalise on its many supposedly promising strands the use of supposedly there with inverted commas was to emulate the cynics i think its fair to say this one gorged the senses far more than it fed into the nerdy lore tableau and im not against the nerdy lore tableau quite the opposite rains of castamere aside referential nods were perhaps at their lowest ever in this instalment which is perhaps one of the ironic strengths of having martin script he sticks to the core narrative giving a kind of verbatim quality to the structure of the battle of course it is compromised it had to be but the structure at least is a satisfying lift and its an hour of television that teems with grace notes some recognisable others are new and inspired its unquestionably the helms deep of the season dealing out nostalgia and the prestige of large scale setpieces to fans of peter jacksons movies while maintaining a cool subverting cache with the people who would rather see a hobbit raped andor kicked in the face i would venture both camps would be happy with what has been offered here the focus of a single setting here has to be the defining success of this episode and it would be great to see the production do this more often like say for example doctor who has 2 double episodes per series it would be great if got could further its own focus by having two disparate episodes per season quite apart in the schedules which would each commit to never leave a single location i think it would diminish the sometimes tooscattered feel of the show and really recreate the experience of reading two or three chapters of the book while vying for a fitful chunk of its detail and pace "
"338" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-28 " i thought he shut the door and she stayed but i could be wrong  i would have to rematch the scene in less of a note taking frenzy "
"339" "pickershillPirate" 2012-05-28 " just when i was getting worried at the lack of raunch tyrion saves the day by ambushing stannis mud gate from behind bravo ser "
"340" "TopTroll" 2012-05-28 " sure it is by this point hes already persuaded everybody both that they like him and that theyre going to fight its like when a comedian does string of great jokes and then tells a slightly weaker one  everybody still feels well disposed enough towards them to laugh "
"341" "UnclePhaester" 2012-05-28 " guess peter dinklage has it in his contract that he wont spend the rest of his time on the show with only half a face    and no mention that it was a gold cloak who chibbed him up a treat    no even more interesting it was one of the kingsguard now who told him to go for tyrion "
"342" "Pillowhead" 2012-05-28 " well i think dinklage may well have secured himself another emmy off that absolutely perfectly played by him some great moments of comedy the lancel tell the hound to tell the king bit and then the half man chant followed by the oh f me some real horror at what he has done when the wildfire goes up a lovely little one to one with varys and then finally taking the bull by the horn and leading the charge fantastic stuff special mention to stannis though total badass led the attack himself without even wearing a helmet in stark boom boom contrast to that snivelling whelp joffrey great stuff from rory mccann as well absolutely nailed it "
"343" "richholt" 2012-05-28 " oh well good although in that case i feel stannis would want me to mutter in a sullen sort of tone something about the incorrect usage of dealbreaker which means that which makes the dealbusiness arrangementromantic evening out unworkable rather than a necessary condition for said dealbusiness arrangementromantic evening out "

"345" "natzandtheratz" 2012-05-28 " so disappointed when sky did a voiceover on top of the rains of castamere fortunately it didnt detract too much from an otherwise flawless episode "
"346" "miapatrick" 2012-05-28 " maybe the rest of the speech roused them sufficiently and he just had to get to the end pointing out the consequences of losing probably was enougha better ending your wives hell rape and thats right now not oh about five years down the line the way jeoffreys going  "
"347" "Luckyfiver" 2012-05-28 " yep totally ruined it and sky couldnt care less "
"348" "WidelyRed" 2012-05-28 " pillowhead28 may 2012 1039pm oh ok thanks my bad and apologies it just read as if had i looked at the lyrics id find spoilers and i feared that if i wanted to watch the episode again id have to cover my ears for the song very glad youve cleared that up "
"349" "Drewv" 2012-05-28 " i found it rather sweet and human he had done his best at a rousing speech and was now running low on a way to finish big and that was all he could think of at short notice perfectly believable it is absolutely believable that he couldnt think of a strong finish but it is not believable that this weak finish actually roused the men the way it did "
"350" "miapatrick" 2012-05-28 " its better then for joffrey westeros and the seven gods hed have lost them at jofferyhe is clearly improvising he never intended to lead the men in this way because a it was the kings job and b his sum total of battle experience is a premature concussion i find it quite realistic as a speach nicely balancing the green fire earlier on its a fantasy tv show but what makes it a serious drama is the realism of the characters thats why i like this and i didnt like legend of the seeker "
"351" "Spacedone" 2012-05-28 " the one thing that annoyed me about the episode was how they kept cutting away to the throne room door it was pretty much telegraphing what was going to happen in the scene "
"352" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-28 " singist28 may 2012 1001pmresponse to benjyuk 28 may 2012 935pmthe first time i watched the wildfire apocalypse i shat myself the second time i vomited into a conveniently placed yet slightly overflowing vomit barrel at least i hoped that that was all was in it    liked tyrion doing exactly what he saw through varys doing    sheala sheila isnt it "
"353" "singist" 2012-05-28 " i think you majorly misunderstood me just to reiterate from henceforth i will only go out with people who have a stannis badass rating or above "
"354" "Spacedone" 2012-05-28 " invest in a horns section too "
"355" "MaurizioGaudino" 2012-05-28 " great episode would have liked to see the chain and tywin dressed as renly as in the book but impressive stuff nonetheless it was the ninth episode of the first series where ned died it seems got likes its penultimate episodes "
"356" "sunnyone" 2012-05-28 " ooh that was just great fabulous episode i thought they got everything right like others have said well one or two people anyway i actually started to like lancel and shae and stannis and have definitely fallen for pod i was soooo pleased that bronn got to be the one who fired the first flaming arrow into the wildfire just like the spanish archer starting the barcelona olympics except hes supposed to have missed oh but wasnt it all dark i was peering desperately at the screen trying not to miss anything super cant believe next week is the last ep id like it to go on all summer "
"357" "tlsmith63" 2012-05-28 " that was an amazing episode it kind of reminded me of some of babylon 5s best episodes in a way cerseis speech intercut with scenes of the battle towards the end was reminiscent of the b5 style i always love peter dinklage as tyrion  but i also thought lena headey cersei was great in this episode its too bad that we only have one more episode left this season i have really enjoyed got "
"358" "camjm24" 2012-05-28 " bloody hell that was tv at its best "
"359" "Pillowhead" 2012-05-28 " no what people are telling you is that if you search it and read the wiki page you will see the mother of all spoilers nothing to do with the detail of the song that does not reflect future events "
"360" "Drewv" 2012-05-28 " but maybe that was the point hes very clever giving an inspirational speech he repressed his natural instinct to say something very clever and said something you can imagine printed on teeshirts in the next few weeks so rather then come across obnoxious to a large group of people who he needed very much to do what he said and didnt really like him very much to begin with he just went basic and chantable yes but it is the rest of his speech which accomplishes those things you describe there he cuts through the grand militaristic bs by being honest and appealing to the mens baser instincts  the crude desire to protect ones own home the last line itself is actually a weak ending to a strong speech and it really does not work as a serious battlecry in a serious drama "
"361" "dirtysexylibertine" 2012-05-28 " i dont think a night in the world of tv ever took so long and was so eventful "
"362" "Frances56" 2012-05-28 " great episodeone of the best things was how well they captured tyrions horror at the scope of what his trick had done hundreds of people burned to death at once and it was his doing tyrion plays cynical but hes one of the few people with genuine human empathy in the showpeter dinklage captured it like a boss if i ever had to put an army together 13 of my war budget would just go to drums "
"363" "Spacedone" 2012-05-28 " my impression was that shed decided to go with him she said you wont hurt me and then sandor opened the door and the scene cut ive been wondering for a while how they were going to pull off the battle of blackwater and that wildfire explosion was a very very satisfying scene i also wonder what they were going to do about tyrion understandable i think they lessened the damage i agree that they could have made this a double episode to increase the epicness but thisll do d "
"364" "MoreTears" 2012-05-28 " that was an option just skip the whole thing make the entire episode about cersei getting drunk and being catty with a battered and bloodied soldier stumbling into the room occasionally to give a report of what is going on i guess that would have made you happy everyone else in the world who watched prefers that they did it they way they did it "
"365" "FormicaAtomica" 2012-05-28 " ive now watched tywins entrance 4 times better than in the book going for a 5th time "
"366" "FormicaAtomica" 2012-05-28 " that would be too much "
"367" "richholt" 2012-05-28 " speak for yourself personally i no longer have any sympathy for any inhabitants of westeros who wouldnt want as their king the lunatic who acknowledges that the losses in scaling the walls will be immense then leads the charge himself helmetless and shieldless first over the top murdering as he goes until finally he has to be dragged away screaming that the fight must continue great fun  real oldfashioned corker of a battle scene band of brothers is the wrong comparison really since its battles are deliberately confusing stressful and ruled by noise this was the kind of battle i havent seen on tv since sharpe sometimes the geography seemed a bit odd good job stannis reinforcements were all hanging out behind that corner waiting for tyrion to overturn the ram but i had a whale of a time hopefully this gave marshall some inspiration for the future "
"368" "TopTroll" 2012-05-28 " i found it rather sweet and human he had done his best at a rousing speech and was now running low on a way to finish big and that was all he could think of at short notice perfectly believable "
"369" "winston4" 2012-05-28 " bronn definitely they might both die but i dont think so i sort of thought that was why the hound left since at some point hell have to fight bronn and he saw that that would be the day he dies speaking of that what happened to him anyway "
"370" "WidelyRed" 2012-05-28 " ive not read the books but surely the song is based on past events if it is to gradually dawn on us that history is repeating itself this is a device used by the author not spoilers however by telling us at this stage that the song also predicts future events you are creating spoilers "
"371" "roo640" 2012-05-28 " the rains of castamere was great  its nice to see it making an appearance so early in the series its a song to remember especially with the return of tywin to kings landing "
"372" "MoreTears" 2012-05-28 " no it doesnt fall flat why because in serious drama there is a certain relationship between characters and the way they speak and the line fit tyrion perfectly in a shakespeare play yeah it would have fallen flat "
"373" "valeria" 2012-05-28 " if youve got sky at home you can watch it on the internet wherever you are just go to the sky site or ring em up believe me you dont want to miss this one "

"375" "TopTroll" 2012-05-28 " but one of the main things that is increasingly bringing me back to the show is the growing desire to see joffrey getting his comeuppance the little shit i love the scenes with joffrey hes just so perfectly unlikeable but also creative enough that you cant tell what horrible thing hell think to do next in fact all i find all the lannisters hugely entertaining to watch theres always panache behind the unpleasantness "
"376" "rooksx" 2012-05-28 " sure i get that theyre limited by a tv budget but if you cant afford to do it right why do it "
"377" "Clariana" 2012-05-28 " i liked that the pyromancer was virtually dribbling from his toothless mouth pyromancer  pyromaniac "
"378" "lmsava" 2012-05-28 " there wasnt i guess it would also have been very uncomfortable to ask 42 yearold rory mccann to share a kiss with 15 yearold sophie turner "
"379" "MoreTears" 2012-05-28 " yeah i have heard of people giving up on the pacific because the early episodes looked unpromising to them episodes 4 through 6 deal with the battle of peleliu if you are a fan of battle scenes made for the screen you have to find a way to see the battle of peleliu done for the pacific in real life there were over 12000 men killed with over 8000 wounded or missing and the pacific made that level of carnage utterly believable "
"380" "JamesH91" 2012-05-28 " also you know how in pulp fiction jules has a wallet that says bad mother fucker on it tywin lannister has one of those "
"381" "FormicaAtomica" 2012-05-28 " best episode yer sandor sansa fans may be dissapointed there wasnt a kiss wasnt there in the books cant remember properly "
"382" "Drewv" 2012-05-28 " these are brave men knocking at our door lets go kill them dont understand why people think this is such a great line there is cleverness in the contrast of the unexpectedly blunt and matteroffact second part but it is a smartass south park sort of cleverness in a serious drama it falls flat "
"383" "JamesH91" 2012-05-28 " that was really quite something outstanding performances across the board especially leda headey who had her finest hour so far and jack gleeson who somehow make joffrey sympathetic and human for a very brief period the nationals version of the rains of castamere for those who liked it httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvsn2l2v6ur8featureplayerembedded also the wildfire explosion money shot was stunning "
"384" "CharlieBronze" 2012-05-28 " t  insert where appropriate "
"385" "lmsava" 2012-05-28 " that was well worth waiting for i loved how all the valour and bravado was undercut with the genuine fear and terror that must go through everyone involved in war i loved the look on tyrion and the hounds faces as they saw the result of the wildfire the horror of what they were looking at overwhelmed any sense of triumph that they might have had at seeing stannis fleet destroyed plus this was the first episode where ive actually cared about stannis the series has done a pretty terrible job of getting us invested in stannis up to now so i was worried that the battle would be anticlimactic since the stakes were low for viewers it was great writing to turn that around so quickly it was good to finally see some real development of the hound as well his character has been absolutely gutted so far which is unfortunate because he has an interesting journey "
"386" "TopTroll" 2012-05-28 " these are brave men knocking at our door lets go kill them ah tyrion has such a way with words hopefully hell survive and tywin will respect him more for his well earned battle scars "

"389" "CharlieBronze" 2012-05-28 " i cant remember why but i gave up on the pacific after three episodes so you may be right and i may have to give it another shot in band of brothers the terror of the forest artillery bombardment in the bastogne episode and the assault on the town where spiers takes control of the company were fantasically realised "
"390" "MZorin" 2012-05-28 " so sansa definitely didnt go with sandor i thought they left us hanging "

"392" "MoreTears" 2012-05-28 " are you for real didnt stand out from any number of movie battle scenes the whole point is that this is tv and they did what they did on a tv budget albeit an hbo one sorry they didnt have a 100 million to spend on a battle like lotr did so that they might have stood a chance of impressing you "
"393" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-28 " yes for me this series is second only to band of brothers "
"394" "MoreTears" 2012-05-28 " if you think band of brothers is tops when it comes to tv battle scenes you obviously have never seen what is essentially bobs companion series the pacific sure the pacific is a cut below bob because of character and plot reasons but the battle scenes in the pacific put everything else that have ever been done in the way of warfare on tv to shame and with a budget of 230 million for ten episodes it is understandable why that was more than double the budget of bob and would cover four seasons  or forty episodes  of game of thrones "
"395" "Drewv" 2012-05-28 " that was the idea but they got it wrong he got the arrow in his right side but cersei hits him on his left side continuity error "
"396" "rooksx" 2012-05-28 " the one thing ive felt this show has been missing is action there were several occasions when it was obvious that there was meant to be a battle scene but all we see is the aftermath after this episode i think its best that the crew stick to talky drama as they clearly dont know how to direct action despite the gory violence the battle was pretty humdrum and didnt stand out from any number of movie battle scenes it certainly wasnt a patch on any of the lord of rings setpieces or red cliff fortunately lena heady was absolutely superb peter dinklage was great as usual but headys exhibition of drunken rambling contempt followed by motherly tenderness was excellent "
"397" "Elspeth25" 2012-05-28 " tyrion ser lancel tell the hound to tell the king that the hand is extremely busy lancel the hand of the king would like you to tell the king and so on bless lancel he doesnt have a clue does he has to be one of the funniest scenes in the seriesthat it was so closely followed by the holy crap reaction of the wildfire explosion just underlines quite how briliant this episode and actually the whole series is "
"398" "SiccarPoint" 2012-05-28 " in his defense didnt cercei punch him right where his wound was though agree it wasnt totally obvious why he went down like a sack of potatoes "

"400" "CharlieBronze" 2012-05-28 " kaboom band of brothers is still the television ne plus ultra when it comes to battle scenes but that was all kinds of awesome stannis was fucking fierce no lightbringer though deliberate or did the producers drop a bollock there a favourite character was also missing as loras took his role in the battle i really hope hes in the next series even if he is only a peripheral character "

"405" "Drewv" 2012-05-28 " i know its not going to happen but i want tywin to seize the throne of westeros the man just screams king surely the central point of got  or in least in my reading of the series  is that it does not matter who sits on the throne all the pretenders are blueblooded arseholes  human and rounded charatcers but arseholes all the same stannis is more mad than the rest of them sure but we are merely talking degrees there every single war is horrific a point well underlined by the reviewer and the people suffer regardless of which way the tides turn the wildfire explosion reminded me of nothing so much as daisy cutters dropped by america on iraq and afganistan if i lived in this world i would be looking to start some sort of peasant rebellion do a french revolution on the nobility in the best case play robin hood guerilla games against them in the worst what a bunch of arseholes "

"413" "guardiansek" 2012-05-28 " great episode tyrion makes a gallant effort at saving the city and then gets his cliffhanger is he dead injury at the hands of the head of the kingsguard of course we all know it was practically cersei swinging that sword to take her brother with her to the grave in defeat or remove him from the postvictory maneuvering for control cersei was great being the brittle wineswilling tower of will that she is shes obviously a woman who has stared into the abyss enough that her quest for power is her only defense against it and therefore her only reason for living sandor cleganethe hounds pyrophobia was well handled exposing his limits without being a showy look at me moment stannis was really good as the singleminded warrior davos seaworth was his usual enjoyable and laconic self in his brief time onscreen before he became this episodes other cliffhanger joffrey had his moment with his nonshowy resignation to cowardice my only problem with this episode was sansa not leaving with sandor when she had the chance shes afraid of getting practically being reduced to a sex slave by the repugnant joffrey she hates and fears cersei shes a hostage of war she might get gangraped if stannis army winsand she turns down an offer of escape with a man who has proven in past episodes that he will protect her and is one of the fiercest warriors in existence as long as fire is not involved with the exception that it wouldnt exactly be a laughaminute buddy road movie sandor is about the best traveling companion that a woman could ask for in the middle of a war what is she hanging onto in kings landing her refusal to leave made no sense to me other than that we wont be seeing tyrion and davos next episode which is a bit of a downer but peter dinklage needed some time to work on that cabinet to hold this years crop of awards anyway "

"424" "SiccarPoint" 2012-05-28 " wildfire thank goodness it was green and eerie looking the in retrospect masterful trailers for this episode had got me thinking theyd wussed out and just made it look like regular fire but no boooooooooooom i think the pyromancer thought all his christmases had come at once so many good moments highlights for me were 1 sansa being devastatingly politebutactuallywantsyoudead telling tyrion she wants him to live just as much as the king ouch2 bronn and clegane telling each other how badass they are then showing it the hound cutting several people actually in half and bronn moving faster than anyone jerome flynns age has any right to3 tryion having a succession of realisations that his day was only getting worse the remainder of the fleet still coming realising he had to lead the sortie and then after winning the skirmish at the gate realising they were still hopelessly outnumbered great acting work4 turns out one of the advantages of being a dwarf soldier is that people dont see you coming hope that guy didnt need that leg5 rains of castamere whooo and excellent spot by tafkajamie that that was what tyrion was whistling a couple of episodes ago6 finally loras appears to have done something impressive in a fight about time and more tywin right there at the end which is always great grade a episode i will be watching that again "
"425" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-28 " this must be a first    no mention of the scheduling of the blog    yet "
"426" "diegowesterberg" 2012-05-28 " the nationals version of the rains of castamere is an absolute dirge but i love that they went to the trouble of getting it made for the show dinklages speech before leading the men out was up there with mel gibson in braveheart and viggo mortenson in rotk rory mccann bossed it as the hound more screentime than the other 18 episodes put together probably and stole the show loras look when he took his helmet off was a great bit of acting graduated from hypedup kid with a sword to fullon warrior in one fluid motion i wish i could make wildfire nobody makes an entrance like charles dance so much i loved about that episode best 56 minutes of television ever "
"427" "Sunburst" 2012-05-28 " i havent pirated it yet see you tomorrow "
"428" "Sinequanone" 2012-05-28 " first i was go stannis then i was go tyrion awp as i think i mentioned before i didnt think the hound would be in the top three all mouth no class  bron rules as good with a bow or a dagger as he is with a sword "
"429" "jackman" 2012-05-28 " fantastic episode wonderful performances wonderful war wounds from the makeup and special effects crew from sliced faces to missing limbs to death by rock on noggin cersai  a lioness always protects her cubs despite sueellen ewing levels of wine consumption so where did varys hide himself during the battle i would bet wherever it was it was the safest place to be i hope next week is a stunner of an episode if it has to follow that "
"430" "ScotiaNova" 2012-05-28 " a few people seem to be puzzled by the hounds sudden quitting    his fear of fire has been well established just look at his coupon and the guy on fir that bron took out for him seems to have been the last lit straw   was cheering stannis on with his one man assault on kings landing although did get flashes for monty python during the first wave as soldiers attacked a battlement wall with their swords and also cheered when tywin came in on his big white horse   tyrions injuries dont look as life threatening as they could have    no one is panicing that theyve just killed off tyrion the lead at the end of episode 9    guess peter dinklage has it in his contract that he wont spend the rest of his time on the show with only half a face    and no mention that it was a gold cloak who chibbed him up a treat    "
"431" "aphrsk" 2012-05-28 " the uncaring look on stannis face when hes being told that hundreds will die during the siege is just priceless generally i must say im very impressed with stephen dillanes performance as stannis i remember i couldnt care less about the character in the books grr marting often described him as bland and uncharismatic and accordingly wrote him as such at it was personal impression here authors took a bit of a different approach fleshing out his mildly psychopathic side and it turned out just great at this point probably my favourite character its one of many subtle changes that make me love the show so much its not that the series rewrites characters but rather it seems to look at them at a slightly different angle  just as a perfect book adaptation should "
"432" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-28 " me too and then i stupidly watched the next two episodes of mad men and then i was a complete mess agree about marshall being a smart move it was very tightly directed and so tense "
"433" "SarahHughes" 2012-05-28 " dont sell yourself short i thought it was a pretty good pun about the key difference "
"434" "weewilkie" 2012-05-28 " and jerome was singing without robson it was a kind of unchained melody thats an awful pun about a difference between the book battle and the tv one "
"435" "dafnitin" 2012-05-28 " this is the first time i manage to watch the episode before the blog is out i have enjoyed reading all the comments in all previous blog episodes though  fantastic episode i was really looking forward to the wildfire destruction and even more so to seeing the hound finally show fear and joff soiling his pants from it and i wasnt disappointed i am really enjoying the parts in the show that werent in the book tooand great ending with the song by the always amazing national "
"436" "Ninnyhammer" 2012-05-28 " and once again a dwarf jumped behind enemy lines and stopped a gate from being breachedsimply magnificent episode "
"437" "TAFKAJamie" 2012-05-28 " glorious horrible episode and now we know what tyrion was whistling when he rolled into the small council meeting a few episodes ago not the harry potter theme as it turns out i suspect the bronnclegane notquiteashowdown was a little touch of grrms trademark audiencetrolling "
"438" "PhelimONeill" 2012-05-28 " very smart move getting marshall involved led to some nearspartacus levels of violence i wish more brit directors would do some tv an edgar wright directed doctor who would be interestingdrunk cersei was also great value and some classic lines from tyrion and the hound his rallying the troops by threatening their corpses was noveli watched this and the latest mad men one after the other hadnt felt that battered by television in a nice way in ages "
"439" "weewilkie" 2012-05-28 " that was a bit fantastic a bit special it lived up to all the hype just a bit people got a bit burned a bit blown away a bit sliced apart a bit head caved in a bit arrow or spear in the eye a bit gutted a bit throat slashed noone got a bit raped though never mind cercei you were a joy tonight as the lush old aunty  and in that beautiful scene of you and tommen sitting alone on the iron throne waiting to see who was to come through the door of the throne room and you didnt need to get a bit poisoned you were a bit relieved bring on the finale "
"440" "raysablade" 2012-05-28 " stunning absolutely stunning its going to be a bloody long winter "
"441" "ronty12" 2012-05-28 " never has truer words been spoken those are brave men knocking at our doorlets go kill them a near perfect concoction of war at its fiercest and the repercussions of it all "
"442" "MurrayOstril" 2012-05-28 " holy shit that was a great episode "
"443" "shellac" 2012-05-28 " after centurion i thought neil marshall was spent it really was ropey and duff but this was absolutely top of his game stuff about as good as tv can get "
"444" "diegowesterberg" 2012-05-28 " first perfect just perfect the balance of truetothebook and deviatingfromthebook could not have been better "
