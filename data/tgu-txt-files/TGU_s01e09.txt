"4" "avidfan" 2011-06-20 " great show excellent cast  as mentioned above i’d be very interested to know what arrangements have been made with regard to ad breaks – it’s the only thing on sky with only 1 or 2 in the whole length of the show – heaven all i do is record the show then start watching it a few minutes after it starts – then i’ve built up enough of a buffer to be able to fast forward the ads "

"6" "pintooo" 2011-06-18 " in the us people are willing to pay quite a bit of money for hbo because it offers mature high quality programming and uninterrupted shows if only we had something like that in the uk we used to before the beeb castrated itself some murdochtype will no doubt argue that this is the free market working when we used to have it for the masses rather than a select few "

"14" "WalkerboyUK" 2011-06-17 " weve definitely had more than one ad break in the uk episodes i record it on monday and tend to watch on wednesday or thursday and there has always been at least 2 if not 3 breaks per episode what made me chuckle the other week is that i ended up starting to watch the repeat later in the week despite having it recorded from the monday night however when it went to the first break i switched to my recording knowing i could whizz through the ads imagine my amazement that the ads were in a completely different place in the repeat  in fact the first was some 10 mins earlier than in the monday showing sky allocate 65 minutes for an episode of got of which according to the downloads i did last night only 55 mins are the show itselfthe repeat is allocated 75 minutes just checked  so 20 minutes of advertsthey did the same with sopranos except each episode is only 43 minutes we gave up on it because of the constant ads and nearly did the same with boardwalk empire "
"15" "numsi1981" 2011-06-17 " i wouldnt argue about it being an american show  but it is not a totally american show  for one thing the uk taxpayer has effectively subsidised the show via the tax breaks offered to the production to the tune of a few million a tax break is not a subsidy if the government decided to reduce the income tax rate for your income class temporarily you would not say that other tax payers are subsidizing you right when a firm gets a subsidy the government gives it money to do whatever it does produce a tv show in this case when a firm gets a tax break the government does not make the firm pay for what it does the goal might be similar but the means is completely different because one decreases the public budget and the other possible revenues cant we all just agree that it has been a great decision by an american producer to go with an english cast and shot the show partially in the uk  everything else is just technicalities "
"16" "ManofConstantSorrow" 2011-06-17 " regarding the use of british actors i think another thing to consider is that they are appearing more than ever as americans in american shows and one iof the reasons ive read for this is simply because they are cheaper and often less difficult then american actors that point had occurred to me as well i dare say that peter vaughn has a great deal less demands about onsite catering and the like than a similar eminence gris of american acting no part yet though for phil davis which is shurely shome mishtake  it also occurs to me that for some reason american tv and film execs attach more gravitas to english actors than they do american ones no idea why perhaps theyve never watched will mellor but the evidence is there all around us "
"17" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-17 " moretears i wouldnt argue about it being an american show  but it is not a totally american show  for one thing the uk taxpayer has effectively subsidised the show via the tax breaks offered to the production to the tune of a few million the use of uk actors as has been mentioned before was due to issues of work permits  a case can be put for the use of some nonresident actors as with momoa  dinklage but the majority would need to be resident here at least that is my understanding  actors from the eu on the other hand would be able to walk into roles "

"19" "MoreTears" 2011-06-17 " articulateghost i think i read somewhere that hbo comes as a package of seven different channels "
"20" "ArticulateGhost" 2011-06-17 " wow i didnt even consider the time difference in america if they broadcasted it live it would be on at a ridiculous time in americaim stupid sometimes  "
"21" "ArticulateGhost" 2011-06-17 "  more tearsit seems i was more than a little wrongsky is more expensive but they offer a plethora of channels i think although i cant be sure they offer a lot more than hbo however im probably wrong "
"22" "reverber8" 2011-06-17 " when a friend raved about this new hbo fantasy series by a certain mr dunnodontcare my initial reaction was to do a forrest gump run forrest run now i cant miss an episode kudos to hbo for an extraordinary achievement a fantasy series in which the production values the writing and the acting are all of equally high standard i hope they can keep up the momentum killing off what has been until now the central character of the show is nothing short of brilliant daring its all the more impressive when you realise that the story has been quietly and steadily building up other equally interesting characters to fill in the ensuing vacuum the brilliant tyrion gets ever most intriguing jon and robb are emerging as potentially conflicting compelling moral dilemmas and the two young stark women are heartbreaking to watch at the beginning of the series the dothraki scenes were giving off a bilious whiff of xena but i have to admit that they are getting better with each passing episode a considerable feat of storytelling considering that 9 episodes in daenrys has yet to even meet any of the other major characters across the narrow sea i await what happens next with bated breath ironic that it takes a fantasy series to give us a more real more gritty vision of medieval politics than most other highminded quasihistorical epics out there "
"23" "leroysunshine" 2011-06-17 " not sure id have stuck with the show if the accents were all american it just seems that for some genres the british accent works better than any other same here american actors fine but an american accent whilst in a medieval setting based somewhat on the war of the roses and wearing a suit of armour just doesnt work imo blame kevin costner in robin hood prince of thieves  "
"24" "MoreTears" 2011-06-16 " articulateghost  johndear hbo shows game of thrones on sunday nights in america and hbo doesnt have less ads it has no ads at all  just like the bbc and unlike sky and i doubt that hbo has less variety compared to cost than sky and depending on where one lives in the us an hbo subscription is between 10 and 15 per month so 6 to 10 pounds isnt a sky subscription more than that per month "
"25" "JohnDear" 2011-06-16 " i thought it was because they broadcast it live or at the same time as hbo therefore are restricted to the same amount of ads that hbo use is that true isnt it shown on sunday evenings on hbo and monday on sky it certainly appears on p2p before its shown in the uk "
"26" "ArticulateGhost" 2011-06-16 " walkerboyuki thought it was because they broadcast it live or at the same time as hbo therefore are restricted to the same amount of ads that hbo usehbo is a subscription channel and therefore relies less on advertising for capital as opposed to other channelsi know sky is a subscription but hbo offers less variety in comparison to cost i believe sort of guessingthere has been one ad in every single episode of the season for game of thrones compared to about 5 in a single episode of the sopranos "
"27" "hyperion30000" 2011-06-16 "  walkerboyuk interesting point on accents however as dallas texas citizen i find just the opposite to be true i could easily distinguish the accent of someone from seattle versus someone from san antonio or mobile i cannot distinguish between the northern and southern british accents that uk commenters are referring to here as for what is more appropriate sounding for fantasy i guess it is largely dependent on what one is used to american accents would work just fine for me and possibly be less distracting the reverse may be true for citizens of the uk "
"28" "macster" 2011-06-16 " candylilacs  they probably are but theres just too many issues with getting noneu actors in  work permits tax reasons union rules it seems like the casting team are only going to go through all that red tape for special cases like peter dinklage as long as theres a strong pool of european actors available for the roles its exceptionally unlikely american actors will be cast "
"29" "candylilacs" 2011-06-16 " sarahhughes id say about a decade ago that was true i noticed that british and canadian shows they had unique even oddlooking people on them but now canadian programs like degrassi and most of the things i see on bbc america look like they have us casting agents lots of teeth bleaching straightening waxing boob jobs and expensive highlights i wont even go into the tanning i mean cersei daenarys viserys jaime jon snow arya sansa and bran would all make the us transition easy lena headey already has been in several us projects sansa is pretty glossy already but they would make her dye her red hair blonde there are plenty of american actors with crooked teeth and bad skin they usually just dont get lead roles steve buscemi excluded i think the filming in n ireland probably had some kinds of caveats tied to tax exemptions  you must have x many british actors to get these tax breaks that makes sense however there are millions of actors in the us who could probably act just as well or at least as well as aiden gillens somnambulant littlefinger ill stare talk in a nasal monotone pause then stare again there are going to be people from different lands and it makes little sense for people to have british accents in what is a fantasyesque asia minor or north africa they could easily be introduced or they can all do some other accent either way id like to think the producers are open to actors other than europeans especially for some of the roles of lets say a character from a different region not already introduced "
"30" "bluefairy" 2011-06-16 " ive been reading every blog for this series but this is the first time ive commented and wow wow wowwhat an episode that was there was loud gasp and then stunned silence from both myself and my boyfriend when ned was beheaded both of us as nonbook readers saw a dodgy ending for good old sean bean but never expected that little shit joffry to go against the deal cersei had made my boyfriend is mightily upset that sean bean is gone but i think as others have said this is a real turning point in the storythe shit is literally going to hit the fan actually most of the series we have been saying to each other that ned although hes an honourable man he really is out of place at kings landing with all that scheming going on we are wondering if whats coming from the north is going to be far far worse than anything a civil war will bring as someone has already mentioned go back and watch the reactions during the beheading scene  amazing acting on the part of everyone the shock on cerseis face sansa distraught joffry and littlefinger smug with varys moving to face joffry looking like he was pleading for neds life thanks to the people for explaining how jaime was captured we were a bit puzzled by that one absolutely love peter dinklage and there are rumours he is going to be up for an emmy i havent wanted to read up around it too much as i wanted to avoid spoilers and they seem to creep into the most unexpected things roll on the finale next week  i just cant imagine whats in store ive managed to hold off from reading the books so far but they are lined up on my kindle ready to go once ive watched next weeks episode "
"31" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-16 " walkerboyuk  id heard that was a problem my parents stopped watching boardwalk empire despite enjoying it because of the amount of ad breaks i think its a real shame with shows coming from us cable because they have no ad breaks and are structured to run as such "
"32" "MoreTears" 2011-06-16 " smartymcfly got is totally american in the sense that hbo does not have an international coproducer for the show a totally american production can still film outside the us and employ nonamericans "
"33" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-16 " cornerswell  i wouldnt describe got as a totally american show  it was filmed predominantly in the uk plus malta with predominantly uk actors sets  design etc constructed by mostly uk companies  with pretty hefty uk tax benefits for filming here in northern ireland sarahhughes  lol  yup i guess there is generally a less than perfect dental aesthetic here  although jaimes  costerwaldaus hair is a little too timotei for me "
"34" "WalkerboyUK" 2011-06-16 " ive just remembered one of the things that made this weeks episode better only one advert break have sky been bollocked about the amount of adverts theyve put into the programming on sky atlanticseems to be that a lot of shows on there that had breaks every 15 mins have had a serious reduction in the last week or so regarding accents to me a british accent is easily distinguishable when separating out about north south etc whereas in the us i find it a lot harder unless its east coast vs west coast even then its only the nynj drawl thats the obvious one not sure id have stuck with the show if the accents were all american it just seems that for some genres the british accent works better than any other "
"35" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-16 " hypernion3000  i honestly think that the largely british cast is due to the decision to film in ireland and malta there are all manner of permit issues etc which probably limits american actors once thats decided also i would add that one useful thing about casting brits is that theyre a little less perfect looking less plucked and waxed and more ragged round the edges which i think helps here my father was utterly obsessed in troy with the fact that you could see that brad pitt had his nasal hairs waxed in addition to everything else while sean bean and peter otoole continued to display their array of chest hair and bad teeth respectively  "
"36" "Pillowhead" 2011-06-16 " cornerswell im not a fantasy fan normally but i devoured the first two books in about 3 weeks and am now on the third i think that people can get a bit hung up on genres if a storys entertaining then it doesnt matter where its set its the themes and characters that are important for example i was really sniffy about watching the battlestar galactica remake for ages because i dont really like sci fi but after much lobbying from my friends gave it a chance and loved it for the same reasons as i like got good story and interesting characters which could be just as relevant in any setting "
"37" "MoreTears" 2011-06-16 " cornerswell if the decision had been made that on westeros one particular kind of accent would be normal and given the part of the world the filming was being done in america is not abundant in medievaltype architecture why not go with a mostly british cast just seems practical "
"38" "cornerswell" 2011-06-16 " re accents until i looked him up online because he was so brilliant i thought the actor playing tyrion sounded german i do wonder why in totally american show they didnt put more us actors in it though "
"39" "cornerswell" 2011-06-16 " after next week i dont think im going to bear the wait until series 2 and although these arent the sort of books i would usually read am thinking of giving them a trybut i remember the horror of trying to wade through lord of the rings after seeing the films is the same experience in store for me with game of thrones or are the books more accessible for the nonfantasy fanclub reader "
"40" "Ephiny0" 2011-06-16 " i dont have any problems with american accents in fantasy modern englishbritish accents dont exactly belong to the medieval period either and anyway the whole point of fantasy is that it isnt set in our world or not our world as we know it so it doesnt have to be historically authentic i would have found it odd if tyrion had a dramatically different accent from his family and other people from his homeland though so it probably would have been a bit jarring if hed kept his american accent when the other actors are british i didnt even realise he was american when i first sawheard him so hes clearly not doing a bad job "
"41" "ChinofJim" 2011-06-16 " hyperion30000 i think you are wrong that the uk is not relevant to the fantasy world being portrayed the story if very obviouly inspired by the war of the roses which was a medieval civil war of succession for the english crown fought for by different families "
"42" "Tripper86" 2011-06-16 " yeah i dont really remember much of shaes character in the books here shes rather striking in appearance if not anything else for now i also think that a discussion of accents is pointless fantasy at least the more classical sort has to have an oldtimey feel american english actually every english other than british english doesnt have it it might have it if everyone starts using it now and that would be only after decades consistency though is the more important point "
"43" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-16 " on the accents  im not overly bothered to be honest the fact that the cast is predominantly uk actors is i think more to do with permits etc for working within the uk a special case was made for dinklage  momoa not really going to add to the spoiler topic other than to disagree with sunburst  there were undoubtedly spoilers dropped  by accident i think rather than malice with one exception hinting strongly or confirming the presence of characters in future books is a spoiler there does seem to be a backlash that is gathering pace  more so in the us than here  about the loss of bean from the show it seems a lot of viewers really werent expecting it  and the shock has given way to anger at removing the person perceived as the mainman  as many have said  it was like bumping tony soprano off before the end of s1 re shae  i think bw have done a better job than grrm she was fleshed out if youll excuse the pun a bit more in the tv show than in the book  i agree that they missed an opportunity to make her a bit more interesting but i dont think theyve dropped the ball completely with her  maybe things will improve "
"44" "Rosimir" 2011-06-16 " this is fantasy so accent shouldnt be a bar but perhaps the supposed sniggers that accompanied tony curtiss forays into medieval costume drama meant that those with american accents were doomed hyperion30000 to suggest that americans lack taste and intelligence is indeed a ridiculous and sweeping generalisation however i do take issue with the reference to more talented americans possibly filling the roles for me there is no more talented an ensemble than this almost perfect casting "
"45" "MoreTears" 2011-06-16 " tripper86 in battlestar galactica bamber was playing the son of a character played by an american you think it would be reasonable in a tv show to have a father and son speaking with two different accents in fact that is one of the problems with the new borgias series that is going to be starting on sky atlantic before too long jeremy irons plays his role with his normal british accent and the canadian actor playing his son uses his his generic north american accent it comes across as ridiculous "
"46" "pintooo" 2011-06-16 "  hyperion30000 to be fair ive found the whole discussion about accents quite dull just how northern the northrons should sound etc but the consistency is fine i do think that american accents would really confuse the whole thing though while it is certainly a story written by an american it is written on the traditions of the british isles but im already bored of this discussion so ill stop there while we brits may be snooty about american tastes i think enough of us here have applauded hbo for got as well as other great series such as rome in conjunction with the bbc thank you the sopranos and so on from personal experience i find watching tv is the us s souldestroying experience not only are the adverts interrupted by the occasional bit of programming but most channels are happy to churn out formulaic dross and repeats is british tv so much better maybe not but at least our ads are fewer and further apart "
"47" "Tripper86" 2011-06-16 " also jamie bamber had to fake an american accent on battlestar galactica whats up with that people british actors shouldnt be straightjacketed that way not fair  "
"48" "Tripper86" 2011-06-16 " secondaryworld fantasy not the harry potterpagemaster kind where the existence of our world is acknowledged is a literary genre that draws very particular parallels to the real world if got took place in a pseudo18th century world i wouldnt have any problem immersing myself in a world where people speak with american accents theres a difference between fantasy the fictional set of narrative and structural expectations and fantasy the wild ramblings of ones imagination where everything and anything goes got is not our worlds medieval time but has too much in common with it to ignore that "
"49" "candylilacs" 2011-06-16 " tripper86 its fantasy its not our worlds medievel time so accents can be whatever they want them to be  and im totally lobbying for american boxer holly holm to get a specific part in season two "
"50" "Tripper86" 2011-06-16 "  hyperion30000 accents have to do with convention i think fantasy take place in a pseudomedieval setting american or australian or canadian or south african accents dont belong to the medieval period also american accents at least the first 100 times they appear in fantasy will have an effect of massive dissociation with the fictional world i think that effect may persist even beyond that first 100 times and become a permanent feature of americanaccented fantasy if that takes root at some point might be a cool thing to experiment with somewhere else but got isnt exactly groundbreaking in terms of setting about the episode  awesome i really dont miss the battle scenes  not to mention that robbs battle isnt shown in the books either i personally liked how shae came across in the episode  served more as a foil to tyrion so her somewhat passive mysteriousness worked well i think its true that a character should have a memorable introduction but neither did bronn and he seems to be doing just fine d arya hugging yoren probably thinking of her fathers hugs was a very sad touch sophie turners reaction didnt impress me either should have underplayed it or she should have ratcheted up the horror to serve as a nice counterpoint to the silence and that shot of arya in the end that boy playing joffrey easily ranks with maisie williams as the best child actor in the series probably even better great prebattle sequence with tyrion hilarious  give a mustering speech in a gravelly voice get whacked on the head get stepped on a little too effective a rhetorician d also another overturning of heroic convention with robbs postbattle speech  more like a fuck me and all our heroics so what didnt sound like a speech at all more like a sobering blanket over the whole event "
"51" "Vestrit7" 2011-06-16 " to me a spoiler would be more along the lines of stannis baratheon wont show up before season 2 when he arrives on his iridescent floating octopus which slowly crawls up the eeyrie before sucking lysa inside itself where she transforms into a golden unicorn and gallops all the way to kings landing with robert on her back to impale joffrey on her glittering horn i cant believe you just ruined that for everyone "

"58" "numsi1981" 2011-06-15 " spoilers i can tell you about spoilers first time i didnt watch the episode on monday evening right after work knew it was a mistake so i went to the office on tuesday just to be drawn into a discussion with my colleague about got it started because he saw my desktop wallpaper which is the starks direwolf so i asked him where he is at expecting something like i saw the last episode which aired on sunday no no the answer i got was i saw the episode where they beheaded mr stark  who talks like that my first thought had something to do with a large sword and his head on a plate still it was very impressive stuff i was sitting there and could not believe what i just witnessed only then did i become really sad 1 i think joffrey got carried away by the whole setting the crowd the first time he feels the power he has and the accusations of ned about him not being the rightful heir of the throne the exact opposite of what he heard all of his life when you see him standing there 5405 to be exact like a complete dick with that smeary smile of his you know that he is only in the moment and not foreseeing the whole consequences of what he just did i just hope for an end for joffrey that involves arya needle and nymeria 2 as much as i love the show i really had it the first time that i found something weak which was the big jump to the capture of jaime i do not need a big cgi battlescene but rob riding out of the woods together with 50 men was really underwhelming equally as much as i laughed about tyrion being knocked out before the battle even started another route probably something like in the books from what we can read here would have been much more powerful 3 i completely agree with sarah that shae is a bit underdeveloped so far when do tv producers understand that a women who looks a bit oriental and doesnt want to speak about her family falls a bit short of a really mysterious character but this girl from germany has a lot of potential and talent so we might see some improvement in the future 4 again the acting has been superb this week i just love maise williams and i cannot believe that she never did some acting before unbelievably talented 5 please guys do not start another discussion on accents in the uk and how they do and dont find the geography in westeros absolutely useless discussion 6 coming back to the spoilers issue i said it before and i can only repeat myself i think this forum can congratulate itself on the selfcontrol of its users sometimes i think that people should be more careful with statements like stannis baratheon wont show up before season 2 because it simply conveys that he wont have his part in the last episode but generally i can live with these spoilers given the interesting discussions we have and of course compared to what my excolleague did  a question on terminology i am no native speaker so i am always a bit cofused by your use of the word series i know for sure that a series in the us means the whole show an original series by hbo what you mean is season right "
"59" "Pillowhead" 2011-06-15 " re the dothraki ive personally always viewed them as mongol type race rather than native american the whole land across the narrow sea feels to me more like an asian style continent exotic and mysterious all silks and spices and strange religions kind of like the way it was viewed by people in the west a few hundred years agowesteros seems more of an allegory for europe to my mind at least full of warring clans with the snowy north europeans being like the celtsgoths and the more fancy mediterranean south europeans more of a grecoroman thing with kings landing standing as capital of power like ancient rome or constantinople "
"60" "candylilacs" 2011-06-15 " my so and i were talking about the point of the martins book and writing about this land where evil people seemingly triumph over the good i think the series and the books have talked a little about it before about how the old gods arent worshipped in the south anymore  there isnt a tie to the land as it was in the past that the dragons that once defined the lands royal house are gone completely  and they are exiled to foreign lands btw the whole idea of noble savages and that anything about the dothraki are in some way related to american indian plains tribes isnt accurate the north american tribes brutality if it can even be called that since it was mostly defense never equaled the atrocities by the us cavalry rape was also a rarity and although children and women were kidnapped they were invited to become part of the tribe and it was desired for adding new blood they also respected their elders which seems to be missing from the dothraki the savage dothraki seem to be based mostly on the huns or other marauding tribes during the roman era "

"65" "SummerBlade" 2011-06-15 " another way to look at what happened is that joffrey may be a spoilt little shit but hes only a kid and the big stark guy has accused him of being the product of an incestuous relationship of course he believes his mother to be innocent of such a monstrous crime why shouldnt he neds accusations if proven could cost his mothers head  and his own like his real father  jaime  he acts instinctually perceiving an apparent advantage without considering the wider ramifications of his actions but he acts truly in his own interests to secure his claim to the throne "
"66" "candylilacs" 2011-06-15 " wishface yes i also have been worried about how cgi could make everything ludicrous i hope they used their budget to make the last episode not painful to watch i think the book prepared readers more for the death of ned it became increasingly clear he was in a pit of vipers and that couldnt end well but onn television we tend to expect good to triumph over evil and main characters to live  but that doesnt always happen the death of ned who is about honor and what is right symbolizes the death of honor in the kingdom  so what now what do you think will happen to westeros "

"73" "badbadger31" 2011-06-15 " dang that was something it was interesting how cersei didnt see the full extent of joffreys malice coming from a mile off but than i suppose parents can have blind spots when it comes to their children a prime example being ned not seing that of all his children arya is the most like him what an absolutely cracking episode so gutted for ned he was to noble for the vipers nest of kings landing i really hope dany manages to pull summat out of her ass cos them dothraki boys dont fuck about i may have to read the rest of the books now cos i certainly cant wait a whole chuffing year for another series "

"75" "Shack" 2011-06-15 " walkerboyuk whats most frustrating is that hes taken the name of the true heir to the throne to his grave how now to move joffrey from power do you mean the truth about joffrey or the existence of a bastard he did send his trusted man with a note to be delivered in person to the kings brother on another note for those who havent read the books before this series like me i can highly recommend starting despite knowing what is happening i amk finding the first book a great read for additional backstory and characterisation currently i am not reading ahead of the episodes my only dilema is whether i stop when i get up to the point the first series ends and continue to enjoy watching the next series in the way i have so far or continue to read through "
"76" "Leemac" 2011-06-15 " like most people i really loved this episode and the season as a whole it certainly has made think about what is to come there doesnt seem like there is enough time for the dothraki to get their act together and sail across the sea so we might not see them in action this season as for the appearance of blood magic it is the first time we have seen anything not rooted in the real world i do have this nagging doubt about that fantasy writers do like their happy endings so i worry that stannis baratheon might swoop in and save the day routing the lannisters from the rear or they might fire in a few dragons from out of nowhere it has been a great season but an ending like that would be disappointing "
"77" "ManofConstantSorrow" 2011-06-15 " i have no idea how much cgi costs and know it has been used sparingly so far but i just thought that to see one shot of a vast plain of a dothraki caravanserai or whatever it is called would give some scale to what drogo commands a marginal point but george lucas tried that in the first of the new star wars movie and ended up with 15 minutes of what looked like a sequence from command and conquer or civilization it doesnt work and for that reason im happy enough they left out the battle scenes i have to say got has been a largely unexpected but very great pleasure although i have a soft spot for grrm fevre dream screams for big screen treatment for example i cant abide fantasy as 99 of it is sub tolkien rubbish i now cant decide whetehr to buy and read athe books before season 2 or to wait in the hope that something as boltoutofblue as neds death happens again kudos to all concerned but particularly sean bean peter dinklage easily my favourite character in the show i cant wait to see where tyrions story is goingand emilia clarke peter vaughn is easily bossing the random brit award category at the moment though thats hardly a suprise "

"79" "HummDrumm" 2011-06-15 " series one is a scene setter for the rest of the serieses i think you will find in technical american terms the whole run of shows is called a series which is broken up into seasons  hence game of thrones is the series and we are currently watching season 1 with season 2 commisioned and due to be shown next year i preferred it when you could just look forward the the new series of the sweeny and they didnt go in for all this season story arc palaver however for got as its based on dicrete books it can be forgiven as for loose end being tied up i dont beleive that has even happened in the books yet and there are still two more to write even after a dance with dragons comes out next month so hopfully all will become clear some time around 2032 "

"119" "Pillowhead" 2011-06-14 " manus260 the impression i got last night was that it was purely joffrey playing to the crowd littlefinger did look pretty smug but i thought that was more because he knew he was about to be ruined and sent into exile although to me it seems he lied about the knife to kick this all off i do think he would have stood by ned if he had bent the knee to joffrey as a means of exercising power once ned refused to he had no choice but to act as he did whether he sees all out war as beneficial is a matter for debate redwinter no we havent he fled for dragonstone after john arryns death he doesnt come into it until season 2 "

"128" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-14 " grayfox im a book reader  and would agree with you aswell however there are a lot of book readers here who have been careful not to drop any spoliers  so to tar us all is a bit ott speaking on behalf of the book readers  the reason we are drawn to threads like this is because we remember the shock we got from reading and we are keen to be part of a crowd who are experiencing this for the first time  it is regrettable that some spoilers have crept there way through  but i think on the whole this has been one of the better discussion groups on the show the book readers have been guilty of providing too much information in some cases not spoilers as such but possible over explanation of some of the details  and i think the main spoilers havent been deliberate but more a case of pointing to future books and accidently dropping a line in that confirms a character is still around  or isnt  or whatever that shouldnt happen short of having post approval  censorship there is no way to keep the whole topic free the worst thing was that a couple of fan forums in the state got spoiler bombed a few weeks ago with major spoilers "

"131" "lmsava" 2011-06-14 " vestrit7 id never thought about cerseis reaction before how she also couldnt believe what joffrey had just done she may be a calculating venal btch but she genuinely thought they had done a deal with ned and i suspect she immediately realised that this made allout war inevitable yeah i think we will see some of the fallout from joffreys decision next week the decision to send ned to the wall was apparently agreed by the council his beheading was a rash impulse from the kid and he doesnt really understand the ramifications of beheading the lord of a great house there was a scene earlier in the series between cersei and joffrey where she tried to make him understand the consequences of using violent oppression as a means to rule theres so much going on in every scene in this series every episode is worth a second watch so you can gauge the reactions of background players like in robbs council of war last week where the focus was robb and greatjon going back to check the reactions of everyone during the beheading scene is worthwhile "
"132" "DiamondDag" 2011-06-14 " pillowhead yeah i thought it was a bit of a shame they didnt highlight quite so well the significance of robbs tactical victory especially after the last episode when various characters insulted him for being green im totally fine with the way they did the whispering wood battle though saves them some cash its just a little disappointing we didnt get another chance to see just how brilliant jaime is with a sword i know theon mentions he cut down 10 men but well show dont tell the only thing that really didnt sit well with me was the little comedy scene of tyrion being knocked out for the duration of the battle thats quite a big thing for his character taking away the experience of being in the thick of a fight surviving that battle was a big up yours to his dad after tywin had essentially put him in the vanguard to die "

"134" "Pillowhead" 2011-06-14 " thinking more about the whispering wood battle scene i think they could have made more out of how much a bit of a tactical brilliance it was from robb they laid the foundation with tywin dismissing him out of hand but then didnt really follow through by making obvious to people who havent read the book how he had just completely outwitted them and won a vital battle to relieve the siege at riverrun i guess maybe in next weeks episode theyll be mulling it over a bit more also i understand the points about big cast confusing people and saving money by delaying minor season 1 characters to season 2 but surely there was room for the blackfish he was vital to the whole battle as robbs chief scout still cant complain too much i still think theyre doing a grat job just that was one of my favourite parts of the first book "

"147" "redwinter" 2011-06-14 " this is the only show that ive ever made a real effort to avoid spoilers  and wow am i glad it didnt surprise me that ned died but i didnt see it coming so soon  id expected that he would make his pact with the devil and then await robbs arrival before meeting some suitably heroic end this this was brilliant while robb comes into his own as a leader with the selfawareness to be a great man joffrey also comes into his own  as a boy king with enough vanity to bring down a kingdom i am so hoping there is a confrontation with tywin lannister in his near future as many of you have said grrm is brilliant at playing with heroic stereotypes and jaimes capture was one of my favourite scenes of the series to date jaime has nothing at stake  only his life which he seems only too willing to sacrifice in the name of honour and glory or maybe redemption his stakes are all personal and the contrast with robb was marked i agree completely about the genius of keeping him in the background in earlier episodes this isnt a stereotypical white hat character riding to the rescue and accepting jaimes challenge from where winning or losing becomes rather meaningless this is a man complicated mature a leader who knows a thing or two about cost and value his lack of vanity was compelling  and shows him to be a man who has learned from his fathers mistakes as well as from his strengths ashverjee  completely agree about the brilliant interweaving of quieter character scenes for the first few episodes these did feel awkward but both last week and this week they have really added to both the pacing and the development of each episode 5onthe5  you werent the only one confused by precisely how jaime came to be captured thanks to all for the clarification clariana no culture has a monopoly on savagery or civilization brilliant  and oh so true i found something refreshing and honest for want of a better word about the dothrakis aversion to any of the hereditary power of the other kingdoms they live by strength alone i have no idea whats going to happen to drogo daenerys or her baby but i was practically screaming at jorah not to go into the tent given neds death all bets are off as far as the khal are concerned can another major character bite the dust well thats the genius of doing it once as someone mentioned upthread  now everythings in play "

"151" "lmsava" 2011-06-14 " the appeal of a song of ice and fire is that it doesnt follow typical fantasy conventions there are very few straightforward heroes and it makes the point very well that even the very best of people can be swallowed up by corrupt schemers if you tuned in expecting a typical heroes journey like star wars or lord of the rings then the next few series are going to be pretty hard going killing ned was the biggest statement that could be made in that respect as pretty much the only decent person at the head of a house in all the kingdom but the pieces are in place now with robb growing in stature i think people may become equally attached to him in the next series i agree that they should have shown some of the battle that led to jaimes capture the whole plan was laid out last week when robb released the lannister spy with the instruction to tell tywin 20000 northerners were coming to rip him a new one still would it really have cost much to have some tightly focussed battlefield shots of a a few starks and a few lannisters squaring off with some nice medieval hacking and blood gurgling noises in the background before jaime is taken there was also something else going on with jaime challenging robb to single combat jaime is an interesting character because he sees himself as a great warrior but also wants to be seen as honourable hes still trying to escape the kingslayer title as seen when he could have finished off ned a few episodes ago but got angry because one of his soldiers denied him the chance to do it fairly its a similar thing with challenging robb it gives him the chance to fight honorably and enhance his reputation smart of robb to recognise his limits "

"170" "deiseach" 2011-06-14 " pillowhead just had a look at some us boards and plenty of hbo you sucki wont be watching anymore type comments firstly the stupidity of blaming hbo is quite hilarious and the secondly the fact as many more measured american posters seem to be pointing out is that without his death there would not be a story my friend who is watching but has not read the books today amongst a load of wildly inaccurate predictions stated neds obviously going to die otherwise wheres the story it is shocking but surely once it sinks in the logic must hit excellent point fans of a song of ice and fire make much of the lack of magic or evil overlords cough sauron cough and how this makes it so much realistic but while enjoying the acting characterisation and production values there has been a lack of narrative in short where has it all being going now i think we have a plot point on which the whole thing will pivot and while the death of ned was abrupt it wasnt that much of a surprise what with george rr martins commendable willingness to kill off major characters and the unlikelihood of sean bean committing to a potential six or seven season show his death seemed inevitable sooner rather than later and im normally a complete klutz at spotting plot twists what bruce williss character is dead "
"171" "sadstatue" 2011-06-14 " storywise ive no problem with ned being killed off however he was one of the only believable characters in the entire show fortunately the other winterfell characters especially his son seem like theyll fill the void and im still fascinated by what winter and the other side if the wall have in store for us so ill definitely watch the next series "
"172" "clivemartyn" 2011-06-13 " amazing episode absolutely loving this series as i havent read the books it was a total shock to see ned die i was willing ayra and needle through the crowd praying she would stab the inbred idiot joffery and somehow mastermind a rescue so much happened in an hour  should have been double length to do it all justice would have loved to have seen jamies capture for example or tyrionbronns battlescenes i have a feeling the conclusion is going to leave us all on a knife edge for a year how can they wrap up this season in an hour next week the answer is they cant we will be left with some major battlescene or some major cliffhanger for the next 12 months and sales of george martins books will go through the roof "

"177" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-13 " as a reader this was the episode that i was waiting to see for the reaction this episode would be the one that would test how successful the series has been would it be a whimper or an outcry  i would agree with all the praise of the actors but for me one scene stood out acting wise and sent shivers down my neck  peter vaughns scene as maester aemon and now we know targaeryen  when talking to jon the shift in his voice and expression and the pent up anger in his choice to stand by his duty has his family was slaughtered it struck me when watching  as it didnt when reading  that he is telling this story to jon snow the bastard born son of ned stark one of king roberts most loyal lords  he must see the starks as being at least partly responsible for his familys slaughter and yet still serves the duty of the black so will jon leave the wall to go and support his brother  particularly once he find out about his fathers fate  or will he honour his vows to the black  "
"178" "objectinspace" 2011-06-13 " evening all last things first  neds demise and the reaction of his daughters was the most heartbreaking moment so far ashverjee spot on re tyrions scene him plus bronn and their road movie perhaps through a dystopian 1950s midwest americana along with ayra plus syrio of course my favourite characters characterisation spot on as ever have to however agree with those above that this episode was a bit disappointing on the battle front even if theyd just had a few shots of robbs lads appearing from nowhere and rinsing jamies southern lot it would have been hugely enjoyable more seriously these battles are key formative experiences for the characters particularly robb obviously and only showing the aftermath has left me feeling that weve missed a little of the elder starks transition to manhood one last note our excellent blogauthor is right on the money on how strongly danis performances have come through "
"179" "redronin" 2011-06-13 " vk1980  cant see how anyone could reasonably walk away from the show at this point because ned aka sean bean the most recognizable actor in it is dead while the beanster did a decent job neds character is probably one of the least compelling in the story imohope you can convince your wife to stick with it anyway for her sake "
"180" "edge1710" 2011-06-13 " when i watched this episode i first thought how nice of the little back story of tyrion im catching up with reading the books which is told earlier in the books and missed it but the the ending of the episode this must have been watching psycho for the first time when it was first releasedexcellent "
"181" "redronin" 2011-06-13 " what a stunning hour of tv that was top marks to the acting as ever im particularly impressed with the efforts from emilia clarke and co across the sea considering they have to say most of their lines in a madeup language neds death scene couldnt have been handled any better brought a tear to my eye despite the fact i knew what was coming also loved the scene between jon and aemon agree with sarah that its one of the key exchanges in the book and the writers managed to give it the gravitas it deserved anyone know when the dvd of series is coming out hope its not too far away as ill be going through withdrawal after final episode next week "
"182" "vk1980" 2011-06-13 " consequences i think that is the overall theme of the books  series every act committed by a character owes at least some part to what happened before people feel compelled to act lest they look impotent and sht hits the fan accordingly meanwhile we as readers  viewers know that there is real danger north of the wall it is spelled out and shown brilliantly i thought in the opening of the story and yet the players continue their game of thrones oblivious  ignorant civil war looks unavoidable further reducing the likelihood of recognition of this threat as for this episode i thought it was really good and the final minutes handled welli have read the book and so this lacked some of the i imagine raw impact for me but i thought the way they showed the suffering on aryas face was nice for readers over the 2 mediums tv definitely has the edge on such moments i just cant picture the look of despair on someone like that or indeed the resignation on neds face interested to see what reaction this has going forward certainly my non reader wife cant be alone in commenting well he was the only one ive really wanted to find out what happens to i guess this is the jumping off point for some people you are either in for the duration of the story now or you entirely reasonably walk away "

"186" "Pillowhead" 2011-06-13 " werthead really thats a shame i was hoping theyd put in that conversation with catelyn where robb decides to send him instead of greatjon because he scares him they got the whole her not wanting to undermine him when she turns up and hes talking tactics with the lads scene down perfectly though they both got the old we just want a cuddle but cant rountine spot on if they get the budget right for season 2 it will possibly be one of the best things ever "

"188" "CloudDog23" 2011-06-13 " i jested on friday with some friends that jon snow is the only safe character in the whole series for without him wed have no reason to be at the wall even ned wasnt safe turns out i was right "

"197" "Clariana" 2011-06-13 " yes jorah mormont is the son of the nightwatchs current commander he was exiled and disinherited by ned no less for selling two poachers to slavers a big nono in the civilized seven kingdoms "
"198" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-13 " clariana  excellent point one of the things ive found interesting is that contrast between the songs and the chivalry and brutal reality  thats what fascinated me most about the brief jaime scene the realisation that he is more than half in love with the steel dance to the point that nothing else has real purpose or value "
"199" "ArticulateGhost" 2011-06-13 " that was a good episode really enjoyed itneds death was shocking kept expecting someone to call out and shout theyve got jaime or something joffrey is a right little prick lol shits gonna go down now though and i expect the northerners are a lot more deadly when theyre angry p can someone help me out though im not the most attentive of watchers especially when it comes to something like this but have we found out at some point that the guy with the dolthraki jorah is the son of the leader of the nights watch i dont know how i could have missed it but no one has mentioned it or anything im gonna be so bored when a exams are finished b doctor who has finished already happened and c game of thrones has finished put that on top of the end of the football season and say hello to one shit summer p ps sorry about spelling i aint on chrome and cant be arsed to proof read "
"200" "Clariana" 2011-06-13 " i liked some of the parallelisms jorah advising dany to flee because once drogo dies shell be fair game concluding his admonishment with this isnt the seven kingdoms cut to the seven kingdoms and maester aemon recalls how his brother was slaughtered and all his young children and then the final scene ned confesses and joffrey still has him executed in public no culture has a monopoly on savagery or civilization "

"202" "Werthead" 2011-06-13 " the military situation in the books is a bit different robb comes south with about 20000 men tywins army is actually camped at the crossroads inn ironically where tyrion was taken prisoner kicking the whole war off in the first place cat negotiates with walder frey expanding the army by about 4000 and robb splits his army of 24000 in two he sends 12000 men under the command of the wary cautious lord roose bolton to fight tywins army and sends the rest to relieve the siege of riverrun boltons forces fight tywin and keep him busy before beating an organised retreat so by that the time the battle is done tywin has managed to kill a few thousand troops and capture a few highborn prisoners but that part of the stark army is still intact and when he learns about the deception robb is about 300 miles away attacking jaime and tywin can do nothing at all about it in the tv series the two lannister armies are much closer together hence the decision to sacrifice 2000 men so the rest can sneak past in the night and capture jaime before tywin can react "

"206" "Werthead" 2011-06-13 " a good fortyfive or so years ago gene roddenberry later of star trek fame proposed a new tv cop series to a studio he suggested that start the series with a really big name as the main star but in reality would only pay him for half the first season hed then be killed off and replaced by another star whod stick around for the duration the audience would be more on the edge of the seat as they wouldnt know if theyd just decide to kill off the newcomer for the sake of it it didnt happen and im not sure its happened before on american television up until now sure actors have actually left or quit shows unexpectedly and had to be offed at a moments notice but in this case the leading actor was put up on all the posters and merchandising by hbo in the full knowledge he was being killed off nine weeks into the series even where a series has been based on books before that killed off a main character theyre often tweaked to allow them to survive lafayette in true blood for example was offed in book 1 of the novels but is still a major player in season 4 of the tv show matthew fox was originally going to be killed in the first episode of lost as well but the execs changed their minds and made him the star instead british tv is a little braver they offed jamie bamber after one episdoe of outcasts though he wasnt exactly a huge name anyway lisa faulkner was killed off in two episodes of spooks but again wasnt a huge star on the level that sean bean is so kudos to hbo for agreeing to do this and not try to exert pressure on the producers to keep him around for the duration some have pointed out that bean wouldnt have been able to stick around due to his movie career but then his next job is on regular american network tv anyway so in fact he could have decided to hang around quite easily given the shock its generated in the american press its certainly had the desired impact "
