"1" "lemonlace" 2014-05-12 " littlefinger was brought up by hoster tully alongside catelyn starktully lysa arryntully and edmure tully they were raised a little like siblings i think hence why robin sees petyr as an uncle its a bit frustrating that lysa is so often written off as mad shes damaged and had an awful childhood theyve mentioned it only briefly in the show but she was in love with petyr and of course petyr was in love with cat at some point a presumably teenage petyr got drunk and then slept with lysa mistaking her for her sister lysa fell pregnant and her father forced her to have an abortion against her will i think shes forced to drink a potion and so loses a child with the man she loves although who doesnt love her back lysa was never the same after that and its a pretty horrific story she was then forced by hoster to marry a very old man who required a child but not a wife jon arryn i just feel very sorry for lysa shes been in love with petyr all this time and seems to really trust him it also might explain robins strange behaviour too "

"3" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-12 " mmm actually not sure it does look like the union flag and if it was meant as that does that make the lannisters the republicans the boltons mrs ts tories and ser dontal geo wubblyu scary "
"4" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-05-12 " i think hes probably dead though i was also hoping that he had somehow escaped but it is worthing considering that just because arya believes him to be dead doesnt necessarily mean that hes actually dead heck a whole lot of people are convinced that shes dead "
"5" "doncobaino" 2014-05-12 " i always hoped the syrio forel the water dancer had somehow escaped "
"6" "Simon Thomson" 2014-05-12 " odd or just effective that the moment we find out baelish has coordinated everything from the getgo is the same moment as he starts to lose control he needed to snog the face off maddaunt mcgregor and he had to marry her too nice plotting i think to stop any character from ever seeming totally in control of the game as becomes dull with dany occasionally "
"7" "Simon Thomson" 2014-05-12 " it feels more like the 1000s or earlier than the 1400s to me i know theres a lot of war of the roses malarkey spoken about it but the religious pluralism uncertainty about how powerful women are allowed to be and complexlyconflictedallied nations are much more like the anglosaxon  scandinavian  ottonian world than the high medieval period which would fit with the weapons as you argue "
"8" "Simon Thomson" 2014-05-12 " everywhere in the world they hurt little girls cersei gets all the best most painful lines at the moment shes becoming a character too complex and damaged for her actor and writers "
"9" "Simon Thomson" 2014-05-12 " sos shakespeare and chaucer and im a lecturer in english lit content is irrelevant its style and form that creates value "
"10" "Simon Thomson" 2014-05-12 " cut from dany to baelish talking about how impregnable the eyrie issurely thats the show doing its own spoilers i havent read the books but there must be some form of climax where petyr thinks hes won and sits laughing on a pile of bones only to be incinerated by an angry dragon "
"11" "rickyredmanc" 2014-05-12 " lord walder of house frey and brienne of tarth would be interesting "
"12" "YoothaJoyce" 2014-05-11 " hangs head in shamei wish the blackfish was really a pirate though "
"13" "pookiesu" 2014-05-11 " lysa had said in an earlier season that jon arryn wanted to send their milksop son away as a ward of insert character name here i cant remember to toughen him up certainly gave her the motive  now we hear that littlefinger provided the means "
"14" "pookiesu" 2014-05-11 " the melting down of ice has bugged me all along pretty sure enough characters have banged on about valyrian steel being readily identifiable by its repeated foldinghammering leaving a telltale watermark ripple on the surface therefore melting it down  casting it in a mould would totally lose the original look of the thing wouldnt it so how does everyone still recognise it for valyrian steel other than that it seems to be exceptionally shiny "
"15" "NZerDan" 2014-05-11 " i dont know why folks keep knocking affc and adwd they both stand up well in the overall story and grrm lets us into a lot of character motives having a reread of adwd now and it is full of tension the series has not quite managed to reach imo "
"16" "aduguid1" 2014-05-11 " that was terrible thanks mildred "
"17" "Clariana" 2014-05-10 " i really think they are equal opportunity jokers tis all "
"18" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-10 " you may well be right and i seem to remember they got caught out with the george wubbleu head on a pike thing claiming it was a budget constraint that meant they had to recycle old heads no sniggering at the back so i think it was georges head model of obvs  not just a resemblance  they even issued an apology  denial that they were antibushist indeed twice no  neither did i clock ser dontal floss as captain america tbh what are they trying to say there if so nor the flayed union jack so make that thrice a shameful 210 for observation and must try look harder here then "
"19" "YoothaJoyce" 2014-05-10 " it seems the blackfish has taken to the high seas and pocketed the advertising mans shillingi miss him too links a go go here httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvohpf09ho6qs "

"21" "StephenRedmayne" 2014-05-10 " im becoming obsessed by the iron bank of braavosi am too  i was left wondering what means to they have of enforcing repayment of their debts if tywin lannister thinks them something to fear i truly look forward to finding out why "
"22" "YoothaJoyce" 2014-05-10 " you just know hes going to be fabulous in this i cant waiti suspect he may veer more towards a slightly mycroft playing of the role but s one commenter has already mentioned im so sorry i cant remember exactly who to attribute this to it would be heaven if he somehow decided to play the role as glen bulb from nighty nightshall i try one of my usual epic fail links oh go on then  httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvmrpkrkyvvta "
"23" "aduguid1" 2014-05-10 " blackfish where are you "
"24" "Dryhtscipe" 2014-05-10 " yeah havent they heard of trains "
"25" "Dryhtscipe" 2014-05-09 " a bet in which tyrion supposedly bet against jaime sounds legit "
"26" "Clariana" 2014-05-09 " i think its the series producers having their little jokes did you notice the resemblance between the banners of house bolton with the flayed man and the union jack that when drunk ser dontos first made his ignominious appearance there were stars and stripes on his armour and his shield resembled that of captain america in the second or third series there were shots taken of one of the heads on a pike because it resembled george bus "
"27" "harangutan2006" 2014-05-09 " yeah i guess still though it seemed like a highrisk strategy on the lessthancertain hope that bran would know where rickon was to be found "
"28" "Clariana" 2014-05-09 " yes there is that possibility good catch "
"29" "Clariana" 2014-05-09 " i recently read and enjoyed the iron king which i would not have done but for grr martin and btw grr is the type of writer who actively encourages everyone to read and lauds reading and knowledge at every turn "
"30" "Clariana" 2014-05-09 " good for you personally when its on its the highlight of my week and then i get the boxset it repays reviewing "

"34" "chriskilby" 2014-05-09 " feefyfoefuck "
"35" "Clariana" 2014-05-09 " its not called being raped but whoring interesting that later on lysa was talking about the disgusting things the women in petyrs brothels do with their bodies overlooking the fact that her beloved petyr had just done the exact same thing to obtain power over the vale "
"36" "Steve Cook" 2014-05-09 " well if somebody stuck their thumb up maybe that would explain the howling or at least some of it "
"37" "Jez Holland" 2014-05-09 " apologies i would post them but that may constitute a spoiler but they can be found if you do a search for game of thrones on imdb or on the forum at westerosorg "
"38" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-09 " cant even spell it and get horribly confused between it and irony that aside i have not seen the ep titles for s4 sorry what  where are they "
"39" "Jez Holland" 2014-05-09 " aha you know sarcasm well done a look at the episode titles gives it away but dont be cross that you hadnt figured that out "
"40" "Sunburst" 2014-05-09 " yes but thats not elvis costello in the picture its me impersonating elvis costello "
"41" "Dukered" 2014-05-09 " i agree with sarah on this character development is fine but it does seem as though there are too many filler scenes in the first 40 mins just to kill time before the climax i dont think this was the case in previous seasons "
"42" "Dukered" 2014-05-09 " but martin does not need to write two books by 2017 there are already two huge books written and released that season 4 will not touch so that is seasons 5 and 6 taken care of already with two more huge books still yet to be released which will form seasons 7 and 8 i dont see a problem as long as martin releases the next book within the next 12 years which i think is likely to happen "
"43" "Dukered" 2014-05-09 " id love to see a romance blossom between lysa and ramsey snow can you imagine the pair of them together would be madder than a box of frogs on a campfire "
"44" "Dukered" 2014-05-09 " barristans advice to dany about answering in justice with mercy was extremely good advice and dany would have done well to listen to him "
"45" "Dukered" 2014-05-09 " i think the first episode was the best of this season certainly the classiest imho from the melting of the stark sword ice to the black comedy of arya and the hound it had everything that episode "
"46" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-09 " you know the script running order wow spill "
"47" "Dukered" 2014-05-09 " i thought the podbrienne scenes were pointless to be honest i love the fact they are together and i enjoyed those chapters in the books but what actually happened in those scenes we established that pod cant ride a horse or skin a rabbitso what we didnt need two whole scenes just for that plenty of great material gets cut out of the books as it is so there is no excuse for wasting scenes with unnecessary flab we had already established the week before that brienne did not want a squire and that pod was not a competent squire although we know he is loyal so we didnt need these points reiterated at all we have had three scenes with these two characters now and nothing at all has happened to them yet i cant help feeling that the screenwriters are dragging out the briennepod andaryahound scenes for no real reasonas much as i enjoy these characters i would like there to be a bit more of a purpose to their scenes "
"48" "Dukered" 2014-05-09 " i wasnt quite sure why he didnt just kill bran and make his escape trying to smuggle him out past the assorted nights watch and mutineers seemed like an unnecessarily risky strategy his orders were to find both bran and rickon if he had killed bran then he would have had no means of finding rickon "
"49" "Dukered" 2014-05-09 " guysi know you are trying to avoid spoilers but even as a book reader i think you are pushing it with these comments "
"50" "Dukered" 2014-05-09 " almost a bit too sympathetic for me thats why i quite liked the fact that cersei ordered the wedding leftovers to be taken to the kennels  it reminded us that she is still a total bitch she is the most interesting character out of all the villains in the show though "
"51" "Jez Holland" 2014-05-09 " it may pique someones interest i think that those who know what is happening in episode 8 may be interested emphasis on the may "
"52" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-09 " youre saying not enough eps per season i take it "
"53" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-09 " given that the blog police will be round at 500 am if you divulge a spoilerthat was so cryptic it almost wasnt worth postingwas it "
"54" "ROUcynic" 2014-05-09 " its a good point but its more about bran crossing a rubicon than the effect on hodor "
"55" "ROUcynic" 2014-05-09 " indeed  echos of brons schooling of jaime "
"56" "ROUcynic" 2014-05-09 " i believe that our very own mycroft is turning up as a wandering iron bank rep "
"57" "ROUcynic" 2014-05-09 " make them fly "
"58" "ROUcynic" 2014-05-09 " un tru dat "

"62" "ROUcynic" 2014-05-09 " a very interesting question  how were dragons controlled before or were they "
"63" "Moreisless" 2014-05-09 " i have some how got it into my head that it must be something to do with the difference between a series and a miniseriesi know 10 is a nice round figure but i always get he feeling that 10 episodes per series done not do the source material any favours "
"64" "miapatrick" 2014-05-09 " elvis costellos birth name is declan macmanus look at the songwriting credits on blood and chocolate many of them are credited to macmanus all written by the same artist "
"65" "Jez Holland" 2014-05-09 " i am not going into too many details here but it was subtle as i only just picked up on it today but there was a nice piece of foreshadowing in this episode to a later event in this season probably around episode 8 i guess "
"66" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-09 " a nice round figure so the hbo bean counters can more readily work out the cost per episode "
"67" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-09 " youd really hope so jonny a geopolitical doff of the cap if anything or else that way very deep waters lie should it be intended as any significant political statement surely and at that as cited by tywin it is not always the accepted translation anyway as i understand it but seen as fitting in with the outsiders the british view of the party  so maybe sarahs irishtuned radar was a little too sensitive after all and blipped on something that just wasnt there but that said given bws joint backstory in the south i still think it would be a hell of a coincidence love to know where they were coming from though "
"68" "Moreisless" 2014-05-09 " does anyone know why hbo and the producers choose to make 10 episodes per series is is a commercial or creative choice  "
"69" "rickyredmanc" 2014-05-09 " true "
"70" "trizzer" 2014-05-09 " as i said last week me and my mate are waiting for brodor to rape meera with grrm its very very possible "
"71" "CaptainCanada" 2014-05-08 " acting lord of the vale robin is lord of the vale hes just a minor "
"72" "Sunburst" 2014-05-08 " dont get snippy because you based your little hissy fit on absences that didnt exist the whole point of varys is all the lovely things he says he didnt say a word my god its like im talking to a 2yearold every time you come on here you say the same thing this show is going down the tubes its not what it once was im going to quitstabs out cigaretteive tried to quit i will quit but i never say that i never said its not what it once was it was always a trashy vulgar soap opera i also never said that ill quit it ill keep on watching it i enjoy a little bit of trashy vulgar soap opera here and there and put up a new picture dammit your posts are a disgrace to the fine literary traditions of declan patrick macmanus thats not declan patrick macmanus my god your post consisted of three points and all three were utterly wrong who in the ice and fire world could i compare you to lollys "
"73" "jimmy_mac" 2014-05-08 " thanks for clarifying much appreciated "
"74" "unpleasantmilk" 2014-05-08 " hound is my new fave character that is all "
"75" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-05-08 " as a resident of belfast right beside the great hall of kings landing well when the iron throne is there aka the paint house where many movies have been made id hope its a passing thing they have simply nodded to and nothing more well because of local politics which they have been involved in maybe even a nod to politicians involved in securing the grants they receive from the local economy sinn féin took the original phrase for their slogan it referred historically to the irish language not politics "
"76" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-05-08 " excellently done indeed loco lysa is almost worse than joffrey "
"77" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-08 " mmm a minor villain in the grand scheme yes  but a major badass also which made him a very real threat to the main stark men at crasters and had his brief been slightly wider from bolton snr or had he expanded his own hit list he could have done a lot more damage but yes they cant all get a showpiece dispatch "
"78" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-05-08 " i agree except for the caitlyn part you have a nice name "
"79" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-05-08 " i am really excited for sansas storyline i am a sansa fan "
"80" "CavalierDisregard" 2014-05-08 " m pretty sure lysa said something in this episode about how littlefinger and blackfish her uncle had fought each other or dueled each other at some point in the past i think she even said bryndan almost killed littlefinger she said it about brandon stark neds brother killed by the mad king who was betrothed to cat before ned was not her uncle bryndon i can understand how this was unclear to nonbook readers though "
"81" "longtimelurker93" 2014-05-08 " i think lockes death was supposed to be underwhelming to show that hes a minor villain when you look at the bigger picture "
"82" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-08 " many disparaging views because this isnt in the book dont think  not got that far but if you park that for a second i think the premise and narrative of the what happened is absolutely fine that said with this included i felt a little underwhelmed at the how it was done really  most notably locke who seemed to fizzle out which seemed odd for a character with such a badass cv and genuine threat he just didnt do the damage he could have potentially done no bad thing for js of course on the upside i thought tanners knife twirlywhirly stuff was very impressive and fitting that it took jss broadsword to cleanse his potty mouth "
"83" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-08 " i meant the book "
"84" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-08 " sarah  or anyone else for that matter  any more views in the sinn féin angle as touched on below "
"85" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-08 " abhorrent little twerp covers it him far better "
"86" "longtimelurker93" 2014-05-08 " everyone questioning the crasters keep scenes  im sure itll become appropriate when jon returns to castle black and thorne realises his popularity will increase tenfold because of the victory the whole reason thorne allowed him to go in the first place was because he thought jon would die there "
"87" "longtimelurker93" 2014-05-08 " stick with it i watched the first eight episodes of season one then stopped once i gave it another go i was hooked "
"88" "fenixx" 2014-05-08 " looked ok on my tv pompeii in 3d at the cinema was definitely too dark though poor jon snoooow  always in the dark "
"89" "fenixx" 2014-05-08 " and tolkein too  "
"90" "ocelot75" 2014-05-08 " hmmm i wonder if he does have his eye on it then again he knows what the iron throne brings with it he is undoubtably the master puppeteer "
"91" "sunnyone" 2014-05-08 " his given name is robert or so i believe as jon arryn was king roberts hand this from memory so correct me if im wrong but his pet name is sweet robinso both are correct "
"92" "tomaszzaraza" 2014-05-08 " and it seems like greyjoys sister set sail to rescue him what feels like 200 episodes ago "

"95" "MJ1972" 2014-05-08 " theres also a rather explicit scene in which cersei makes love to her lady love sliding her fingers into that myrish swamp the description leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination i like the books but martin should steer clear of erotica the way he describes sexuality is rather nauseating in my opinion  and im not the slightest bit prudish "
"96" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-05-08 " she is certainly going down a very dark character arc i think most people are still on her side simply because of who she is and what she has been through but i think we may be setting up a classic victim becomes the abuser storyline with arya her fixation with killing people who have wronged her is pathalogical i think yorens story about fixating on vegence agaisnt the man who killed his brother was a foreshadowing of aryas fate by then end he could no longer even remember what his brother looked like he was so consumed by hatred "
"97" "rickyredmanc" 2014-05-08 " best scene this week was that scene where lysa was sat down with sansa eating lemon cakes and lysa grasps sansas hands and goes on an absolute pearler of a wobbler with sansa getting increasingly freaked out by her head the ball aunt i was laughing my head off d<U+FEFF> "
"98" "MikkiDisco" 2014-05-07 " waitnbsp did you just out bugs bunny "
"99" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-05-07 " i think ser barristans talk of mercy does indeed show that our queen has been a little bit petulant and hell bent on some kind of revenge liberation crusade believing in having the moral high ground things are now starting to come back and bite her this slave freeing business has been a bit black and white so far as tywin said of robert ruling is different than conquering "

"108" "Barninho" 2014-05-07 " not having read the books i apologize if ive inadvertently spoiled something my psychic powers must be particularly wellattuned today my hunch comes from the fact that they had a big scene to show how much she trusts him ergo everything there must be about to go to shit the only spoiler i can see is someone saying the way dany found out in the books isnt viable in the tv show so the book readers dont seem to have the advantage here for once they seem in the dark too i guess the fact that dany found out in the books is a spoiler of sorts but i dont think it means anything my book reader friends tell me theres more and more changes especially recently and even with things like the plot i obviously tell them to shut up "
"109" "YoothaJoyce" 2014-05-07 " oh how i love that particular blog its absolutely stunning both in the way the very talented blogger links the historical inspirations of grr and the sheer breadth of them "
"110" "YoothaJoyce" 2014-05-07 " absolutely i remember that hint very well as it immediately made me speculate on just how much varys is holding back and to wonder exactly whose side he is on i dont know if grr martin wants us to find varys particularly likeable  but i really really like him i always find myself rooting for him somehow as i suspect he does have the the good of the kingdom in his heart whatever form that good takes i have no idea as yet and thats why he so intrigues me unlike baelish who repulses mehuge kudos to conleth hill and aidan gillan "
"111" "QuestionMark83" 2014-05-07 " in fact it appears it was deliberately changed for the tv series so as not to cause confusion with king robert for whom he was actually named "
"112" "jimmy_mac" 2014-05-07 " interesting thought "
"113" "jimmy_mac" 2014-05-07 " im pretty sure lysa said something in this episode about how littlefinger and blackfish her uncle had fought each other or dueled each other at some point in the past i think she even said bryndan almost killed littlefinger i could be very mistaken about that the line seemed to be said in passing to sansa in the discussion about whats he done to your pretty young body at any rate it might mean that theres already animosity between the uncle and his weasel of a nephew "
"114" "QuestionMark83" 2014-05-07 " whoops yes you are right blame writing at very early hour which led to bookshow confusion you are right sarah to refer to him as robin as he was called in this episode hes credited as robin on imdb "
"115" "keef1980" 2014-05-07 " i started the first series three weeks ago and have binge watched the entire thing until im now up to date and able to participate in threads thanks sarah in the first few episodes as i was floundering to keep up with the introductions of characters and work out their motivations while remembering who they are the recaps have been a big help a thought ive not seen addressed so far  does anyone else think dany might actually have potential to become a major antagonist everything ive read seems to work on the basis that shes unquestionably one of the most morally pure characters but ive noticed some assumptions sheher group have made that could change that  the biggest of which is the idea that as long as they are prepared and able to do stuff properly she will be welcomed  what if shes not has she really been in a position thus far where shes had to make a real moral choice id argue that the only time she has shes been utterly without mercy  every good deed she has done has been to the benefit of her cause not to its detriment ive not read the books so please no book spoilers but does anyone think theres anything in this "
"116" "Dukered" 2014-05-07 " there are at least another two seasons worth of books left after this season i reckon and that doesnt include the books that havent been writtenreleased yet i cant remember much else left to happen in a storm of swords besides the tyrion arc and the end chapter for each character are you kidding me there is so much left to happen from asos that im not sure how they will fit it all in to just 5 episodesthat was by far the most eventful of all the books yet most of the events in question are still to take place on tv only one major event has occurred from that book and that was the purple wedding the rest is still to come yay "

"323" "Lingli" 2014-05-06 " i think she does spend time with them but if i recall the bigger they get the fiercer and more independent they get some targaeryans could ride dragons didnt shireen tell davos a story about two targaeryan sisters and a brother and how they flew on dragons but i think the person has to have a special bond with that particular dragon  you cant just hop off one and onto another and how can you be sure that the dragons know who the enemy is and whos on their side thinking about it theyd probably be more effective as a kind of nuclear deterrentpr tool especially because no ones seen one for hundreds of years so whos going to remember the particulars of using one for warfare  "

"328" "sunnyone" 2014-05-06 " did someone say theyd seen gendry in meereen in one of the previous blogs i asked for clarification of this from the op but answer came there none or should i say that i couldnt find the post again personally i dont think it was gendry though i suppose he would have had time to get there in that little boat that davos put him in i had forgotten that beric and thoros had sold gendry to melisandre so i suppose in aryas eyes they had to go on the kill list gosh theres been a lot of water under the bridge hasnt there "
"329" "Sinequanone" 2014-05-06 " they do walk pretty slowly slower than the wilding army i guess the wildings are making sure they just stay ahead of them "

"338" "backfromtokyo" 2014-05-06 " yeah in the show theyve used it when theyve been in trouble to quieten hodor or to use his strength as a device to get them out of trouble its more troubling in the books i think they will explore what bran does as his story progresses hope so anyway the morality of warging into a human and the dangers of it in general are quite interesting "
"339" "malevoisine" 2014-05-06 " what about the brotherhood without banners anyone even remember them i was wondering about that too they still have a role to play in the books im thinking we might see them again in episode 9 or 10 "
"340" "EscapeeThree" 2014-05-06 " they did sell gendry to melisandre although theyre probably not quite as deserving as some of the others on the list or those that have already met their demise it does interest me to see how blackandwhite her list is though  beric dondarrionthoros and cerseithe mountain have nothing separating them in her eyes despite the huge differences in their crimes the other question is whether or not theres a way off that list for the hound or anyone unless they die did someone say theyd seen gendry in meereen in one of the previous blogs ive not had a chance to look back for myself and check but that could be something to watch out for "

"350" "realstokebloke" 2014-05-06 " im with you on the not boring side of the fence have some reservations with the crasters keep section mainly with an underplayed locke fizzling out without a bang but that aside largely agree with your bon mots in the episodes defence "
"351" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-06 " i was thinking  they might have to do it in a year depending on how plot heavy the end of the story will be i can see how they could make many parts much shorter for tv and consolidate some characters ot leave others out but it would be a very plot and character heavy season which makes me think they will really want to be ready to go next season right off the bat and maybe wrap up some of the storylines going on now more completely than they were at the end of book 3 "
"352" "dsk84" 2014-05-06 " you may laugh but i remember i when i was a child i knew a family where the mother had divorced and married again it was to someone she and her sons had known for a while but even after marriage her sons continued to call her new husband uncle "

"354" "Archer93" 2014-05-06 " ooh i like the syrio is jaqen idea and it could be made to worktrant disarmes and disables syrio but doesnt kill him because he thinks syrio can be forced to tell him where arya went instead he has him thrown into the black cells where syrio becomes jaqen this next bit will rely a bit on the management of the black cells being rather poor but i dont think thats a real problem trant goes to interrogate syrio but is lead to what seems to be the wrong cell with an unexpected prisoner who gives his name as jaqen hghar the braavosi equivalent of puddin tame maybe p furious trant never officially reports the capture of syrio and packs the mystery prisoner off to the wall cue jaqen and aryas meeting a bit coincidental sure unless syriojaqen is playing a very long gameany thoughtsproblems "

"377" "steve3742" 2014-05-06 " my favorite tv series is the reimaged battlestar gallactica killer robots with space jesus as a platform for depicting the human struggle is where it’s at i always thought it failed dismally to deal with the reality of its opening episodes at a conservative guess 50 billion people are killed in the opening episodes leaving the entire human race reduced to 50000 refugees fleeing an enemy bent on their annihilation the scale of this is beyond imagination the holocaust was mild by comparisom imagine if the nazis had killed every jew in the world barring a few dozen and had dispatched hunterkiller agents to kill the rest but the analogy breaks down pretty quickly galactica never adresses this effectively when it does its to make facile analogies with the warren terra incredibly disappointing and what exactly was the plan anyway "
"378" "Lingli" 2014-05-06 " yes i see that  i think it was the actual wording of it that i didnt like but its a small nitpick  youre absolutely right about lysa being the ultimate loose cannon  just as well shes squirreled away in the eyrie "
"379" "Jez Holland" 2014-05-06 " im six books in really "
"380" "Lingli" 2014-05-06 " oh yes i think the purpose of the crasters subplot is quite clear and i think it or something similar probably had to be done because its hard to show someone developing as a character without them actually doing something i guess i just wasnt that convinced by it bluegoat i dont know if i ever thought of him as an airhead but i think jon  like everyone else  does change and mature and he obviously has to make some very hard decisions in a way i think id have preferred him to see bran and for them both to have to accept that brans path was a different one given that jon was always aware that he wasnt a real stark it could have underlined the genuine affection and desire for family that the brothers shared versus their understanding of duty and honour something of a theme this episode ah well "
"381" "AkaSomethingElse" 2014-05-06 " how is it that the hound has been trekking for weeks or months with arya and yet has neither heard her recite her hitlist before or seen her practice her waterdancing "

"383" "rooksx" 2014-05-06 " i had no problems with the pacing of this episode mainly because the characters are so strong i could cheerfully watch a spinoff show where arya and the hound traipse around the countryside argue a lot start fights in pubs threaten to kill each other etc episode 3 was the low point in terms of pacing very little of interest happened "
"384" "Bluedylan" 2014-05-06 " obviously each to hisher own but i find some of the complaints about pacing meandering storylines no character development etc etc to be bizarre i found this episode to be absolutely riveting brianne and pod aside and i think this has been the best season so far events at the eyrie are fascinating the littlefingerlysa reveal was huge what does littlefinger want with sansa is it just the proxy obsession with cat who is going to disappear through the moon door this season surely someone will obviously littlefinger is to blame for the jon arryn plot but once again some of the blame can be laid at cats door for a saving littlefingers life when they were younger and b going on her crazy sisters word about jon arryns murder and starting the war in the first place cersei is trying to prejudice the trial and i dont think for a moment tywin or prince oberyn are fooled by it personally cant wait for the trial and how that plays out for me these were the best dany scenes for quite some time because she had to actually engage with real issues of how to rule and how to achieve power rather than simply strolling into town and shouting dracaris a few times it was nice to also see that she actually listened to sir jorah of house friendzone finally the scenes at crastors were also exciting interesting to see bran using hodors strength to escape and to wonder whether he will do that more often i personally think they couldve reunited bran and jon snow for a couple of scenes just to throw the viewers a bone some brief happiness and human warmth sometimes goes a long way bran couldve convinced jon that he had to go north for me so that was a little disappointing "

"392" "rooksx" 2014-05-06 " this theory that sansa might seemingly out of nowhere become a powerful figure is gaining more traction as the most manipulated person in westeros it would be a great twist if she used her wretched experience to turn the tables on everyone there were hints in this episode and the previous one that shes become more perceptive and less naive "

"404" "Jez Holland" 2014-05-06 " this episode saw a very different cersei to the one we are used too leaving people to ask what her game is the game is obvious when you consider the people she was talking too margeary tyrell tywin lannister and oberyn martell when we consider that since the departure of olenna tyrell margaery is now the dominant member of house tyrell what with mace already painted as a buffoon and a puppet then we have someone trying to manipulate the three judges of tyrions trial these scenes played out well and the manipulation was very subtle we also saw the reveal of jon arryns killer with this knowledge you then need to go back and question the events of the previous 3 seasons you will then see that baelish is playing a long game and has a hand in manipulating events beyond what we may already know if only he hadnt kissed lysa before the end of all her exposition talking of lysa we have a character here who will give selyse baratheon a run for her money in the nutjob stakes and she is screamer at that poor sansa seems to have fallen out of the frying pan and into the fire aryas lessons in how to be a badass continued and we saw her waterdancing skills have improved a great deal but she also learnt that it is going to take more than sword skills to kill someone like the hound we learnt that brienne and pod are heading to the wall which sounds a little daft considering there is a relative or aryas and sansas in the vale although it was a funny scene between the 2 of them dany also learnt that being a ruler is more than frying people with dragonfire and freeing the slaves so with mereen she has decided to stay and rule although we have seen that she has poor control over one section of her small council this could cause her some issues in the future north of the wall we saw a small skirmish at crasters and some excellent scenes with bran warging into hodor and jons one on one with karl tanner i also enjoyed him being reunited with ghost next weeks episode promises some more stannis action some greyjoy action and the start of the trial i think it could be the episode of the season so far "

"408" "DanteDanger" 2014-05-06 " i actually really enjoyed the episode though there were one or two ridiculous moments ve arya and the hound are great fun to watch maise williams is a talented young actress and their dialogue is always amusing this episode was all about scene setting for the rest of the season weve got the cersi pulling the strings ahead of the trial and danis arc defined for the rest of the season ie consolidate what you have and learn to rule littlefinger and lysa had a great creep out  its revealed the answer to 2 of the longest standing qs and put sansa into relative safety  captivity it was good to get some degree of closure on her story for now to allow the series to focus on the more exicting aspects of the series ve i dont know what john snows plan was  sneak up to crasters keep then run apparently slowly towards the keep screaming at full volume to let the muderers know youre arriving other than go to the wall im not sure what brienne will get up to it feels like theyve got her out of kings landing but dont really know where her arc will go next what is happening with the grey joys arent they meant to be in open rebellion "

"520" "Knowslittle" 2014-05-06 " barristan selmy is actually a bit of a fool and i like that i think its interesting that he has this reputation as a great and noble knight but his advice is basically rubbish hes a military man good for winning battles and duels theres no reason he should be good at the games of power all the knights weve seen have been pretty dim whether they were good and noble or vile and reprehensible as for the iron bank  the preview for next weeks episode makes it clear we will be seeing one of their representatives "
"521" "Gammelpreusse" 2014-05-06 " expect more of the slow pace with singular more exiting events here and there thrown in but nothing like the pace of the firtst three seasons its the same in the books the last one got a lot of critique for exactly that reason a lack of story development but i suppose its just the quite before the storm with martin setting up the pieces "
"522" "Rotimi Fawole" 2014-05-06 " definitely has pacing issues nowhere near as brisk or as engaging as the first 3 seasons were hopeful the mrs and i that these first 5 episodes are setting up the remainder of the season for some full throttle high drama "
"523" "Catch22" 2014-05-06 " is mance rayder going to light a fire so big it melts the wall "
"524" "Catch22" 2014-05-06 " my concern and its really a minor one is that theyre juggling a lot of storylines with five eps left and certain characters to me at least appear to be treading water i kind of like the treading water parts though to me they seem quite realistic wandering around westeros is probably pretty dull most of the time so for me it adds a bit of realism yes i know in a show with ice zombies and dragons amongst other assorted batsht crazy things "
"525" "MonkEMan" 2014-05-06 " revealing baelish and lysas plotting so very early was a terrible move  makes me think thaey are going to bring the show to an early conclusion separated from the books "
"526" "liquefry" 2014-05-06 " totally agree  and with the comments below too it will become more difficult to keep the show engaging and progressing the underlying story from the books is pretty slow at this point in the series and not as easy to translate to screen on another point i thought the highlight of this weeks ep was aryas bold inclusion of the hound on her list she is one tough little cookie "
"527" "Catch22" 2014-05-06 " jon snow knows nothing ah yes good point i had not factored this into my calculations "
"528" "shambala" 2014-05-06 " jorah did say to danerys theyve been fighting jofferys wars for years alluding to the passage of a fair chunk of time "
"529" "Rich1991" 2014-05-06 " locke then somehow got past moat cailin held by the greyjoys to arrive at the dreadfort in episode 2 of this season roose bolton mentions this during his conversation with bastardreek something about having to sneak into my own land "
"530" "roganis" 2014-05-06 " i just think we should be feeling the same about tyrion i feel concerned about tyrion however since ned and the red wedding ive hardened myself as im sure others have to the sad fact that favs may get it in the neck btw ive only started reading the books so dont know what happens next but cerseis chessplaying of various characters emotions and ambitions gives me cause for worry all she has to do now is give jaime a cuddle and it may be checkmate "
"531" "kingmaker" 2014-05-06 " just like in blackadder d "
"532" "bobbymac1956" 2014-05-06 " dany also had a new frock  she was in danger of becoming a bit of a minger  "
"533" "bobbymac1956" 2014-05-06 " the timeline does have difficulties  the speed various people travel from a to b in westeros can in some cases appear strange dany for instance seems to speed along but arya seems to take forever getting about in the books it is much more linear with the baton of story telling being passed from character to character as for brans spurt of growth  this is always the danger with child actors the worst being i think is in outnumbered with one child suddenly turning into hodor and the older boy apparently shrinking and turning elf "
"534" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-06 " i didnt say it was too slow i said it had pacing issues those are two different things "
"535" "Rich1991" 2014-05-06 " did tywin essentially reveal the lannisters are broke no more gold to be dug up none for the last 3 years he said oh dear "

"537" "HexagonSon" 2014-05-06 " i may be being utterly dense but can someone please explain to me why the martells are being allowed to hang around at kings landing given the animosity between them and the lannisters is it simply a case of tywin wanting to keep his enemies close "
"538" "AlanTyndall" 2014-05-06 " one problem is the lack of content from the books it slowed up to fill in a lot of backstory local colour characters tie off old plots and start new ones i suspect well see a few more invented story lines to cover the gap "
"539" "venerablejohn" 2014-05-06 " that said i do wonder about the geography north of the wall – mance and co must be planning the worlds slowest attack on castle black given that jon has now made it back to the nights watch hung around getting abused and headed back to crasters keep all without the wildling army getting their act together how many families do thenns need to eat before they can launch an attack what exactly is manse spending his time doing mance has to move an army of 10s of thousands and john doesnt that would probably go a way to explaining it wasnt the point of shutting down craster to stop mance finding out hes only facing jon a big wolf and a few old geezers wrapped in dodgy rugs hes under the impression that the black watch is as of old and so hes probably reluctant to attack "
"540" "VonSparron" 2014-05-06 " agreed although the books take on a nonlinear narrative and events happen concurrently so being in book 5 doesnt necessarily mean they live that much longer "
"541" "VonSparron" 2014-05-06 " the characters are younger in the books but they always refer to their xth name day which isnt necessarily the same as what we think of as a birthday the wildlings for instance dont name their children until they are 2 years old presumably due to the high infant mortality rates so a character celebrating their 13th name day could conceivably be 15 years old "
"542" "MinerWilly" 2014-05-06 " he had my favourite line yet a couple of weeks ago when he said who the feck is jon snow  "
"543" "bobbymac1956" 2014-05-06 " i remember being at school with a boy whos mother would appear every day rain or shine at play time and he would go to a corner of the school fence  old style railings  she would through the bars shroud him in her big black coat  and as i found out later feed him he was older than me probably ten or so  so it does actually happen i think i read somewhere that as long as milk is being drawn the mother will continue to produce  as it is with cows  "
"544" "topher12" 2014-05-06 " that said i do wonder about the geography north of the wall – mance and co must be planning the worlds slowest attack on castle black given that jon has now made it back to the nights watch hung around getting abused and headed back to crasters keep all without the wildling army getting their act together how many families do thenns need to eat before they can launch an attack what exactly is manse spending his time doing mance has to move an army of 10s of thousands and john doesnt that would probably go a way to explaining it "
"545" "Buckers70" 2014-05-06 " one does not simply warg into hodor "
"546" "VonSparron" 2014-05-06 " they have survived long enough without being killed by the white walkers did seem a bit short sighted to burn their house down though even if maybe it didnt hold the happiest memories "

"548" "bjammin187" 2014-05-06 " too slow for you sarah need more action i got two words for you michael goddamn bay ok thats three words "
"549" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-06 " thats a really good point and i like it "
"550" "VonSparron" 2014-05-06 " desperate times etc personally i was shouting at the tv for bran to possess karl and make him stab himself in his own face "
"551" "VonSparron" 2014-05-06 " me too its a very immersive world thats great to drop in and out of as you pick up the books i just wonder if weve got to the point where it doesnt translate to tv very well anymore i think there are going to have to be some wholesale changes to the book otherwise the only people left watching it will be the hardcore fanbase "
"552" "Katheartsboo" 2014-05-06 " he could but he probably wouldnt due to some antiquated law of chivalry "
"553" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-06 " ive read the books many times i can still dream "
"554" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-06 " i take your point about the wildings also the cersei scenes were excellent but for me at least the pace seemed a little slack  although as mentioned that might be due to the time i watched the show "
"555" "birney" 2014-05-06 " i am confused about just how old oberyns sister was given she had several children with the king before he left her for daenerys mother how old is daenerys anyway and did her dead obnoxious older brother have the same mother i could read the books but im too old and dont have enough life left for that "
"556" "Dewulf" 2014-05-06 " but in any writing be it movie tv novel if you dont actually see the person die and in worse cases sometimes even when you do you cant assume 100 knowledge of death that doesnt mean the opposite mind you  but you cant cross off the possibility syrio is out there regarding trant at blackwater theres nothing to say syrio couldnt have impeded him somehow and made an escape leaving trant alive also it was only trant at that point  the others had been rendered senseless the only other theory on syrio is that hes jaqenfor me thats a little too coincidental but id happily speculate that syrio and jaqen might be linked somehow eg working for the same boss could even be the iron bank or syrio was also a faceless man and that syrio is still around waiting for another storyline to play out "
"557" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-06 " well now i thought long and hard about this because heres the thing  i had to watch this episode at 6am and then write the recap in a mad rush to get it over in time with bank holiday and i do wonder if that affected my viewing of it when i watched it again last night i felt more kindly towards it but as mentioned above i do think there are a couple of things that should feel more tense than they do  notably tyrions situation "
"558" "roganis" 2014-05-06 " all these characters are younger in the books than the tv show these books were written for the lion witch and wardroade crowd or the harry potter age group er heres a quote from the first book  “how would you like to die tyrion son of tywin” “in my own bed with a belly full of wine and a maiden’s mouth around my cock at the age of eighty” he replied” sorry i cant remember anything similar in harry potter "
"559" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-06 " ha yes he could perhaps fool was a bit harsh but honestly im not convinced by his advice i have a feeling hes a little too concerned with the old ways at the expense of seeing the right path "
"560" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-06 " ha and of course its one reason why i love got and am not a lotr fan im all for character development hell i watched the whole of rubicon which was pretty much nothing but slowpaced character development and cersei in particular benefitted from last nights episode but heres where i have a problem  in season one neds arrest was filled with tension we genuinely cared what happened to him and i just think we should be feeling the same about tyrion but instead weve had one brief albeit very well done scene with jaime and thats it i dont feel as though theres as much invested in that storyline as there should be and i have a similar issue with the pacing surrounding the wilding attack an issue which i think is caused by a slight slackening of tension at the wrong moments that said these are for me anyway really minor points i love hanging out in westeros i like spending time with different characters and i also think slowing down the pace at times isnt a bad idea "
"561" "VonSparron" 2014-05-06 " this was one of my favourite episodes of this season nice to catch up with mad old aunty lysa who did some good exposition for us so little finger has been behind well basically everything all along i do still wonder about littlefingers motives he obviously wants the power but seemed none too keen on actually having to go through with the marriage to lady arryn i loved the scene with arya and the hound i did wonder if maybe she had forgiven him but no hes still on her hit list what is cersei up to she was being far too nice in this episode it was very unnerving it must have been frustrating for everyone who wants danny to high tail it over to kings landing and set fire to everything shes finally got and army shes finally got ships shes finally going to sail to the seven kingdoms oh no wait shes just going to hang out in mereen all the stuff at crasters keep was great freaky jojen being freaky locke getting snapped in half by hodor a suitably grisly end to the jon snow boss fight i do wonder if any of that was really necessary though i suppose it was better than more scenes of bran walking through a forest and did make their story feel a bit more connected to everything else that was going on i do worry from this point on if the show is going to become too stretched there are so many characters off doing there own thing and we dont really have a focal point anymore i mean what is stannis up to what about the brotherhood without banners anyone even remember them where is the king beyond the wall what are the greyjoys doing last we saw yara was going to free theon im probably forgetting about someone important too plus there is a whole heap of major players we havent even met yet "
"562" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-06 " very amusing but even as a book reader i have no idea what will happen next anybody could die especially if theyre a beloved minor character "
"563" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-06 " true  i almost put a bit in about that but im trying to avoid book references in the recap i actually like the meandering nature of the books and as mentioned below i like the character development on the show but i think there are also potential issues "
"564" "MancunianPsycho" 2014-05-06 " i missed a very entertaining football match last night for this episode and had i watched the football id have missed nothing tommen is kingdany isnt going to attackjon snow attacked crasters keeppeter is lord of the vale and has basically kidnapped sansa the show started off with every episode completely gripping but has basically slowed to a halt "
"565" "BoboftheSouth" 2014-05-06 " phew  deancharles chapman bsept 7 1997 who plays tommen is barely legal so im not a dirty old poove "
"566" "crasspymctabernacle" 2014-05-06 " youve got that wrong  for some reason i was modded for speculating that jon snow is lysas son and that this appealed to me because the fascinating unsavoury implications of this appealed to a sick fuck like me and for some equally unknown reason my follow up post wasnt modded "
"567" "Dewulf" 2014-05-06 " i think its a bit of bothremember lord baellish seemed to be quite knowledgeable when instructing ros and her companion on the finer points of turning someone on eeaase into it lol at the same time lysa definitely appears to be someone wholl build the hype she wants out of nothing if need be so no doubt for her wedding night shell hype herself into a bedroom opera because of course shes now with her one true love amirite heh heh yeah well thats what she thinks "
"568" "Yildinator" 2014-05-06 " all robin ever does is drink his mums tit milk "
"569" "rpghellin" 2014-05-06 " a breath of fresh air for the show is always welcomed but we will be in dire need for that next season if youve read the books you know what comes next is not as amusing about stannis we both know what happens and i would ask you to rewatch the last episodes of series 3 to see what stannis planned to do but is putting off this season for no apparent reason whatsoever "
"570" "Cariad007" 2014-05-06 " yes lets hope the iron bank is more forgiving than the black monks or else a turnip may find itself on the wrong side of tywin "
"571" "MightyMightyMan" 2014-05-06 " iron bank the bank that likes to say death "
"572" "liquefry" 2014-05-06 " on a more serious note this is a wider show problem – every scene this week was well acted and cleverly done but apart from the destruction of crasters keep and the revelation that petyr baelish is pulling all the strings all the time what actually occurred just means the show is being faithful to the books i enjoy reading them but the story moves at snails pace and only seems to slow down over time "
"573" "Katheartsboo" 2014-05-06 " yeah initially i thought it was a bit unprofessional but lord littlefinger of the wandering accent is growing on me im choosing to believe that hes doing it on purpose no more having to posh up the accent for court "

"578" "Aelfwine" 2014-05-06 " theres exciting stuff for everyone in adwd and affc eventually and a lot of not terribly eventful though interesting chapters before that besides for some characters were already going into these books this season i think most of the adwdaffc stories will be done by the end of season 5 "

"580" "roganis" 2014-05-06 " id take tbe relative safety of the eyrie with a kings landing dungeon any day i see your point re littlefinger but i guess i was thinking that theres a better chance of escape if you were in the kings landing dungeon than the eyrie with the latter youre stuck with lysa and robin however with tyrion not being in this episode i have my worries that we are being weaned off his appearances in preparation for his demise "
"581" "imperium3" 2014-05-06 " and not just jon arya also sometimes has dreams of her direwolf nymeria who dont forget is still alive its a bit unclear for rickon and shaggydog but quite likely given how similar the two are also i would lay good odds on the books finishing with rickon the wild wolf stark as lord of the north "
"582" "elscollonsdelgos" 2014-05-06 " excellent  reminded me of 70s leeds not enough swearing this week for my liking also for a street fighter he took his eye off a very alive john snow to focus on the woman who stuck the knife in his back "
"583" "imperium3" 2014-05-06 " pretty much yes shes not too much different than the books i always thought dany was hugely overrated still things may look up a bit in the future  "
"584" "DidoTwite" 2014-05-06 " i love pod and brienne but i thought the direction was a bit weird in their campfire scene there were a couple of shots of them from afar that seemed to imply they were being watched but they were obviously just directorial choices very weird the long shots unnerved me a bit when i should have just been enjoying the dialogue "

"599" "elscollonsdelgos" 2014-05-06 " i think the series like the books has lost its tension the extension of the series universe has been accompanied with a loss of focus on what the series was originally about  a power struggle for dominion in westeros now there are too few events per programme driving the plot along and too many repeated scenes  the houndarya scenes have worn thin perhaps two would have been enough when danaerys says shes going to stay and rule i though no no go and attack kings landing otherwise nothings going to happen still very well made but i feel and i can away and do something else and come back and wont have missed a lot that didnt happen before "
"600" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2014-05-06 " i dont understand the problem with this change of pace if they didnt do so the criticism would be the show is too onepaced favouring breathless development over quiet character moments thats the problem when things get too popular  critics feel the need to put the boot in just cos i thought this was another excellent episode and looking at the preview things will ramp up again next week "

"604" "edwardelric" 2014-05-06 " about the pacing seasons 5 and 6 were signed game of thrones costs a lot of money and is making a lot of money i hope that was no a spoiler cause i like to think of the show as real too but when i see obvious twists to slow it down i remember it is not "

"607" "rpghellin" 2014-05-06 " no spoilers here just the truth this season is slowing down one of the fastestpaced most thrilling and compelling parts of the plot i wont unveil the events but i expected tyrions trial to be between 34th episode why waiting any longer now i watch the show and wonder if he is starving in his cell instead of picking up and get on with the huge amount of events coming up it seems to me theyve decided to play authorship and make up stuff crasters hut attack huh or stress characters that have a bigger role in a foreseeable future briene or brian all happens in kings landing in the show but nothing happens at all too sad we havent a clue about stannis either and weve yet to make room for slight spoiler here dornes inhabitants and others spoiler end to sum up a bit slow for my taste compelling anyway but miles away from the books btw prince oberyn is really cool in the series theyve depicted him just as i imagined even the broad spanish accent "

"610" "HonestIago" 2014-05-06 " i hope despite the fact the evidence is against me syrio escaped i really want syrio to be alive maybe he simply knocked trant out and sauntered away no running for the first sword of braavos "

"617" "Silgen" 2014-05-06 " most of those characters are younger in the books than in the tv show they were aged up mainly because of the restrictions on working with child actors limited hours must have tutor on set etc some danaerys because of the sex scenes they were involved in everything else you have written from martins motivations who the books are aimed at the content of the books even the genre they belong to is complete garbage "

"740" "ronsonol" 2014-05-06 " that look between tommen and margaery and then cersei literally cock blocking her son  i missed that it was always in the cards she likes to keep hercom close b r other son lets call the while thing off "
"741" "wonderscience2000" 2014-05-06 " jojen reeds visions wereodd his hand aflame and the sweats seems to mean hes got a fever of some kind the entire bran storyline is actually bollocks  hes not a warg and theres no 3eyed raven theyre just a bunch of tweens wandering around in the wilderness eating entirely the wrong sort of mushrooms "
"742" "wonderscience2000" 2014-05-06 " yeah theres a season and a halfs worth of tv left in the books for sure no more than that though "
"743" "wonderscience2000" 2014-05-06 " he wants everything oh everything there is this includes accents "
"744" "Knowles2" 2014-05-06 " he could still be alive he could be character that convince arya that she doesnt have to kill everyone on her list i figure could have enough friends in high places to get him out of trouble "
"745" "hdtvdaly" 2014-05-06 " and yet its still superior to his accent in lovehate when his lawyer had a scaldier dublin accent than aidans gangster "
"746" "wonderscience2000" 2014-05-06 " hed lose his mind  become just one more dire wolf and an inanimate human shell they talked about this at the start of the season when they warned him about spending too much time in animals heads "
"747" "Knowles2" 2014-05-06 " i hear they got ways of dealing with people that wonder about such things "
"748" "rickyredmanc" 2014-05-06 " sad  yeah come to think of it yes well noticed since this series has started ive come to the conclusion that the hound is by far the more interesting of the two "
"749" "OldhamA" 2014-05-06 " when syrio was owning lannister guards with that wooden stick it didnt look daft arya has barely started her training so shes obviously not going to be a master at it "
"750" "00jebus" 2014-05-06 " timelines between books 34 and 5 get a bit messy though pov characters in 4 and 5 are split geographically and take place mostly concurrently we can guess that next season we will see far more of the greyjoys finally get to know an answer to 1 mystery and the dornish aryas arc will probably be expanded too well i hope so since they went to all the trouble of building the sets and who doesnt love arya "
"751" "rickyredmanc" 2014-05-06 " ive seen dan weiss and dave benioff on youtube say they are looking at 7 or 8 seasons but even that doesnt seem enough next book is a feast for crows a book just as fun packed as its predecessor two series for that book  seems a good idea to me a dance with dragons is another busy volume then theres the two that arent published yet winds of winter and a dream of spring the last two books will go up a couple of gears hopefully anyway for the climax to a song of ice and fire however hbo might not want to shell out for 9 or 10 series and have told the showrunners that 8 series will have to suffice who knows  "
"752" "Knowles2" 2014-05-06 " at least until he old enough to give sansa stark a kid and then he go and attempt to fly himself "
"753" "MightyMightyMan" 2014-05-06 " david benioff in entertainment weekly “it feels like this is the midpoint for us” benioff says “if we’re going to go seven seasons which is the plan season 4 is right down the middle the pivot point” "
"754" "Knowles2" 2014-05-06 " i did as well it certainly wrong for bran to keep using him like that catch22 randombloke 05 may 2014 742pm recommend10im waiting for bran to possess a dragon arent we all of cause dany needs to say something bitchy but sort of funny first of all before bran demonstrates she isnt the only one able to control the dragons "
"755" "OldhamA" 2014-05-06 " thats one long piss "
"756" "Simgeo" 2014-05-06 " i couldnt help thinking a couple of episodes back when bran had his vision at the tree only to come to the conclusion that he needed to go north i just wanted meera to leap across and throttle him yelling we are going north weve been going north for so long we cant remember why were going north and your sodding wolf has just ran off with our dinner again why you little "
"757" "00jebus" 2014-05-06 " huh hadnt thought of that would be a nice twist and mean he conveniently doesnt have to fight ygritte "
"758" "Silgen" 2014-05-06 " service with a smile and a stab theyd fit right in to game of thrones "
"759" "MightyMightyMan" 2014-05-06 " it was predictable but sad when arya finished the list of doomed of men with the hound i dont think it was that unconvincing that is how highborns are taught to fight airy fairy and no dirty tricks "
"760" "00jebus" 2014-05-06 " no see above two posts in addition oberyns daughters are natural born not true born all 8 are bastards not with the same mother thus would not be seen as a bad match oberyn does have a sister who might be a good match esp since dornish succession law land and titles pass to the oldest child not the oldest boy but would greatly annoy the tyrells who hate the martels and the religious who think the dornish are sinful libertines "
"761" "splazsh" 2014-05-06 " i dont think anyone has ever said they would finish after 7 seasons "
"762" "splazsh" 2014-05-05 " this was the best episode of the season every scene was excellent it had great dialogue action and vital information was revealed considering some of the episodes there have been in the past i find it bizarre that anyone would pick on this one as not having much happen in it i was really taken aback by the littlefinger  john arryn revelation that possibility had never crossed my mind at all perhaps because i hadnt given it that much thought since early on in season one i keep thinking of the chaos as a ladder speech and how many huge events all came as a result of that one murder "
"763" "Simgeo" 2014-05-05 " you know stannis i am a colossal pervert animal vegetable mineral ill do anything to anything "
"764" "rickyredmanc" 2014-05-05 " 7 seasons doesnt make sense its not enough were on the 4th season already on the 3rd book "
"765" "00jebus" 2014-05-05 " there was also no nudity in the purple wedding episode and the amount seems to be decreasing with each series on the other hand oberyn orgy "
"766" "MightyMightyMan" 2014-05-05 " for final jeopardy what do the kardashians use to enter a building "
"767" "splazsh" 2014-05-05 " yes he was sent to find the two stark boys made quite a mess of it though didnt he "
"768" "MightyMightyMan" 2014-05-05 " they are planning 7 seasons of the tv series the producers say there will be no year off sabbaticals wont they be finished before the books "
"769" "00jebus" 2014-05-05 " why doesnt bran just hang out at the wall and warg his dog up to the tree up north because warged summer cant talk which is important given what is coming for bran and means dd would have to come up with a way of telling the story with what would effectively be a silent protagonist "
"770" "Silgen" 2014-05-05 " being a warg is a genetic ability bran has honed his abilities from being bedridden and having nothing else to do its not just that traditionally in story and legend a shaman gains power by being crippled or deformed in some way its a kind of sacrifice think of odin hanging from the tree for nine days and sacrificing an eye to be able to see the past present and future probably all the stark children have the ability to warg into their direwolves when dreaming but bran became much more powerful than that when he was crippled "
"771" "St1bs" 2014-05-05 " the most pressing question for me isdoes prince oberyn actually own any other clothes hes been wearing that yellow coat since he arrived in kings landing and for an unknown period prior to that it must be stinking by now "
"772" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-05-05 " no i think hes dead if he wasnt then trant would have been and he lived until the blackwater when last we saw him he was facing an amoured kingsgaurd and two men with only a toothpick left to defend himselfnbsp i think the hound has it right all aryas father figures die ned syrio yoren the hound should watch his back "
"773" "neiltsm" 2014-05-05 " on a more positive note going on previous eligibility rules the fact petyr was born and bred westeros but has now taken on a mysterious irish accent should be good enough to qualify him to play for the republic of ireland in the next world cup "
"774" "jonnywishbone" 2014-05-05 " re crasters keep slynt and thorne basically sent jon there to his death because they fear he is becoming too popular and thorne is only acting lord commander now that hes emerged victorious it seems safe to assume hell return to castle black even more of a hero and a bigger pain in allisers arse "

"780" "jonnywishbone" 2014-05-05 " when we first saw littlefinger this season i assumed the actor was simply terrible at accents but now it seems clear that the portrayal is a deliberate attempt to further demonstrate that his whole persona in kings landing is a facade were now seeing the real lord baelish "

"783" "aliquidcow" 2014-05-05 " i felt the same about the dany scene in last weeks episode sort of although it was significant what happened with her last week i found it interesting that the scene was right at the start of the episode and that was it from her for that week as if they were just getting the dany bit out the way and moving on "
"784" "SheriffFatman" 2014-05-05 " i work with a jaime "
"785" "Silgen" 2014-05-05 " i think littlefingers wandering accent suits his character probably none of them are his real original accent hes been putting on false accents so long lying to himself and others that hes forgotten what his original accent was "

"787" "pipdog" 2014-05-05 " i also have to disagree with sarah this didnt feel like a holding episode at all it laid the foundation for a whole new set of rivalries in kings landing and kicked off an intriguing storyline involving the mad lysa it also saw the end of crasters keep and started to develop what looks like another entertaining road partnership this time involving brienne and pod as for mancess advance on the wall  exactly how fast is a huge army of illdisciplined wildings complete with camp followers going to move not very fast at all compared to a few men of the nights watch on horses "
"788" "adamabyss" 2014-05-05 " what a snorefest of an episode im not talking about action or lack thereof but a lot of the scenes were just pointless with bad dialogue "
"789" "Muppet_N2" 2014-05-05 " in the book its clear that hodor gets terrified and bran who do it repeatedly tries to explain him its just for a moment evading the thought of just not doing it "

"794" "Lingli" 2014-05-05 " you make a really good point about the characterdriven development vs plotdriven  i hadnt really thought of that and it makes me less impatient about some of the scenes i did think whats the point of this when we first started with pod and brienne for example but yes it shows a little more of who they are how thats picked up as their story develops ill wait to see i still dont really see the point of the whole crasters keep arc however i mean i see its purpose in giving both bran and jon something to do for a couple of episodes but in terms of advancing either the plot or the characters i find it a bit thin partly i think this is because i liked jon so much in the books and i really loved the scenes at the wall but both have fallen a bit flat on the show kit harrington looks great but i dont think he always conveys the complexity of the character maybe again thats an impossible ask given that jon has pov chapters or maybe its just because hes surrounded by so many absolutely awesome actors "
"795" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-05 " there is one storyline that troubles me though i dont want to write any spoilers but if i remember the books correctly there is a certain character who ought to be dead by now or at least we ought to believe hes dead and yet hes still appearing regularly im assuming his death has simply been delayed and will happen sometime between now and the end of the season but im intrigued worried to see where the writers are going with this no i think timelinewise they are on with this they have just changed the order of what happens slightly but that isnt unusual "

"800" "MRONeill" 2014-05-05 " i think the issue with danys scene in this episode is just that  it was a scene maybe five minutes long it seemed misplaced or at a minimum oddly placed to me  that it couldve very easily been put in an entirely different episode perhaps one in which we returned to her plot line again in the same episode we just didnt need to know this episode that shes going to remain in mereen and i think those minutes were better spent with cersei oberyn arya or even bran and clan "
"801" "EnglishMike" 2014-05-05 " i dont think you can blame the show for the pacing its not as though the books are brimming with eyesearing action at this stage as it is they left out thankfully sansas stopover at littlefingers home on the way to the eyrie the fact that you have major characters wandering around the countryside for whole books at a time doesnt make their job of adapting this long rambling epic into an actionpacked tv show any easier i think theyre doing a fine job so far but it doesnt get any easier after this season i suspect well be hearing a lot more complaints by this time next year "
"802" "Nick Kitson" 2014-05-05 " ha "
"803" "DetachNgo" 2014-05-05 " i liked how the story earned pod that little bit of respect from brienne "

"805" "DetachNgo" 2014-05-05 " is hodor aware of what is happening when bran wargs into him or did he lose consciousness and then suddenly regained it to find blood on his hands not knowing what had just happened "

"808" "fozziebearish" 2014-05-05 " im assuming his death has simply been delayed and will happen sometime between now and the end of the season but im intrigued worried to see where the writers are going with this yes ive been boring my non book reading friends about this i can only assume that because said character is so popular theyre drawing it out  possibly wont even take that plot arc at all "
"809" "Spacedone" 2014-05-05 " id say that this episode wasnt so much a holding episode but rather an episode where the groundwork for a couple of future storylines was quietly slipped in without fanfare or remark i prefer it when theyre being subtle rather than all basil exposition my favourite part of the episode was where locke had his neck snapped by branpossessed hodor the conflicted reaction of hodor to bran after what hed just donebeen forced to do was beautiful hodors a gentle childlike soul and bran just made him a killer "
"810" "Thulcandra" 2014-05-05 " or tommy carcetti becoming mayor of baltimore even  "

"812" "MRONeill" 2014-05-05 " very very true  by sympathetic i mean that we are being made to understand more and more why she is the way that she is i dont trust her at all nor do i trust her father who surely has his reasons for taking cersei into his conversational confidence this past episode aside from the fact that one son is in the black cells and the other hes disowned "
"813" "HashRouge" 2014-05-05 " i thought that was a slightly odd episode we seemed to get through a lot of scenes and drop in on a lot of characters without a lot actually happening as sarah said im not sure we got much plot advancement im finding danys scenes increasingly unsatisfying although im not entirely sure why i think it is probably partly to do with the white saviour image which i know has been picked up on by quite a lot of people this series i also think that dany emilia was better when she was striving to become a queen but shes not so good at being a queen im not sure if this is a problem with the actress or with the character and the way that shes written i also struggle to sympathise with understand brans quest for the three eyed raven its been going on for so long that i cant really remember why hes looking for the three eyed raven or what the point of this whole storyline is i was desperately hoping for a reunion with jon and so when meera or jojen cant remember which one told him that jon wouldnt let him continue looking for the raven i was like who caresthat all sounds really negative  dont get me wrong i love the show its really only those two elements that bother me hugely so thats probably partly why i was unsure about this episodei liked the kings landing scenes with cersei  i think lena headey has been consistently brilliant in this role and it was nice to see oberyn doing something that didnt involve brothels naked people there is one storyline that troubles me though i dont want to write any spoilers but if i remember the books correctly there is a certain character who ought to be dead by now or at least we ought to believe hes dead and yet hes still appearing regularly im assuming his death has simply been delayed and will happen sometime between now and the end of the season but im intrigued worried to see where the writers are going with this "

"815" "hoover2001" 2014-05-05 " being more sympathetic doesnt mean shes still not conniving tywins admission that the lannisters and the crown are in major debt is the driving force behind the wooing of the rich tyrells even though shes trying to manipulate margeary it comes from the love she has for her children im sure cersei will do something terrible soon enough probably in the next episode "

"818" "JRF314159" 2014-05-05 " excellent episode and i think the author of this blog has it wrong certainly this week felt a little bit like a holding episode in which we dropped in on numerous characters without really advancing the story much i think this episode was actually a great change of pace from the last few and advanced the story much farther than the past couple have the dominos from joffries death fell one by one in westeros the dragon ladys plot is starting to get interesting what with her having to do more than just free more slaves and move on i was genuinely surprised and impressed by the depths of littlefingers meddling and seeing hodor save bran was a truly cathartic moment and resolved lockes machinations and revealed brans destiny as opaque as it is "
"819" "DrGiggles" 2014-05-05 " im loving the series on a scene by scene basis but must admit theres a lack of building tension anyone feeling the imminent threat of a willing attack me neither nothing much doing in mehreen the bolton subplot has gone awol tyrions trial not exactly bubbling as said it doesnt stop me loving the series but agree with the reviewer that the pace needs picked up "
"820" "UndyingCincinnatus" 2014-05-05 " i agree  to be honest watching the last few episodes has been kind of like reading the books at this point its all interesting but you kind of just want something to happen at some point i suppose that means its keeping well to the source material though "

"827" "MRONeill" 2014-05-05 " very much agree on all counts  making her a bit more sympathetic is interesting and she is doing a fantastic job  and her comment about little girls being hurt everywhere were heart wrenching the scene with margery was particularly fascinating especially given their past interactions her admission i know not the first but certainly the first to an outsider that joffery was a monster was oddly impressive there is a part of me that still thinks shes trying to set margery up for something  but its also possible she believes that someone else could better guide tommen than she "
"828" "hoover2001" 2014-05-05 " the awful story from nigeria was the first thing i thought about in that scene an accurate statement that is still sadly true to this day "
"829" "MRONeill" 2014-05-05 " this was the first interaction between arya and the hound where i thought that perhaps the tables would turn and sooner rather than later arya will be teaching the hound a thing or two he doesnt take her seriously enough and although she had a chance to kill him herself or allow him to be killed back during the poliver dust upshes keeping him in her name of people to knock off "

"833" "hoover2001" 2014-05-05 " i liked every scene that cersei was in this episode against my better judgement i liked cersei in the books she may have been a terrible person but the world made her that way the show has cast her in a more sympathetic and even poignant light adding a complexity that isnt as apparent in the books it helps that lena headey is absolutely killing it "

"844" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-05 " i get vaguely reassuring actually perhaps unnerving would have been a better choice of word than creepy also while i do think they have a slight issue with pacing similar to that in season 2 i didnt mean to imply the episode was slow as such i think every series has to have the odd breather episode where we take a bit of time out before pushing on through the final stretch my concern and its really a minor one is that theyre juggling a lot of storylines with five eps left and certain characters to me at least appear to be treading water "
"845" "mikebhoy" 2014-05-05 " i loved the exchange between cersei and tywin where they were discussing marrying tommen off a fortnight "

"854" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-05 " i dont know how littlefinger getting raped by lysa somehow became lysa raped by littlefinger but i think its a telling reaction perhaps youve read one too many articles by the guardian "

"864" "Catch22" 2014-05-05 " i didnt think the episode was slow at all we learned some very important things such as who killed john arryn and the lannisters are completely broke and so stuff was set up for the next few weeks like what is cersei planning with that ship oh and i dont find jojen creepy hes vaguely reassuring but then maybe im weird "

"867" "SarahHughes" 2014-05-05 " i nearly mentioned that because i also hated the scene between karl  meera although i do think it served to reiterate cerseis point about little girls all over the world "

"869" "Peter Roe" 2014-05-05 " think of the arc of the season being like the arc of a large cannonball fired from a powerful canon at the start of the season it was explosively let loose and has now reached its zenith before starting its descent in what will be an explosive and chaotic ending whatever its target may be "

"871" "Zepp" 2014-05-05 " that does bring up the question of the passage of time in the series in the story since the death of the hand theres been time for robert to ride to westeros several months of palace intrigue cumulating in roberts beheading from there tensions rise and eventually a civil war is fought those usually take a few years especially when everyones walking or on horseback i think its safe to assume that several years have passed in the story i saw an interview with a slightly ascerbic martin who advised everyone to quit worrying about the erratic schedule of winter and just read the damn stories and so its reasonable to assume that a ten year old bran five years later might be a 15 year old teenager "
"872" "aliquidcow" 2014-05-05 " ive usually defended the show against people who criticise it for its rape scenes but this week i got so fed up with rape or the threat of rape being used as a plot device its probably just because the whole crasters keep setting in these last two episodes has been so overthetop and badly done while not contributing an awful lot "
"873" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-05-05 " yeah but with petyr ive got your number baelish hanging around i dont fancy little robins chances for seeing many more name days "

"877" "aliquidcow" 2014-05-05 " what happened to syrio i am certain that syrio is not dead we did not actually see him die if youll excuse the in the book comment i was sure when reading the first novel that syrio didnt get killed because of the way it was depicted hes left to fight several enemies while arya runs away we dont see what happens when i watched the show i noticed that it was done in exactly he same way which leads me to believe that its significant that we dont see him die "

"885" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-05 " i think cersei knows the influence the fairer sex has on the men in the tyrell family her conversation with margaery was meant to remind the tyrells that joffreys murder is still unavenged and if both families are going to form an alliance theyll need to put joffreys trial behind them no matter if tyrion is guilty or not as for mace tyrell who knows you say hes dedicated but weve barely heard two words from him and nothing on the upcoming trial the only descriptions of mace weve heard so far is his mother calling him an idiot and tyrion saying that hes in tywins pocket "

"888" "swisschocolate" 2014-05-05 " yea i did like to see that she was finally brought down a peg or several after seemingly going from triumph to triumph made her a bit more realistic was basically saying she could get a break from the screen now while she putters about slavers bay to fix the messes shes made "
"889" "Sammed" 2014-05-05 " dany needed this crucial climax to realize that her predestiny is terrible if she cant even rule one city the climax was not that obvious but mind you also dany is supposed to be a teenager here after this you can complain about her scenes where she basically talks in circles for most of the 5th book "
"890" "Machine2481" 2014-05-05 " how long before jorah realises the daenerys doesnt reciprocate his feelings and decides to act on his own loyalty is a fabulous thing but his is strengthened by infatuation and while im not suggesting that he will automatically turn his back on her whenif he realises he wont succeed in wooing her he does have previous of being willing to contemplate moving against her for the then king robert in return for an end to his exilealso hes kinda getting on my nerves so i hope he does something out of character soon "

"892" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-05-05 " i wouldnt say barristans a fool but he does possess a ridiculously outdated code of honour he looked the other way while the mad king raped tortured and murdered he probably would have stood by and let aerys set kings landing ablaze all for his own sense of honor and to be honest he wasnt a very good bodyguard both rhaegar and robert died while he was supposedly protecting them ned and robb were steadfast in their beliefs and its arguably what got them killed but as barristan gets older his code of honour becomes more malleable which is probably why hes still alive and why hes such an interesting character when danys group was challenged by the champion of meereen he offered to take challenge saying i think ive got one good fight left in me hes confident is his abilities but hes also realistic in his chances against a much younger heavily armoured foe atop a horse barristan might have been foolish at the start of the series but ever since robert died under his protection hes been more aware of that fact that honour alone is not enough to survive in this world "

"894" "swisschocolate" 2014-05-05 " for 1 for him marrying the lady of the vale is a huge step up socially no matter how mad she is 2 wondered about that too why not just tell him shes littlefingers niece aleyse or whatever she was introduced as first maybe because lysa and petyr are hatching wedding plans for them and he needs to know that hes marrying a stark 3 im quite convinced shes going to off loras somehow ever since hes goaded renly into a silly war in season one hes only been pretty wallpaper so very expendable "

"896" "Machine2481" 2014-05-05 " wary using what dragons draagons yes i do believe i recognise that word however as all ive seen of the supposed mother of dragons these past weeks is bloody repetitive politics im taking what you meant as bran will warg into politicians to bore the lannisters to death while becoming increasingly vexed that there is no one to heroically set free from slaverly "
"897" "Tayside" 2014-05-05 " thats because they disappear from the books as well presumably until the next volume gets published "
"898" "cybersuperhero" 2014-05-05 " did you miss the bit where cersei agreed with tywin that tommen would marry margaery "
"899" "cybersuperhero" 2014-05-05 " i dont think cerseis using margaery to get to lord tyrell i think she knows that tyrell will convict because of the fact that margaery could have also drunk the wine also the likelihood of her influencing her father in the trial is minimal given how dedicated to his position he is and as for oberyn who knows i think his hatred stemming from his sisters death is yet to be shown fully could be interesting "

"907" "Muppet_N2" 2014-05-05 " what are the chances of jon being a warg just not knowing yet a lot in the books dont worry no spoilers there are parts were jon dreams about being ghost and he adopts his feelings and point of view i remember a part where he tastes blood after ghost hunted a deer or something like that "
"908" "DiamondDag" 2014-05-05 " theyve touched on it a few times in the show notably in the first season when jon whines about the nights watch and tyrion has to remind him how relatively easy hes had it all his life but its the same with tyrion despite his dwarfism he still grew up as a son of the richest man in westeros theres a list of characters we root for because they overcome some kind of adversity but martin usually undercut that by confronting them with people who really were bottom of the pile "
"909" "Randomsausage" 2014-05-05 " is pacing issues some kind of code for dany better get her kit off again pronto anyhooi think we all overestimate littlefingers plotting skills if as part of said plot he was obliged to sink his pink torpedo into lysawho is clearly madder than a wet hen "
"910" "vascopereira" 2014-05-05 " some people may complain about the deviations from the book but i think those changes were well made and in quite a few cases added up to the richness of the characters cersei for example on the series becomes much more canny that she is on the books in quite a few of her actions in the books her spitefulness makes her commit the most stupid and careless actions although to be fair that can be equally valid because it shows that she can destroy through her carelessness and paranoia what tywin has carefully built i really enjoyed her scene with margaery they really convey quite well a mutual distrust buried in a veneer of civility careful not to let anything slip out that could lead to the others advantage i personally find margaerys pragmatism much more sympathetic than danys increasing messianic streak its been enjoyable as ever although i agree that lysas revelation was a bit anticlimactic "

"912" "vascopereira" 2014-05-05 " barristan is indeed no fool i think he is afraid with good reason that dany has potential for the same kind of madness that manifested itself in king aerys selmy seems to be trying to subtly point out that perhaps dany is executing the masters not for justice but for the enjoyment of revenge he seems to see the danger that danys claims to a moral high ground will be questionable as she mirrors the behaviour of the masters but under the justification of justice "
"913" "sydneysider28" 2014-05-05 " i think that it may be because the book only showed events from certain of the characters but not all points of view so some things were only learned about after they happened if that character experienced the event but other things were only told secondhand to people so there could be quite long jumps at times in different character arcs and other events were perhaps just assumedi quite like that they are fleshing out some of the characters journeys and beefing up the roles of others i think the tv show runners are starting to invent quite a lot of scenes which makes it more interesting for those whove read the books  doesnt mean this stuff couldnt have happened its just that none of the narrator characters was there to see it they are also obviously giving some of the more minor book characters who are tv show fan favourites more to do for example bron i also guess they may bring some things forward from the last 2 books "
"914" "randombloke" 2014-05-05 " im not so sure about that bran releases hodor the very second its safe to and chooses to explain to hodor that the others need rescuing rather than controlling him and releasing them himself assuming control of hodor was an emergency measure when there was no viable alternative and he only made him protect the person hed already been helping anyway had bran made hodor senselessly torture ser pounce then it would have been a different story "
"915" "Debsta81" 2014-05-05 " really enjoyed this episode whilst i was really worried about the north of the wall plot deviations from last week they were really well done and had me fist punching the air for the last 15 minutes the cynic in me cant help but think that this just padded out the narrative for 2 episodes and we havent really moved plot wise bran is still trying to get to the magic tree and castle black is still waiting for a wildling attack and where is stannis highlights for me  that look between tommen and margaery and then cersei literally cock blocking her son  that very fleeting glimpse of varys i have missed him so  lysa arryn and her psychotic love for littlefinger is just brilliant those screams will haunt me in my sleep  the hound calling bullshit on meryn trant being able to kill the first sword of braavos could this be a hint that syrio is still alive oberyn cannot get enough of this man on my screen more please  pod on the horse priceless  jojens i saw you die tonight was breathtakingly creepy  brans fighting spirit and hodors size are the most deadly combo in westeros  im not sure whose death i enjoyed more  locke rast or karl nice to kill off three nasty characters in one episode ive not felt that satisfied since poor joff kicked the bucket "
"916" "backfromtokyo" 2014-05-05 " i thought cersei saying everywhere in the world they hurt little girls was rather affecting too "
"917" "vascopereira" 2014-05-05 " i agree the choice was either to warg into hodor or to die by the hands of locke its purely survival i found very interesting the sense of pathos of hodor realizing what he done it becomes rich in pathos because of a sense of horror at his part but also he is unable to understand that what he was forced to do was responsible for brans survival no matter how terrible the action was "

"922" "vascopereira" 2014-05-05 " although i think that dany is not entirely driven by entitlement that doesnt mean that she is free from the feeling of selfentitlement i think that she is as driven by selfentitlement as the other characters its a mix of a sincere but naive wish to be viewed as a liberator coupled with selfentitlement she is someone who has been shielded from the darker aspects of her ancestors whom she views as liberators but who in reality were just conquerers who had the key to domination dragon power the legitimacy of targaeryan rule was based on conquer pure and simple and that is something that she is either incapable or unwilling to face up she seems to be a character who so far has been set up high but who might be going for a steady and painful decline "
"923" "backfromtokyo" 2014-05-05 " i dont mean that i didnt notice hed aged however up until now his legs were covered and the focus was on his face in this episode you saw how big his whole frame is now it really stood out "
"924" "karenc627" 2014-05-05 " i liked sansas quick thinking when lysa suggested littlefinger was attracted to her  no he says im a stupid girl who believes in fairytales which iirc he never said about her  but she had once actually said about herself so there was a hint in that outburst of sansa berating herself for once having been exactly that but now that she sees shes not even safe with family that naive girl is gone i think next up for her is to learn how she can consistently use everyones naive girl perception of her to her advantage like she instinctively did last night i read the books but i dont recall exactly where her character left off ive never had much of an opinion of sophie turners acting either way  in fairness shes had to spend the last few years playing too scared to move which by definition means shes not going to do much but last night when her character got to finally open up only to have to quickly figure out how to get the defenses back up again i thought she did a good job "
"925" "16ghostly" 2014-05-05 " i agree that theyve taken serious liberties with the timing consider locke  he cut off jaimes hand somewhere between riverrun and kings landing in the same episode in which the wildlings were ordered to climb over the wall locke then somehow got past moat cailin held by the greyjoys to arrive at the dreadfort in episode 2 of this season and was subsequently able to travel to castle black begin training as a new recruit then march 60 miles to crasters keep meanwhile the wildlings have been stuck east of castle black for the majority of that time i bet stuff like that drives george rr martin nuts however in looking this up i noticed that when mance sends the wildlings over the wall he tells them to wait for a signal fire before attacking castle blackand that was one big fire they just set at crasters keep "
"926" "backfromtokyo" 2014-05-05 " its also important to remember that hodor isnt just a friend hes a servant bran is essentially a good character but at the same time like most high born he has a strong sense of entitlement he does things to hodor because he can things that he wouldnt dream of doing to someone he really considered his equal one thing i like about the books is that martin never lets you forget how strictly hierarchical the society is "

"936" "sadsadzoo" 2014-05-05 " i phrased that incorrectly  what i meant was theyve used most of the major events from the third book and wont go onto the fourth until the next season in pacing terms they are struggling without posting spoilers i cant remember much else left to happen in a storm of swords besides the tyrion arc and the end chapter for each character they seem to be stretching the gap by making up long nights watch scenes and plenty of samey aryahound scenes "
"937" "candylilacs" 2014-05-05 " first of all just because littlefinger persuaded lysa to do the poisoning doesnt mean it wasnt for the benefit of cersei either i have a feeling that anyone littlefinger kills or crosses is done to benefit more than one person and with lysa being so borderline personality disorder isnt she a good wife for him secondly why tell robin anything about sansa hes obviously annoying and stupid and will tell someone at an inopportune moment as for the pacing i think its the show way of trying to keep bran in the story when in the book hes elsewhere and near no action in fact his pieces in the books will be a challenge on screen i do know that i watched a writers room with the two showrunners and they said they often ran short 45 minutes a season  which is why they did sexposition in the first season so perhaps pacing is a problem for them and they decided to slow it down thirdly why is cersei bringing up marriage to margaery is she attempting to be a good queen regent but will end up failing because shes too impulsive and petty or does she have some bad plan brewing and i think she has no intention of marrying loras i do hope they take us to dorne at some point with men and women so equal that its shocking to others in the kingdom it should make for an interesting picture "
"938" "Barninho" 2014-05-05 " jorah wasnt paid to stop dany from attacking he was paid to set her up so she could be murdered also those orders came from robert who was obsessed with targaryans and is now dead the lannisters have a bit too much on their plate to be thinking about the dragon woman at the moment i reckon hes loyal if for no other reason than hes blatantly into her also re the geography of the north regardless of the geography even if the wildlings are miles and miles away it seems a little bit daft to make a huge fire out of crasters keep and then just stand there warming your hands "

"957" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-05 " i dont really get why it is that people think that they are stalling in order to avoid catching up with the books i keep thinking that they are going to have a hard time getting to the end of the story without picking up the pace and they have already picked it up significantly there is still a lot of important plot stuff that has to happen to bring us to the end of the last book i would say at least a whole seasons worth and that is with cutting out a fair bit "

"967" "DiamondDag" 2014-05-05 " overall i thought that was a stronger episode than last week i certainly enjoyed it a lot more but i agree with your criticisms sarah theyre falling into the same trap as season 2 where they have to check back in with every story line constantly whether theres anything going on or not from a dramatic point of view i thought bran getting captured and the ensuing mayhem worked out better than i expect but it did feel like they were just giving brans group something to do for a few episodes although it did feed into jons increasingly important story i had hopes that jon would finally start being the character i knew this season and its certainly looking that way so far for me the characters and stories surrounding the nights watch are what i look forward to most at the moment and jon is a big part of that the skirmish and his fight with karl were great man they know how to do gruesome deaths on this show speaking of gruesome deaths that little subplot with locke got snuffed out pretty quick didnt it its just a shame that it seems like as jon improves dany gets worse i have no idea why theyve suddenly decided dany has to act like she has a stick up her arse at all times maybe they just have alternate seasons with those two sansa and littlefinger getting to the eyrie was interesting too despite the clunky revelation of lysas role in littlefingers plans lysa is still as unhinged as ever i hope we get to see behind the barriers that sansa has understandably had to keep up for such a long time now maybe oh and hodor "

"969" "Bluegoat" 2014-05-05 " i dont find the pacing bad at all i actually dont like it when things seem to move on from one event to the next  it seems unnatural we need time to get there i was very happy to see some different sides of oberyn  i was worried that they were going to end up making him into a pathetic lech i disagree that little happened brans decision not to call out to jon and danys decision to stay put are both events in the arya section we found out something about what keeps those two characters going and that arya still has the hound on her list surely all of these things will have plot impacts but they also are important from a character perspective  what kind of people are they becoming and what do they think is important the story isnt mainly plot driven  its equally character driven that isnt a pacing problem if people find that boring maybe they just prefer plot driven stories as far as the thenns  i expect they are waiting for the main body of the army  no point in attacking the south side of castle black without the northern assault being ready to go too an army that size mainly on foot with women and children is going to be very very slow but it would be normal for them to have scouts and elements to attack from the other direction in place that far ahead  if they didnt they might well not get them where they wanted at all it does seem slow from a tv perspective but it is actually pretty accurate i laughed at the wedding night scene with petyr no one can say that he is unwilling to do the dirty work himself when its required "

"984" "dsk84" 2014-05-05 " i do wonder if the lack of progression was part of a wider attempt not to not catch up to the books too quickly not that i minded too much i guess the arcs that were shown can be divided into two  north of the wall and the vale where there was some progression and the other scenes where there wasnt necessarily much going on but they were broadly good scenes with dany it was good that they addressed the vacuum that her liberation had left there were bound to be ramifications from her actions and while her attempting to fix those issues isnt as exciting as an invasion it is what youd expect from someone who wants to rule and attempt to be a just ruler rather than merely a conqueror yes she killed those wise masters but that was her attempting to hand down tough justice speaking of dany my sister ended up getting a cat and despite my attempts to get her to name it ser pounce she ended up naming it daenerys probably cause it is a female cat and we all know you cant have female knights for a second i did think brienne was beginning to act a bit nasty to poor pod who admittedly was quite incompetent but she did seem genuinely impressed at his efforts at the blackwater and as a result was willing to humour him and give him a chance poor sansa really cant catch a break from being rescued from a loveless marriage and potentially being tried for murder but you can argue that if little finger hadnt gone back then she wouldnt have needed to be rescued anyway to being stuck with a crazy aunt who thinks shes after her husband and finding out shes to marry her whack job younger cousin lysa is positively unhinged though tyrion doesnt seem that bad a prospect anymore even cersei for that matter she may be a thoroughly vile woman but she is still fairly balanced she actually seemed fairly well behaved for once though was quite pleasant to margaery who despite being warned not to call cersei sister did exactly that and called her mother too must have realised how far the power had shifted in favour of the tyrells the best scenes were north of the wall though the attempted rape scene was unpleasant but it was meant to be and the verbal tete a tete between jojen and karl was very well done i actually had chills when karl asked jojen if he had seen what he and his men would do to his sister only for him to turn it right around the whole hodor thing was predictable enough but you couldnt help but get excited seeing him use the brute force hes capable of and at the same time feel bad for him when he realised what he had done it was obvious that bran and jon wouldnt meet but doesnt mean it wasnt enjoyable either "
"985" "derekdj" 2014-05-05 " sarah touched on a point that fans of got have realized long ago that the show creators are coming very close to where george martin left off in the books the last book dance of dragons was very much a stalling effort it felt more like martins attempt at avoiding writing a finale to the series while the show runnings still have a bit of the books material to base the show on its starting to feel like theyre intentionally spinning the wheels on some of the story lines in hopes of buying time before they tackle the inevitable that of having to deal with dance of dragons which have very little to do with the arcs of the shows various story lines "
