"2" "JohnDear" 2011-05-16 " i think everyone on here at least as far as i understand it dinklage was the first actor cast and that fan sites had pretty much demanded him in the role "
"3" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-16 " only seen a few clips but am halfway through the book series tyrion most important character by far so why cast him so badly terrible from clips ive seen i glad you stipulated you hadnt watched in properly so far because that assessment is way off the mark i think everyone on here at least would agree hes consistently stealing the show "
"4" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-15 " sonnet22 your in a distinct minority with that one "
"5" "sonnet22" 2011-05-15 " only seen a few clips but am halfway through the book series tyrion most important character by far so why cast him so badly terrible from clips ive seen should have been big mick who played the white witchs dwarf in bbcs narnia series and had small part in episode of black books great actor "
"6" "JohnDear" 2011-05-13 " the articles do say somethings which might be regarded as spoilers though at least he confirms some things which dont necessarily need confirmation also why does he talk about syrio forel as a bravo and that hes teaching arya the bravos dance when its obvious forel is talking about a place braavos "
"7" "ElDerino" 2011-05-13 " just read the article  for me the point about tyrions exchange with theon is that he and robb are precisely the type to raise tyrions hackles young strong fit and the heirs to noble houses  in other words the precise opposite of the cripples bastards and broken things he has sympathy for for tyrion the opportunity to tweak someone like that using his own weapons of words and quick thinking is always very sweet "
"8" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-13 " sarahhughes i found the theon greyjoy refs a bit off kilter too  to me the scene felt more as though they needed to find an excuse for more theon exposure although some of the different aspects raised are interesting  and of course if flagged up theons status as a hostage despite the comfortable upbringing he is getting from the starks mind you any excuse for more tyriondinklage is always more than welcome later scenes between jaime and jory cassel outside the kings bedchamber also provided a bit of back story to theon and the greyjoys "
"9" "Werthead" 2011-05-13 " i think my description of true blood as trashy was miscontrued as a criticism and fair enough it usually is when that word is used i meant more that true blood very deliberately evokes a trashy or perhaps more accurately sleazy atmosphere even in its very title sequence and often plays things for shock value such as the headtwisting incident last year as entertainment it is often enjoyable but generally it lacks depth it doesnt really engage with the issues it skirts around such as the oppressed minority stuff mainly because it doesnt track as mentioned above since oppressed minorities arent by their nature usually killing people on a whim thrones ambition is to tackle the theme of power who wants it why do they want it and what happens when they get it or it is thrust upon them and they seem to have made a reasonable start though the books can engage with it more fully "
"10" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-13 " i would second smartymcflys post its a really good article and worth reading i dont agree with everything in particular the stuff about theon as i think its a little unfair of tyrion to call theon out when the decision was made for him when he was only a child admittedly its arguable that tyrion is trying to wake theon up and make him realise that the time for choosing sides rather than having them chosen for you is coming "
"11" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-12 " for anyone thats interested there is a really interesting article deconstructing the last episode cripples bastards and broken things  around the subject of bastards there arent any spoilers as such in it although it does lay out what has been discovered so far and may point out a few things that some viewers may not have grasped yet from the tv show httpwinterfellkeepcomsif104aspx "
"12" "spacegirlgail" 2011-05-12 " i thought this was a fantastic episode i am loving daenerys sp realising her power and understanding that her brother will never be a leader she is going to have to make her own life i am convinced that none of robert and cereis children are really roberts and that is why the discovery of roberts bastard is so important and worth killing john aryn over "
"13" "HN1C" 2011-05-12 " its ludicrous if you know its not true i was going to point this out to mr sunburst but arguing with someone who is intelligent and wilfully ignorant is more than i can handle today "
"14" "varsas" 2011-05-12 " additionally assuming the letters in the mathematical equation mentioned in the review of the 1st episode stand for characters weve met and im guessing who those are correctly and based on what we have seen so far the ned  cersei theory isnt any more ludicrous "
"15" "varsas" 2011-05-12 " by far the most hilarious theory about jon snows parentage is the one that claims that he is the son of ned and cersei ive read it on a message board somewhere and laughed for hours she kept giving ned awkward looks when she came to winterfell priceless as someone who hasnt read the books this theory makes perfect sense cersei does given ned a significant look upon her arrival and she refers to having lost a dark haired boy "
"16" "HN1C" 2011-05-12 " laugh all you want just dont type ive read a lot of your posts and you are falling over yourself to shoehorn in your exotv knowledge at every opportunity for gods sake man control yourself "
"17" "Sunburst" 2011-05-12 " in case you missed it 308 pm i wont laugh at crackpot theories any more i promise "
"18" "HN1C" 2011-05-12 " sunburst  just humour us ok "
"19" "Sunburst" 2011-05-12 " if you hear a theory and you as a person who has read the book dismisses it then yes that is a spoiler i dont understand why some people have trouble grasping that concept uhm could it be because a spoiler is a revelation of an important plot point and since nobody has revealed any important plot point in any of the four weekly threads so far in fact nobody has revealed any plot point at all  then nothing has been spoiled i agree its not necessary to laugh at crackpot theories but seriously this is a couple of steps away from me posting someone on a message board somewhere thinks cersei is actually viserys in drag  what a silly notion and then people saying how can you post such a spoiler its a theoretical possibility and by laughing at it you have now effectively ruled it out and ruined so much i wont laugh at crackpot theories any more i promise but some of you guys could also lay off with the hyperoversensitivity jokingly discrediting a totally ludicrous and nonexistent plot point that nobody on these threads over the past four weeks ever mentioned because its ludicrous among dozens of real plot points nobody spoiled and dozens of sane theories nobody confirmed or rejected will not ruin anyones pleasure of the show "
"20" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-12 " cornerswell excellent descriptions in particular man on horse who just explains stuff which made me spit out my coffee poor iain glen i like his explanations my husband finds them extremely useful given that hes also incredibly confused and last night was driven to try and explain the relationships by making a strange political parallel involving democrats republicans and donald trump dont ask it made little to no sense now as to the whole spoilers v non spoilers thing  i know this is really hard hell when im writing the blogs i find it really hard as i occasionally think oh i could write that and then remember that people wouldnt know if it they are new to the series and yes there are theories and interpretations that would be great to discuss with book knowledge but there are also tons of sites out there to do that this blog for better or worse is on the tv site of the guardian and is dealing with the tv show so the discussion should be limited to the show in question and not the source material although that said i dont really think that saying theres an element of magic is a spoilers  in the first four episodes people have referenced magic even if only to dismiss it it might not exist now but its clearly existed in the past which means its reasonable to speculate that one day it might exist again "
"21" "HN1C" 2011-05-12 " sunburst  if you hear a therory and you as a person who has read the book dismisses it then yes that is a spoiler i dont understand why some people have trouble grasping that concept if you cant grasp it and it confuses you best to just totally shut up and avoid pissing people off or you could just restrict your comments to the tv show "
"22" "cornerswell" 2011-05-12 " i am really enjoying the series but im finding that if you havent read the books its virtually impossible to remember all the weird  wonderful names making it very difficult to discuss so in our house weve resorted to using the following evil blondie incest couple fat king horse people man on horse who just explains stuff blondie on horse who keeps losing her clothes sean bean and sean beans wifedaughterbastard son etc its exhausting and every week there are more but ive looked up how to spell tyrion lannister just to say that hes the best thing in it by far steals the show every week "
"23" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-12 " sunburst dont particularly want to get embroiled in a discussion on this  but in one of your comments you effectively ruled out a particular theory  that to my mind is a spoiler not a major one but viewers should be left to their own devices in deciphering the plots doesnt bother me ive read the books met some of the cast and crew discussed the plot at length with other fans at meet ups etc but this blog is read by those new to the show "
"24" "Sunburst" 2011-05-12 " oh come on spoiler by stealth honestly now so any time someone on another website makes a completely random silly theory that makes no sense to 999 of viewers in fact so silly that nobody had mentioned it here in the four weeks since the show went on air and somebody says oh thats silly  thats supposed to be a spoiler i agree its not necessary for me to report every silly thing i read somewhere and find funny and i wont but really this terror of nonexistent nonspoilers is a bit daft someone above was accused of spoiling because heshe said that there was an element of magic to this fantasy tv show seriously people chill out not a single thing was spoiled in this entire thread "
"25" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-12 " sunburst can i politely request that you stop with the spoilers by stealth book readers of which i am one have a responsibility not to give anything away here even if it is in mocking others theories  it effectively confirms  rejects theories that are being put forward here "
"26" "Sunburst" 2011-05-12 " also tinyfemalewriter no reason to be so upset regarding the mention of magic weve seen it in the first scene of the first episode dead people rising huge creature white walker with ghostly blue eyes surely that counts as magicalparanormalsupernatural also the creepy nanny mentioning pale spiders big as hounds viserys telling us that dragons once existed and the fact that the current summer is ten years long and that there was a winter that lasted a generation its obviously a world spiced up with a little bit of magic dont you agree so nothing has been spoiled "
"27" "Sunburst" 2011-05-12 " by far the most hilarious theory about jon snows parentage is the one that claims that he is the son of ned and cersei ive read it on a message board somewhere and laughed for hours she kept giving ned awkward looks when she came to winterfell priceless "
"28" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-11 " drquinzel great call on carnivale i thought i was the only person who liked that show also great call on the drinking game i might have to institute an unlikely brit spot of the week bella79 and elc153  im always torn about the one true heir as a plot on one hand its a cliche and martin doesnt like them as weve seen so far so it would sort of annoy me if that turned out to be the case on the other i like jon and kit harrington is really selling the character so part of me wants it to be true even though it is a cliche "
"29" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-11 " bella79 and elc153 im rooting for the one true heir theory for jon though if it is i reckon it wouldnt be revealed until about book 6 theres just something about the character  no disrespect to george martin meant but the troubled young bastard who strikes out on his own nearly always ends up being the one true heir or something equally important there would be a beautiful irony in that after all the crap hes taken for being neds bastard the sister angle could well be a good one "

"32" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-05-11 " greenstrings i guess it depends on which way you look at it reading books first wrecks watching it on tv watching tv first wrecks book reading experience although as this is a tv show blog i guess tv trumps books sarahhughes i would agree with the comparisons to deadwood  which was also a genre bending show  with complex characters and power struggles where i think deadwood currently exceeds got is in the context of the setting deadwood was able to be played tightly as it took place in such a restricted location that claustraphobia really helped to rack up the tension on genres more widely  i would place true blood as emosoaphorror it doesnt really play on the horror too much  it is never really frightening and also overplays some of the soap elements true blood hit the screens at just the right time to ride the twilight  emo  vampire fetish tidal wave which explains its huge popularity "
"33" "HN1C" 2011-05-11 " the drill seargent guy  looks like they have taken some minor charachter from corrie thrown him down a well for 6 months and given him nothing but crystal meth to live on the results are intriguing "
"34" "DrQuinzel" 2011-05-11 " ah how quickly people forget game of thrones and true blood arent the only hbo fantasy shows  they did carnivale a few years back a brilliant clash of good and evil although you rarely know which is which set during the american depression its not very comparable to either got or tb but it is one of the best tv programmes ive ever seen with incidentally another scene stealing dwarf in it im thoroughly enjoying got so far it just reeks of quality i agree that the dothraki scenes are probably the least engaging so far but harry lloyd always makes them worthwhile as the hissyfitting viserys i find tyrion and ned are the characters i keep wanting to return to surely some sort of drinking game can be created out of spot the unlikely brit so far my favourites are hollyoaks bird and chris from skins i was thrilled to see joe dempsie pop up though  i always thought he was the best actor in a strong skins year one cast and had been unfairly overlooked by british tv and now hes on hbo well done him "
"35" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-11 " on another note one of the best moments in this weeks episode i thought was the scene at the start of the joust where robert is drinking and looking grumpy as hell then announces they need to start before he pisses himself the oh god not again look on the queens face was priceless "
"36" "UninventiveName" 2011-05-11 " neither here nor there really but in case youre interested wikipedia for what its worth defines true bloods genre as supernatural or horror apparently being disctinct genres from fantasy "
"37" "UninventiveName" 2011-05-11 " ive got to agree that there isnt much point comparing game of thrones to true blood clearly they are in the same genre but thats only because fantasy is a ridiculously broad genre i wouldnt really compare tolkien to pratchett for example i agree that the deadwood comparison is fitting  everyone with their own agenda different factions at odds with each other and no character you can wholly trust genre is a useful way of pigeonholing a programme but if youre comparing themes and intent then its not necessarily that useful as someone said above i wouldnt use the bill as a reference point to discuss the wire i think its also arguable that true blood is as much soap as it is fantasy as a side point i also think the god hates fangs etc in true blood is very throwaway and its not a metaphor thats really explored in any meaningful way by the programme beyond the first 2 or 3 episodes of the first season not that true bloods lack of seriousness is a flaw its a good show anyway i have enjoyed game of thrones a lot so far although i have to say that the last episode while enjoyable was very heavy on backstory and a bit clunky at times hopefully from episode 5 or 6 onwards they will have got all the expositional heavylifting out the way and can concentrate on the story for the rest of this season and seasons to follow also cant wait for what must surely be the inevitable hatching of the dragon eggs they cant tease us for this long about them long shots of the eggs stories about dragons and how none exist any longer without some sort of pay off "
"38" "MoreTears" 2011-05-11 " sarahhughes well i certainly dont want to say you cant ever compare one drama with another drama of a different genre i suppose it is true that i usually see comparisons begin within a given genre and only later expand outside of it for example when boardwalk empire started people compared it to the sopranos organized crime when the pacific aired people compared it the band of brothers world war ii i was just surprised that the first thing i saw got compared with was boardwalk empire when i was expecting people to think of it in relation to true blood even if their thoughts were that it is much different than that other hbo fantasy series in a number of ways "
"39" "TinyFemaleWriter" 2011-05-11 " albinodirewolfdo not not not tell us what is in the books dont you think it would have been more interesting for us to discover there is magic by seeing it rather than having you blurt it out same goes for homosexuality or anything else that hasnt surfaced yet in the series "
"40" "MoreTears" 2011-05-11 " hn1c shows are classified by genre not tone i am sorry if you think that is silly but it is the convention and not one that i am going to quarrel with "
"41" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-11 " moretears i think youre right to point out that people seem unnecessarily sniffy about certain genres and even sub sections within that genre but i still dont completely buy the argument that you should only compare game of thrones to true blood because they are both fantasy as i mentioned above i think the hbo show it is closest to is actually deadwood subversionreinvention of an occasionally dismissed genre struggle for control generally populated with horrible people who are trying to do each other down set in place where largely horrible things happen and i do think its possible to argue that boardwalk empire does have a similar obsession with power and control although there are obvious differences i dont think the comparisons are being made because its the last flagship show but rather because most hbo shows are obsessed with similar themes underneath their trappings greenstrings i feel this blog should carry a warning step away from the books until the tv show is done redwinter thank you and great call about the themes of this week i really enjoyed the post that last scene was great  its interesting to see where loyalties will fall next week i cant imagine that robert will be pleased with catelyns actions somehow "
"42" "HN1C" 2011-05-11 " completely disagree with more tears tb and got are totally different in tone style almost every aspect the only thing that they are similar in is the as you say extremley broad umbrella of fantasy the actual subject matter is far less imprtant as how said subject is portrayed i dont think anyone is being sniffy towards the genre or subgenre just acknowleging that got is far more complex than tb i dont think tb aspires to be as serious as got at all its like comparing the bill to shadown line  both cop dramas but in reality a much better comparison for shadown line would be state of play  different genre but still much more similar thats the problem with genreheads its all about the genre "
"43" "MoreTears" 2011-05-11 " thefatcaptain comparing got and tb and noting the differences in tone is perfectly fine the process of comparing is not meant to yield the conclusion that two things are the same this whole discussion began with me saying it makes more sense to compare the new hbo drama with another hbo drama in the same broad genre fantasy  if one wants to make comparisons at all rather than immediately making comparisons with boardwalk empire the subject matter of which is just so far removed from that of got in my opinion frankly i think boardwalk empire came up in this thread because of how recently it aired on sky atlantic and now got has taken over as sky atlantics flagship show and about the whole vampireshomosexuals thing in tb surely the metaphor isnt gays are like vampires as much as normal society treats gays like monsters or if it is a bit much to say normal society at least the southern us society in which true blood takes place i believe gay sex is still on the books as a criminal act in most of the southeastern us "
"44" "TheFatCaptain" 2011-05-11 " surely the reason why true blood and got arent comparable is the tone true blood doesnt take itself very seriously at all whereas got clearly does neither being bad things in my book you acknowledge the metaphor in true blood of nonhuman species  minorities in our own society and discrimination against them god hates fangsgod hates fagsgays and that alone probably raises tb over got by certain standards of seriousness that metaphor is there but its pretty forced and not to be taken as a major point of the show in my opinion the vast majority of vamps that we are shown in true blood are powerful cold blooded killers and even the ones who are nice tend to kill too and hardly provoke sympathy for a suppressed minority if most gay people effectively had super powers and went around slaughtering straights as a matter of course i think even the most ardent leftie would struggle to campaign for them anyway thanks to those who mentioned the hbo and wiki guides  i still need to work out who a few of the names are "
"45" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-11 " sarahhughes good point although i suppose the fact that hes his blood doesnt necessarily mean he is neds son per se could be neds dead brothers or fathers boy i accept this could be clutching at conspiratorial straws but still its fun "
"46" "greenstrings" 2011-05-11 " well ive ruined it read the first two and i really wish i hadnt "
"47" "MoreTears" 2011-05-11 " albinodirewolf you misunderstand i said most people think the entire genre of fantasy is trashy but i am not one of those people i love fantasy i made the comment i did to werthead just to note that the kind of fantasy he or she likes would be just as easily dismissed as trashy by most people as the type of fantasy he or she was disparaging what i am really objecting to is fans of one kind  or subgenre  of fantasy taking a sniffy attitude to other areas of the genre i see that attitude on display quite a bit there are people who like vampire material who knock quasimedieval sword  sandals fantasy material as childish and i say they too are wrong "
"48" "AlbinoDirewolf" 2011-05-11 " moretears i do not understand how you think that the fantasy genre is generally trashy most books that have been written are trash as they were unimaginative and basically a ripoff of lord of the rings i would however like to point out that a song of ice and fire is well written it is very different from lord of the rings and even though this is a fantasy series the scenes with magic are few and far between the series is also extremely serious at times the series is depressingly serious another point id like to make on this is that this series does broach those topics that you claimed true blood had over game of thrones at the beginning daenerys was terrified of the dothraki but she learned that they were not very different from any other men and that things are rarely as they appear it broaches the topic of disability in a corrupt medieval setting and there are homosexual characters in the series it also broaches the social and political stigma of bastards cowards eunuchs and women "
"49" "MoreTears" 2011-05-11 " werthead true blood and game of thrones are the only two fantasy shows hbo has done and i am not sure one needs more of a reason than that to compare them as for your distinguishing got from tb on the grounds that tb is meant to be trashy and entertaining and little more i got quite a laugh out of that the entire genre of fantasy is trashy to most people and got certainly isnt lacking in sex even incest nudity and graphic violence the struggle for power ambition intrigue conspiracy  theyre in both shows you acknowledge the metaphor in true blood of nonhuman species  minorities in our own society and discrimination against them god hates fangsgod hates fagsgays and that alone probably raises tb over got by certain standards of seriousness "

"51" "Werthead" 2011-05-11 " i understand the temptation to compare one hbo drama with another but boardwalk empire i would think that the obvious comparison for game of thrones would be with hbos other fantasy drama true blood not hbos crimeintheussprohibitionera show im not sure why true blood makes some nods at other themes such as a minority trying to fight for equality but generally speaking its meant to be trashy and entertaining and little more thrones on the other hand is more about power authority responsibility and ambition in that sense its more akin to the wire though the wire was also more about hierarchy and the system which has some crossover with thrones ideas though you could also draw some comparisons to bwe the sopranos and rome "

"53" "redwinter" 2011-05-10 " sarahhughes another super blog  really enjoying it thanks and ill get my shallow disappointment at the lack of jason momoa nudity out of the way at the outset but i appreciate you keeping tally d the overriding themes for me this week in another episode i enjoyed immensely were chivalry and strength  and their relative importance in this world im really enjoying the exposition of the dothraki way of life and culture in the first episode we very much saw them through daenerys eyes  unfamiliar savage other but thats now developing they depend on horses and dont just respect them  they revere them they have an attitude to women that is the same in some ways as the more civilised peoples but also accepts women with power choice and control daenerys may have been sold in exchange for an army but shes no chattel now ha viserys suck on that they have a very distinct culture superstitions a mythology and an independence that has allowed them to thrive and avoid falling under the control of other kingdoms they may not be big on traditional chivalry but they certainly respect strength which brings me to kings landing where the hapless sir hugh benefitted from unearned favour which brings him title but ultimately a marvellously bloody end i agree with siriamis that this was fabulously well realised its people like him knights who havent earned the honour who earn the scorn of eddard hes a one for chivalry and strength  a man of his word straightforward in a world of doubledealing and im already fearing that his strength will not be enough to protect him the king we are led to believe once had both strength and honour  but now has neither jaime has lost his honour in the eyes of others and i reckon in the mirror too and then we have tyrion who has had to form his own code  and lives by it without fear or favour i agree that i cant see him being involved in the attempt on brans life i could go on but suffice to say i am entranced "
"54" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-10 " pillowhead and bella79  good arguments i think the key sentence is probably the one that ned says to jon in episode two when they say goodbye you are of my blood rather than you are my son it could just be old fashioned stark speak of course but it certainly suggests that jons parentage isnt straightforward hn1c  rent or download the station agent dinklage is absolutely fantastic in it actually the original pilot of game of thrones was shot by tom mccarthy who directed the station agent but they reshot for some reason with tim van patten helming instead moretears i think the boardwalk comparisons are reasonable if only because both shows are dealing with a scrabble for power and the politics of control as is true blood mind you a lot of the time game of thrones really reminds me of deadwood if were talking hbo shows just the subverting of the genre and the whole nobody should be trusted vibe "

"61" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-10 " bella79 one think that struck me what with the inclusion of both king roberts bastard son and the discussion of theon being a wardprisoner is that i am now convinced that jon snow isnt actually ned starks son he is obviously going to be a pivotal character in later seriesbooks i havent read them but something makes me think that both his parents are going to turn out to be very important characters and ned thought it was safer to claim the baby was his and try to protect him that didnt occur to me at all but now you say it makes a lot of sense would explain why ned is so guarded about his mother although the conversation he had with robert in the field in the previous episode does seem to contradict that idea regarding the whole boardwalk thing i watched all of that and it was ok but i gotta say got has got me far more enthralled and intrigued then boardwalk ever did "
"62" "MoreTears" 2011-05-10 " i understand the temptation to compare one hbo drama with another but boardwalk empire i would think that the obvious comparison for game of thrones would be with hbos other fantasy drama true blood not hbos crimeintheussprohibitionera show "
"63" "wellyeahokbut" 2011-05-10 " im not quite loving it yet but still hoping itll really hit its stride any minute now as a bookie ill stick with it whatever and my girlfriend a nonreader is hooked so its all good really cant speak highly enough of peter dinklage though great example this week is the moment hes accused by catelyn he doesnt protest doesnt seem shocked doesnt laugh it off or get angry he calculates he knows his guilt or innocence is irrelevant all that matters is how the big men with swords in the room will respond perfect "
"64" "Werthead" 2011-05-10 " oh btw when they were saying vario is a eunuch who is vario and the person who blond hunk is supposed to have killed he was the kings previous right hand man yes was he related to anyone sorry for the stupid questions sometimes its the really obvious things that pass me by as someone else said varys the eunuch is the guy on the council the fat bald man who also gave littlefinger the information that cat was on her way to kings landing the person blond hunk jaime lannister is supposed to have killed was the previous king the one before king robert the kings previous hand whose death sean bean is currently investigating was jon arryn who apparently died from natural causes but might have been poison i agree this stuff is confusing it helps in the book that you have a family tree you can flip to to work out whats going on "

"66" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-10 " idgnosis i agree with you about sophie turner as mentioned shes playing a difficult role and i think gets better with each episode hnic  good post im interested with the comparisons with boardwalk i loved the first few episodes of boardwalk but then i missed one and i felt no real compulsion to catch up instantly although ill watch it all on dvd ahead of season two but in contrast even if i wasnt blogging game of thrones i know i wouldnt miss an episode its got quite a grip werthead the us ratings have been pretty strong there was an interesting piece in the new york obsever i think about how theyre increasing week by week hellcat thank you  it was driving me insane where i knew him from yes yes i should have looked it up "
"67" "Werthead" 2011-05-10 " this episode definitely helped fill in some of the backstory but i am already starting to lose track of names maybe the hbo web site has a cheat sheet there is also the game of thrones wiki which is only updated as each episode airs which may be of use i thought he resembled samwise gamgee a little well more than a little grrm has said thats a deliberate nod to tolkien i think pyp for another nights watch member the thin darkhaired one might be as well but samwell tarly is a rather different character who has a somewhat different story arc most notably in lotr sam gamgee isnt a coward and has no problem mixing it up when necessary even early on in the books there are lots of little nods to other fantasy writers and series everything from roger zelazny and jack vance to robert jordan and tad williams including characters named after them mentions of legends that sound vaguely familiar and so on itll be interesting to see how many of these are also included in the series "

"70" "HN1C" 2011-05-10 " i think this works much better than boardwalkthe charachters seem to have depth even though lots are only seem briefly it seems that they are all taking it very seriouslyplaying a fantasy romp quite straight and it works only 4 episodes in but loads has happened already quite complicated to follow who is who etc but i like that in a show not deliberately complicated just naturally so boardwalk had loads of introset up scenescharachtersthis just flows along with little snippets of people coming in thje programme already has at least 67 charachters i would say im really interested ineven the little tomboy princess is really interesting peter dinky dinklage is always worth watching dodgy accent and all id describe the sow as braveheart  the morning after really was gripped by the last 2 episodes in a very surprising way esp since generally im not keen on sean see wot u can do bean but hes a good steady centre oh btw when they were saying vario is a eunuch who is vario and the person who blond hunk is supposed to have killed he was the kings previous right hand man yes was he related to anyone sorry for the stupid questions sometimes its the really obvious things that pass me by "

"75" "shexmus" 2011-05-10 " quite watchable it would be great to watch on dvd definitely because it is so cinematic certain tv shows are best served in double episodes and this is  even the wire suffered from hourly format simply because it wasnt as suitable for it as the sopranos as for game of thrones iy is like lord of the rings but with events moving slowly so far and with no big battle scenes and no orcs yet imho it is still trailing rome in historical drama category also lemme guess that handsome young man who joined the neighbourhood watch squad will end up in love with that pretty pregnant platinum blonde nubile later on in the series samwell tarly i thought he resembled samwise gamgee a little well more than a little "
"76" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-10 "  ozviking yeah exactly the same here particularly after last weeks scene where she goes on about him being a lannister not read the books either so quite enjoying having a wild stab in the dark after each episode "
"77" "Bella79" 2011-05-10 " a great episode as much as i like the fact that we now get us shows a day or two after they air in the states i almost wish we didnt so i could watch all ten episodes in one go its still a bit piecemeal sometimes jumping between plots and sometimes when one story is working so well  for me this week the wall  i resent the change to a new story and almost wish we could spend the better part of an episode with just one story not that thats realistic of course but this week i could have spent an hour at the wall and have been happy cant wait for them to finally go over one think that struck me what with the inclusion of both king roberts bastard son and the discussion of theon being a wardprisoner is that i am now convinced that jon snow isnt actually ned starks son he is obviously going to be a pivotal character in later seriesbooks i havent read them but something makes me think that both his parents are going to turn out to be very important characters and ned thought it was safer to claim the baby was his and try to protect him "
"78" "Werthead" 2011-05-10 " biggest misstep of the week was giving littlefinger sandors story in the book he tells sansa himself resulting in one of the most memorable scenes in the book if not the series having littlefinger tell sansa about it and not even giving sandor any lines at all is a very odd decision im not sure how that improves the narrative mccann is a terrific actor his turn as the disabled booklover in the book club was superb and could have done great stuff with that material but at the moment he is kind of forgettable excellent news ratings info for episode 2 shows that it got 165 overall on sky a modest drop from the 18 of episode 1 in particular it shows a lot of people are watching the repeats and sky online given that the overnight ratings dropped about 30 between the first two episodes even better news episode 3s overnights saw a 20 improvment over ep 2 putting it up to 628000 itll be very interesting to see what that does to the totals next week no news on the american ratings yet "
"79" "avidfan" 2011-05-10 " have to reiterate one of the previous poster’s comments that the show sometimes ‘understates’ putting it kindly the epic nature of many elements the dothraki horde is the most guilty element with the thousands of horsemen replaced with what looks like closer to a gang of 100 or so people i was anticipating they’d at least do a few cgi shots showing the numbers trailing off to the horizon this is mirrored by the scaled down elements over in westeros where the whole land just seems on a smaller scales – villages replace towns towns replace great cities etc maybe if the firsts season is a universal success they’ll ramp things up to what is deserved "
"80" "Ozviking" 2011-05-10 " pillowhead  ive assumed almost from the start that joffrey is the queen and her brothers son eww the king having dark hair and them both being blonds gives a quite large clue there ive not read the books so i could be completely wrong here "
"81" "Idgnosis" 2011-05-10 " this was actually my favourite episode so far it felt a little less rushed and i felt i had time to breathe and get to know the characters brans dream sequence was very cleverly done for all kinds of reasons i wont go into i loved the way it fooled the viewer in the same way that when dreaming you can fool yourself i also think that actress playing sansa has been a lot better than given credit for and she started to show that "
"82" "hendero67" 2011-05-10 " i hope samwise gamgees i mean samwell tarlee isnt going to go all private pyle on us really liked the scene with ned and the queen saying how they were each trained to kill their enemies glare double glare back at ya "
"83" "SterlingArcher" 2011-05-10 " my favourite episode so far despite a couple of clunky exposition scenes considering half the episode was exposition it was surprisingly gripping maybe this was because more than the previous episodes this one had a strong theme running through it  of people who dont fit in to their place in society from arya hating the idea of marrying a lord to sam being banished to the wall good stuff "
"84" "Pillowhead" 2011-05-10 " another good episode in terms of the knife issue the impression i got was not that littlefinger was lying but probably tyrion either lost it in another wager or gave it away possibly to one of his siblings it is pretty clear littlefinger is playing the long con though but to what end i have no idea all the stuff about roberts bastard son was very interesting and has got me thinking more about the discussion last week about wheter joffrey is in fact his son wild speculative theory alert ok so for me the lannisters clearly want to take the throne for themselves i would suggest they are going remove robert somehow and install joffrey as king i would imagine the starks wont be too hot on that especially as they know they killed arryn who was possibly trying to uncover theat joffrey was in fact not roberts son and as such not the true heir to the throne so maybe some kind of war is coming this then tied in with what dany was saying about her brother never reclaiming the seven kingdoms but wanting to go home so how about teaming up with the starks against the lannisters and cutting some kind of deal to give them kings landing the dothraki water issue is a problem but im sure there is some kind of omen that could cancel this out all the stuff at the wall was really good cant wait for winter and for jon and co to get the otherside of the wall also i really like the conversation jaime had with neds mate clearly a man who likes a good battle also the joust was good and of course peter dinklage as always was exquisite "
"85" "Siriamis" 2011-05-10 " the bathroom scene was officially the most cringeworthy sex scene ever but kudos to harry lloyd for playing such a convincing headcase  managing to recite ridiculous lines about dragon skulls whilst pretending to have sex and also making you scared he might turn on hollyoaks bird and smack her in the chops was no mean feat he reminded me somewhat of a skinny blond trevor from eastenders the stuff about the dragon skulls and the targaryen backstory is quite important though and i felt the way they told it from viscerys point of view reminiscing about his father etc gave his character another angle that you dont really get in the book sorry loved the jousting  nice to see a proper gruesome death instead of the sanitised falling off a horse and not moving you normally get in tvfilm jousting notable for the stark girls seeing their first death too  were not in winterfell anymore toto "
"86" "TAFKAJamie" 2011-05-10 " ukboy the hbo website does have a nonspoilery cheat sheet and some maps which might be helpful in orienting yourself in westeros and essos as youre unfamiliar with the books id recommend you look there and pretty much nowhere else as youre liable to run into spoilers from overenthusiasticunderthinking book fans or outright trolls "

"94" "Malkatrinho" 2011-05-10 " after watching the first episode i went out and bought all the books released so far ive raced through them all in the last 2 weeks and am now stuck in limbo waiting for the next book to come out in july im also watching the tv series each week thinking either thats not in the book or thats not quite how i imagined it in my head samwell tarly was played by james corden and by the end of a feast for crows sansa was that scottish bird off of dr who i think ive slightly spoiled my asoiaf experience and wish id managed to resist reading it until after id seen the series must admit despite the hbo budget the dothraki scenes are particularly underwhelming  its hardly the golden horde as described in the book and you dont get a sense of the size and vitality of kings landing either the hands tourney looked more like a village fete decent cgi doesnt cost the earth these days couldnt they have put a little more oomph into it "
"95" "Werthead" 2011-05-09 " this episode felt a bit expositionheavy but at the same time it was probably necessary ive seen lots of people talking about the previous episodes going hang on whos that guy when talking about theon so addressing that here and establishing hes another guy with daddy issues was a good idea thus giving him and tyrion something in common that leads to an interesting sidepoint during the original casting process i thought keith allen would be a great shoein as balon greyjoy but now his son is playing theon i wonder if it would be too much of a gimmick to make that casting call for later on in the series so overall a solid episode but clunky id rate it equal with episode 2 as the weakest of the season for me so far though not bad as such i actually suspect nonbookreaders might enjoy this more for the information it gives out whilst those who already know about it might feel its more blatantly trying to get as much info as possible before things kick off bigtime and we lose the time for fiveminute foreplay discussions about dragon skulls all of that said the final scene an iconic moment in the books is played here to perfection as great a character as tyrion is as wonderful as dinklage is its also true that up until now hes judged every moment well hes read every situation right and said the right thing every time and due to that has gotten a little smug that smile being wiped right off his face is simply priceless and theres also a terrific little nod to the fans tyrion thinks so little of the freys that he laughs at them which riles the frey knight enough to join in the swords being drawn when otherwise such as in the book he would have stayed out of it owch own goal tyrion "

"99" "dotmegsam" 2011-05-09 " loving the series especially peter dinklage who simply acts the rest off the screen armed with the best lines and the most interesting character where danaerys and viserys are concerned im afraid that in our house every appearance is greeted by quotes from the holy grail let us not go there it is a silly place and will remain so until the world of dothraki requires more than a shrubbery and and a tent to establish and poor mr momoa actually gets some lines iain glen is fine but is basically basil exposition on a horse most looking forward to the trip beyond the wall  winter is coming cant come soon enough for me "
"100" "Lalwende" 2011-05-09 " not sure i agree with them giving the hounds backstory to littlefinger to tell in the book he tells it himself and this is more significant butalliser thorne won tonight for me he was a horrible man with an even more horrible tale to tell hodor "
