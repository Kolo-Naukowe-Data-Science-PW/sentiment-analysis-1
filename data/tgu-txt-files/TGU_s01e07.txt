"2" "JenJen2" 2011-06-04 " this was definitely one of the better episodes so far though not as great as last weeks roberts death scene was awesome he was definitely one of the few characters in the book i had uninterrupted sympathy for even though he was dull as a brick sandwich i continue to fall for samwell and im glad john bradley is playing him with the finer attributes from the later books you dont necessarily get to see in the first have to totally disagree with the initial evaluation of danys reaction to khal drogos certified 100 testosteronepumping manspeech from where i was sitting she only seemed to get more and more aroused as his promises of carnage unfolded a bit weird maybe but given that one of her servants is apparently turnedon by recitation of dragons names perhaps its only to be expected yes the fauxlesbiansex scene was a real low point and for me it almost soured me on the entire episode while im not especially prudish about sex scenes there was no real point to it baelishs exposition could have happened so many other ways i just felt this was naked sorry pandering and unnecessary dumbingdown also im still bitter that they cheated the female section of the audience out of a beansternudity scene in episode one "
"3" "EACLucifer" 2011-06-04 "  bealzabubba the south technically is dorne and we wont see a proper dornishman for quite some time wot no highgarden to the south of kings landing are the storm lands from which the baratheons hail further south is highgarden the citadel of the maesters and house tyrell including a certain knight of flowers then it is dorne we might get to see a dornishman quite soon if they bother showing aron santagar "
"4" "Rosimir" 2011-06-03 " bealzabubbai’m a “nonreader” and had not realised that there was some attempt to distinguish the groups by accent bran arya and sansa sound rp to me jory sounded northern even though the actor is scottish however as flippancy is in the air if the lannisters are western shouldn’t they speak with gert lush vicky pollard brizzle accents my “nonreader” view of characters changes constantly eg daenerys is a cipheris asserting herself in a good wayis possibly going to become a major monster if it transpires that petyr baelish is goodness personified i shan’t be at all surprised "
"5" "KarolusAfricanus" 2011-06-02 " just caught up with it too book reader from a few years back so its muddled enough that some of the details are only coming back as i watch the show and new to guardian forums too so you know it all  i wanted to comment on the case of petyr littlefinger baelish to me the scene where he explains his take on life and politics was just that exposition rather than heavyhanded script foreshadowing of him siding with the queen against the hand they could have stuck with the books storyline where you dont know whats going to happen but that only works because you only see the story through the eyes of some of the characters so all in all i dont think it detracted too much from the tension of the episodes final scene indeed my take on baelish siding with cersei in the throne room has been always that he might have sided with ned stark thinking he could play him and profit from his rule as lord protector of the realm had ned been willing to play the game but he found ned to be too passive and too reactive for his taste by trade littlefinger likes to plan things and stay a few moves ahead of his opponents so when he realised ned had turned down renlys offer he went and offered his services and the loyalty of the watch to cersei with renly and his followers gone petyr knew for a fact she had the better hand but maybe im wrong and he had planned it all along and played ned for a fool from the start by offering his help to turn the tables on cersei the knife thing i guess it could all boil down to littlefinger sowing trouble he hopes to benefit from ultimately by pitting starks and lannisters at each others throat  whatever degree of truth there is in the knife now being tyrions which is something i dont remember we ever really get to the bottom of however i am struck by comments saying catelyn should have investigated more closely and questioned tyrion and it certainly feels like a good point i dont remember how i felt at the time when i was reading all in all i think cat 1 is enraged by the attempt on bran when she was hospitable to the the lannisters and 2 falls victim to prejudice just as everyone else the imp is an evil man because of his difformity because he is a lannister they have a bit of a reputation and also because of his own personal ways as he plays his evil and decadent imp role to lure people into thinking they know who he is and she possibly trust littlefinger as her husbands informant why should she not believe the knife is tyrions so she does not question him because it simply cannot be anyone else anyway enough rambling ill now wait eagerly for the next installment of sarahs excellent blog if only it were not in another 5 days  "
"6" "pintooo" 2011-06-02 " eddielarkin  i stand corrected then thanks for putting me right dont want to give away any spoilers so wont comment further "
"7" "WalkerboyUK" 2011-06-02 " ive been playing catch up since about episode 3 so only got around to this weeks episode at 530 this morning dont ask excellent and probably the best one so farthings are ramping up nicely and it appears that all hell will let loose eventually regarding littlefingers turn i saw that coming from the moment he was introduced and i havent read the books hes a smarmy little git who has the look of someone who claims he can be trusted with every word but the moment he sees a better offer hell spill it all outas for the girlongirl yes gratuitious but at the same time it was there for a reason ros is a northern girl and evidently the way they do things up north is a little more rough and ready littlefinger was training them to ensure their customers get exactly what they want and are made to feel special that way he ensures his own income loved the look on danys face when drogo starting to talk about what he would do to the women and children  a total oh shit what have i done momentthat said she made a remarkable recovery from seeing her brothers head boiled by gold ast week "
"8" "candylilacs" 2011-06-02 " the direwolves in cgi worries me i think the problem is that the company may be using real wolves which need patience and dont deal with other humans very well read about when they used real wolves in eipsodes of true blood theyre great with hitting their mark but the trainers arent comfortable with a lot of human interaction i dont see why they just didnt use big huskiesmalamutes but to each his own that said brans wolf seems to be doing a fine job sansa and aryas didnt have much of a part if the eggs ever hatch im also afraid the cgi dragons will be incredibly disappointing "
"9" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-01 " cavalierdisregard thank you although to be fair its the sort of show it would be hard to really screw up writing about given how much is going on also i will now spend a ridiculous amount of time thinking about robert on a question of sport so thanks for that elderino  sophie turners acting has grown on me actually i think her mood swings are reasonably consistent with being a teenage girl and i quite like the fact that this sansa is a bit more stroppy than book sansa i also thought osha was good although yes we didnt learn that much more about theon  i think the key as i mentioned above is that we learnt that theon considers himself to be very different from the starks but osha truly is different she is genuinely free in thought whereas theon is merely posturing milliekate  i wasnt that convinced by the renly loras scene either it was wellwritten but again i thought it teetered on being a little ridiculous "
"10" "Milliekate" 2011-06-01 "  stopwhistlingthank you i was dimly aware of some of that but most of it got lost through a haze of embarrassmentsense of disbelief that i was watching that scene interestingly i was fine with the man on man action the week before perhaps that was because there was no crucial exposition going on anyway nuff said "
"11" "Bealzabubba" 2011-06-01 " numisi1981 sorry you find the question about accents boring – if i asked on a us centric board no one would know the answer i do concur that northmen don’t need a northern englishscottish accent – i just wanted to know if the producers spent the the timeeffort to make them consistent – as somebody who loves the books it’s important to me that they get the details down as well as possible – even if i can’t hear it while i quite like the plot it’s the abundance of details in the books frequently seeming to be throw away lines that make them so endearing to many readers stannis i don’t believe he’s been cast he is important to the overall saga but… you will not see on screen a host of characters that are also important to the tale this season of which stannis is but one the dagger the information is there maybe somebody here hass got it maybe not i will only take my muzzle off long enough to state that i didn’t figure it out during my first read through question for nonreadershave you changed your opinion about any of the characters since the start of the show that is is there anyone whom you loathed but now appreciatelike or the reverse "
"12" "DiamondDag" 2011-06-01 " this may be because ive not read the books but am i the only one who is not bothered that the direwolves arent in it much id rather have no wolves than some cheap cgi twilight wolves sorry to be blunt but you could only say that if you hadnt read the books i know a few people are irritated by us folks that have read the books and keep making comparisons and thats fair enough it kind of creates an us and them feeling which i dont want so sorry in advance in the books the direwolves are very much characters in their own right as much as animals can be i suppose in particular brans bond with summer i dont think they have even mentioned his name in the show and jons bond with ghost are incredibly strong ghost is pretty much jons only companion in his first few scary days at the wall instead most nonbook readers probably get the impression they are little more than set dressing i totally understand if the producers just felt real animals werent working thats just the way it goes its just such a shame and while it might seem like a small thing to others to me its probably been the biggest disappointment in a show that has done most things brilliantly "
"13" "Jonnytheshirt" 2011-06-01 " cracking stuffalthough im enjoying the humanisation of cersei in lena she seems much more a stoic mother defending her family however she can and you feel almost sorry for her shes lost some measure of zest however cersei was penned as one of the most beautiful women in the realms and not afraid to use it at all shame the botched seduction attempt of ned was dropped because thats a big bit of cerseis essence her manipulation of men "
"14" "mygrimmbrother" 2011-06-01 " hummdrumm i actually thought the scene in which brans wolf sorry dont know their names yet defended him and tore out the assassins throat was marvellous  especially the way it behaved immediately after jumping up on the bed and lying next to him licking its bloody chops and somehow managin to look really angelic good dog i also loved the scene in which arya forced hers to run away imo it would be a sad sad thing to replace these fine beasts with superfluid and utterly unreallooking cgi counterparts even if theyre much more manageable "
"15" "ElDerino" 2011-06-01 " agree with sarahhughes on arya and sansas accents  the accents they will have been brought up hearing most of will have been catelyns septa mordanes and any other ladiesinwaiting that cat brought north with her and numsi1981 i do believe that actors have the ability to put on different accents as necessary i think maisie williams and sophie turner are doing a great job as the stark girls and i don’t care that much but i’m interested in other people’s thoughts seeing as the question’s been raised maisie williams is doing a good job ive gone back and forth a bit on sophie turner but i think its probably more of an issue with the material she has to work with than her performance not only does sansa tend to be a bit onenote and a pretty unsympathetic note at that but she seemed to go from being hopelessly naive and lovestruck to having a much more disillusioned realisation of what it would like to be a queen in a loveless politicised marriage then straight back to hopelessly naive again like some of the others i wasnt keen on the brothel scene  it just brought up too many awkward questions as people have pointed out above how did ros get there so fast unless we assume everything we see happening in the north is several weeks behind what we see in the south given that littlefinger is master of coin and up to his neck in intrigue is he really going to be wasting time training prostitutes and given that he knows how extensive varys web of spies is why would he be so open about himself i also wasnt that keen on the theonosha scene  the stuff about theon just seemed a retread of what weve heard several times about him and im not sure about natalia tena as osha yet which is interesting given how grrm has talked about how they were blown away by her audition pretty much everything else in the episode was absolutely great though  tywins introduction roberts death scene the ending which still produced a knot of tension in my stomach even though i knew exactly what was going to happen and the dothraki scenes we finally got a feeling of vaes dothrak as a living city teeming with people rather than the rather scantily populated place wed seen so far "
"16" "macster" 2011-06-01 " the wolves couldve featured a lot more but you can see why the directors were disappointed with them  the doggies theyre using are a bit too cute and look only capable of licking their prey to death i guess theyll be cgid in the next season when theyre supposed to be a fair bit bigger "

"18" "stopwhistling" 2011-06-01 " milliekate he was doing a massive basil exposition while lazily perving on his new recruits his back story is that he grew up with neds wife and from an early age carried a torch for her she didnt reciprocate saw him as a harmless little brother she was intended to marry neds brother who died so she was matched with ned little finger realised that he couldnt compete with these men of breeding nobility and strength but had to adapt and become sneaky the conspiratorial weasel a man capable of skilled deception in essence the political equivalent of orgasm faking hos he was training up i had to watch the scene twice once with kleenex once without kidding sorry "
"19" "numsi1981" 2011-06-01 " i have to say that i find this discussion about accents pretty boring after all this is a show and the only thing it might want to achieve is some consistency in the accents of the same family members but how realistic is it that you can cast 10 actors from lets say yorkshire who could play the whole stark family by the way who says that the starks need a northern english accent and the baratheons a southern accent could be exactly the other way round and it would not make a difference at all i am just happy that the producers went for an english cast it just suits the atmosphere and setting of a fantasy drama much better than an all american cast funny thing the assassin sent to kill bran in his bed had the best accent ever youre not sposed to be here no one sposed to be here had that in my head for a couple of days i was really psyched to read that george martin seemed to have exactly that accent in mind when he wrote the book my quotation is literal "
"20" "Miguelgonzalez" 2011-06-01 " actually bran doesnt have an northern accent either only the older boys do jon and robb also if im not mistaken jory was scottish wasnt he "
"21" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-01 " vetrit7 i worked in manchester and knew plenty of posh northern girls who didnt sound northern at all so im going to give the stark girls the benefit of the doubt accent wise and say that as theyre ladies to be theyve been raised without the accents by their septa although as mentioned the accents or lack of them dont actually bother me at all "
"22" "MrMydak" 2011-06-01 " avidfan apologies but i cant tell you anything about next weeks episode yet most sorry for this regards mm "
"23" "numsi1981" 2011-06-01 " dandelionzalthough catelyn has some doubts about whether tyrion actually did which seem to be there in the show as well she never questions him about the incidence or lets him explain about the knife at the tavern she just saw the opportunity to seize tyrion and did it no questions asked "
"24" "HummDrumm" 2011-06-01 " some thoughts about season 2 1 direwolves i hope the comment about the producers being disappointed with the trained animals and moving to cgi for the next season is true as the direwolves are very underwhelming and they are hardly ever on the screen i thought ghost bringing the severed hand back was very weak hope he ups his game for next week 2 stannis have we seen stannis maybe they could cast mark addy as he is roberts brother that would be great "
"25" "Dandelionz" 2011-06-01 " true i was being overly flippant  but that in itself is part of the problem catelyn is being overly simple surely she should think the same thing and he after that hasnt offered explanation coercion or even tried to convince her that shes wrong it just seems a bit too simple for want of a better term "
"26" "JohnDear" 2011-06-01 " t just doesnt seem like him to simply go yeah thats my dagger you got me and then go along with it and be thrown in someones aeriegaol he doesnt he protests his innocence and at one point does say do really you think im stupid enough to arm an assassin with my own knife "
"27" "JohnDear" 2011-06-01 " youd kind of hope an assassin would have their own weapons i defintely sense littlefingers hand in it somewhere my immediate thought when littlefinger said oh yes thats my knife but i lost it was that he was desperately back pedalling having been found out and that he just picked tyrions name out of the air but i dont understand what his motivation might have been jaimecersei were the obvious suspects and jaime might be stupid enough to use a knife in the possession of his brother im really not sure what its pointing at "
"28" "Dandelionz" 2011-06-01 " excellent show not much point repeating everything that everyone else has already said but there is one thing ive not seen mentioned thats been heavily puzzling the mrs and myself non book readers though will likely get the first book after its done and read it then and then try and resist getting the next ones  catelyn comes across as a smart woman shes arrestedcaptured tirion out of family duty and honour but she then seems to have turned into a bit of a simpletonshe hasnt questioned tirion at all shes simply captured him said this is your knife right you did it and left it at thatmore to the point tirion hasnt bothered to come up with any of the subtle reasons and excuses and explanations that frankly are his best asset in every other situation weve seen him in i guess whats bothering us is that we all know who lobbed bran off the tower we all know the lannisters are schemers and tirion i seem to remember had deep suspicions about what actually happened right back in the second episode he certainly knew what his siblings were up to it just doesnt seem like him to simply go yeah thats my dagger you got me and then go along with it and be thrown in someones aeriegaol nor does it seem like catelyn to not actually investigate and just to assume i appreciate that the series may have glossed over some book details that make it all a lot clearer or more deeply thought out at least for brevity but it just seems a bit lacking there to meand most likely that deeper detail could be as simple as tirion knowing full well that his brother and sister did it and hes keeping quiet and taking the blame on their behalf we just seem to be lacking a bit of reason where that plot thread is concerned other than that no complaints  though more wolves would never hurt  "
"29" "Vestrit7" 2011-06-01 " and yes i am fully aware of my blatant hypocrisy in writing a long post about accents of all things and then taking the pss out of a comment about a budget deficit  "
"30" "Vestrit7" 2011-06-01 " just following up on the discussion about accents i agree that the northern males sound northern not so sure about the females – arya sansa and ros in particular we’ve heard seven women from the north speak catelyn – not actually northern she’s from the riverlands so that’s fine she wouldn’t sound northern old nan – sounds northern to me osha – sounds northern to me septa mordane – doesn’t sound northern but probably isn’t a northerner she’s a septa representing the seven which is a southern religion so she’s probably from the south originally sansa – born and raised in the north but doesn’t sound northern to me now i personally don’t know any posh northern women so i don’t know if it’s just that i can’t hear the accent arya – born and raised in the north but doesn’t sound northern to me ros – presumably northern but doesnt sound northern to me if she’s a whore near winterfell you assume she’s local and grew up poor so would have a strong northern accent any thoughts i think maisie williams and sophie turner are doing a great job as the stark girls and i don’t care that much but i’m interested in other people’s thoughts seeing as the question’s been raised something that i thought would have generated more discussion was the revelation in episode 3 that westeros has its own budget deficit problems yes with all this threat of war incest murder and attempted murder assassination attempts mad children and wee ones being thrown out of towers questions about dragon’s eggs horrific goldfingerstyle deaths betrayal political intrigue trials and rampant sex i also cant quite believe people arent discussing a budget deficit… p "

"32" "CavalierDisregard" 2011-06-01 " loving the show been reading this blog after every episode good work by the way sarah but first time posting johndear now heres a thing i dont understand when we meet littlefinger first he says the knife the assasin tried to kill bran and catelyn with was his but that he lost it to tyrion lannister thats why catelyn kidnapped tyrion now we know littlefinger is a bad guy and has been manipulating the starks did he actually send the assassin himself if so why and was he really stupid enough to arm the assassin with his own knife i thought it was pretty clear that jamie lannister sent the assassin to kill bran as him and cercei are the only ones with any sort of motive to do it its not unfeasible to think that jamie would have access to tyrions knife however after the comments from hoover2001 and bealzabubba about answering your question giving away spoilers i am less sure and also if you were going to hire someone to kill someone you wouldnt give them such a recognisible weapon youd kind of hope an assassin would have their own weapons i defintely sense littlefingers hand in it somewhere "
"33" "Joemanji" 2011-06-01 " i dont think the lesbo monologue from littlefinger spoiled his later betrayal at all rather it just further described his duplicitous nature he seemed to be playing all the angles and i was never sure which side he would eventually take i have no doubt he would have sided with ned had that been the better play i really had no clue what was going to happen when ned marched into the throne room but it was obviously not going to go well brilliant stuff "

"37" "kalobhr" 2011-06-01 " wonder if theyre going to do any with that eg a revelation that his death wasnt a natural one  murdered by jaime or by his own mother thats not a spoiler its genuine speculation the child wasnt featured in the book in the equivalent scene between ned and cercei where she confesses her incest in the book she does also say that the one time she carried roberts child he jaime insisted she got rid of it she also goes on to offer her sexual services to ned to try and win him over "

"62" "pintooo" 2011-05-31 " sorry about being a contrarian but although i love the series i didn’t like this episode the strongest scene was certainly khal drogo’s promise to dany and their unborn son i hate to be the bore that compares the show to the book but some of the changes were not for the better littlefinger’s betrayal was not so obvious in the book i think the sequence of events at the wall were different – jon took his vows and was informed after that that he was not to be a ranger once he couldn’t back out this was one episode which seemed hell bent on assigning “goody” and “baddie” status to the characters the books are more subtle than this and that was rather disappointing nonetheless i still love the series and look forward to more the most pointless scene was littlefinger’s exposition and backstory not needed and very gratuitously done i’ve no problem with sex scenes – i loved the two series of spartacus – but there should be a point to them what was it here a backdrop to his otherwise dull monologue and a small insight into his understanding of the need to play a role we were developing a picture of the latter we also got a hint that perhaps he has eyes for sansa as his creepiness also suggested in earlier episodes so he’s pretty icky got it but the shock factor was totally ruined my favourite characters are certainly cersei dany tyrion jon and arya i hope sansa develops into someone more substantial and yes – bring on the direwolves "

"64" "Melissa2807" 2011-05-31 " hi everyone first time posting but had to put my 2p in ive been really enjoying the series so far and have been thinking for a while now that ned is on very shaky ground i reckon they are going to do a lost and kill off one of the main characters ive said this since he became the hand but my oh is having none of it ive not read the books but am sorely tempted just to know if im right my only issue with this is that up to now the focus has been very much on ned  hes the loyal dependable one i dont feel that having not read the books i have got to know anyone else enough to care about them as a main protagonist to me the stark kids aparts from jon and hes stuck up on the wall are not particularly likeable arya is the most interesting because at least she seems to have a bit of backbone rather than just being stroppy and spoilt eg bran and sansa catelyn is similar  it was obvious that she was going to cause a world of pain for ned by going off and doing what she did  did she not think frustrating the scenes with the dothraki are interesting too i like the refreshing contrast between the openness of the dothraki and the politics in kings landing  but again i have an inkling all is not as it seems drogo is not going far in this  they dont give him enough lines dany is the key  i think she might kill him or hell get killed or shell leave or something and when are the bleddy dragon eggs going to hatch  now that one is obvious its only a matter of time "

"66" "numsi1981" 2011-05-31 " californiafan of course my comment lacks any proof of hbos motives to have so many nudity scenes in their shows and i agree that making money seems to be the strongest incentive that being said it is no coincidence that hbo shows are highly acclaimed by liberal viewers more so than by more conservative ones and my very personal feeling is that their producers often play with their liberal image which includes pointless sex scenes and strong violence in all of their shows to me it seems that they just defy intentional or not the double standards of the conservative american world just my opinion coming back to the littlefingerbrothel scene i guess the writers just wanted to make it more explicit that littlefinger is a narcissistic ass spoiled for life by the fight with brandon i agree that revealing his true plans with catelyn and eddard could have been more subtle on another point i see some similarity between the way littlefinger and theon are portrayed the show producers make it very clear that something is not right with these guys and there loyalties are not where they should be much more obvious than in the book so someone should tell robb to watch his back otherwise he will end up like his father with a blade at his throat "
"67" "spacegirlgail" 2011-05-31 " i loved this episode the drama is building immensely we have kahl drogo promising the 7 kingdoms to his unborn son jamie lannister coming back with 30000 of his fathers men lord stannis coming to claim his throne in response to neds message to say nothing of whatever is beyond the wall i will miss king robert immensely he really did play the part to perfection and finally i have got over my urge to smack ned in the face for being so damned naive he is frustrating at times but i have rationalised that in such a place with all the machination and political manoevuring he has taken a decision to do is what he thinks is right and let the chips fall as they may how am i going to wait a week for episode 8 "
"68" "DrQuinzel" 2011-05-31 " havent read the comments yet so apologies if im repeating anything im not one of the book readers so i didnt feel that littlefingers treacherybasic nature was too heavily foreshadowed i was still shocked at the end when he turned on ned perhaps those who have read the books thought it was too obvious merely because they knew it was coming for me him appearing with a knife at neds throat and a cartoonish grin on his face was brilliant although maybe i was just struggling to concentrate on his incriminating dialogue earlier on what with all the sex and my housemates clearly wondering what the hell i was watching nice to see some wall action i didnt realise that i missed it i laughed out loud when sam struggled to rise as a man the show is currently perfectly balancing all the courtly intrigue with the much greater threat coming from beyond the wall and god they really arent afraid of killing people off poor king robert the great mark addy he died as he lived like a pig "

"72" "numsi1981" 2011-05-31 " loved it of course as a recently started book reader but not further than the last episode i have to say that littlefinger screwing ned over was pretty obvious in both the show and the book if you are aware of most of the characters furtiveness than you should have seen it coming the only difference is when because with littlefingers scene in the brothel it became pretty clear that it must happen within this episode completely agree that the girlongirl sex scene was pretty gratuitous but as this is an hbo show we just have to accept it i guess after all hbo understands itself as a bastion of liberal america so it tries to rub nudity and brutality into the conservatives faces whenever possible  but dear producers if you have to put a pointless lesbian sex scene into an otherwise great show then please cast two hot chicks rather than only one momemt of the episode robert being completely selfdeprecating when saying killed by a pig people comment on neds stupidity however i would argue that he didnt have another choice than relying on littlefingers money they have indeed come to a very dangerous place where nobody is on the side of the kings hand maybe he should have gone with renly as the new king at least littlefinger had sworn loyalty to catelyn stupid would have been when he had agreed to keep his mouth shut and accept joffrey as the new king you cannot trust the lannisters on keeping their end of the peace why should he anyway they tried to murder his sun and killed half his house guard joffrey on the throne was hilarious that kid is so spoiled i hope the show ends in a fight between him and robert arryn cersei and lysa in their corners telling them how to fight man has a show ever created characters that we can loathe and some of course love more than in game of thrones what a pleasure to watch "
"73" "candylilacs" 2011-05-31 " they seem to use littlefinger to do a lot of exposition  remember he also did the backfill for the hound sandor clegane at the tournament and in the book its sandor telling his own story  actually i thought it more powerful that way but whatever    as for daenarys i would be a bit worried about her the people closest to her illyrio ser jorah and to a degree even drogo obviously see her as a means to an end id like to think shell be her own woman however i didnt like the last scene basically littlefinger spends 15 minutes with two naked girls telling his philosophy of life and how about he couldnt compete with men like ned because he wasnt strong like them and then in the very end scene he has ned by the throat with a knife perhaps they were making some kind of statement but it didnt ring true to me littlefinger would be at the side of the queen and smirking smarmily "
"74" "Bealzabubba" 2011-05-31 " as a smary book reader i truly loathed the borethel scene not becase i truly mindedthe two working girs but because it took away fom petys betrayal of ned in an earlier thread jorah mormont was referred to as nigel exposition on a horse ros is now simply ta exposition opportunity for the last two episodes weve had the pleasure of seeing momoa actually do something and hes carried it off well finally he is the barely civiilized horse lord we knew in the book through different methods mind you i didnt realy like the way jorahs test of conscience was handled he was more mysterious until quite a bit later and it worked in the books well but really its an adaptation not a truly faithful recreaction  and im fine with that within limits what really matters is it hooks the non readers as well watch regardless if only to complain ive been greatly enjoying your take on the seris from the us and its a bit different i love seeing the nonreaders speculation  theyre fun to see and some may be spot on or some may be spectacularly wrong try to keep em coming if you can but i have a question i think only someone in the uk can answer  are regional accents consistent that is are the nothmen consistently using one regional accent the westermen lannisters another and southrons a third et cetera osha sounded a bit different even to me but maybe its cause i want her to sound different "
"75" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-31 " californiafan i wonder about that actually it might have been an elk i am now exposing the fact that i er grew up in london and live in new york and um know next to nothing about different types of horned beasts i presumed it was a deer for the symbolism but im happy to be corrected gardien  absolutely which is why i said the scene was clever in its construct i just personally think they overplayed their hand with it and in doing so lessened the power of the final scene "
"76" "Gardien" 2011-05-31 " the whole point of the early girlongirl stuff is that littlefinger was teaching the girls how to fool the punters into thinking they were in control to believe what they were seeing just as he does as a politician hes a prostitute but uses power instead of sex okay maybe it wasnt completely necessary but he is a pimp "
"77" "Californiafan" 2011-05-31 " ned stark taught his son that when you condemned a man you are responsible for the execution yourself i can imagine tywin lannisers father teaching him that when he kills a deer he should know how to butcher it if neededtywins every move showed him to be an experienced butcher taking pleasure in swift skillful gutting and skinning on the battlefield tywin would cut down his opponents with the same swift skill hopefully he wasnt into skinning them was that a deer it was so large i thought it was an elk "

"79" "dotmegsam" 2011-05-31 " oh by the way sad to say goodbye to mark addy who has been excellent i think tributes to characters who are killed in ugly ways may become a regular feature perhaps worth keeping count of alongside violence and nudity "
"80" "dotmegsam" 2011-05-31 " the series is really firing on all cylinders now so much so that i didnt even mind the tyrion absence good to see the action back at the wall ironic that jon snow seems for the time being the safest of the starksand ned poor ned as a non reader of the source books i dont know but a bad fate seems inevitable for someone so innocent and convinced of the goodwill of others cersei has warned him and i think tried to save him on a couple of occasions but he has been blind to the consequences of his actions aiden gillen is excellent as littlefinger and watching him reminds me that the show has some of the political scope of the wire in showing how the self interest of factions of a society produce ruthless clashes and betrayalsdont want to give in to prudishness over the nudity and at least the show has preserved some sense of equality in the display of male as well as female flesh but i would hope it serves the story as well as pushing some sort of taste boundary "
"81" "Werthead" 2011-05-31 " an explanation for ross prominence i would really like is if shes one of varyss little birds he says in episode 3 that he has agents in the north and they told him catelyn was coming to kings landing its the sort of thing i could see theon letting slip during one of his visits for example and she could pass it on there is also a possible clue to this in episode 1 when ros tells tyrion that they were warned of his coming i dont really see pycelle writing to luwin oh and tell the whorehouse to brace for tyrions arrival or luwin passing that message on assuming the brothels of westeros dont have their own independent message service it just seems a weird if amusing thing to happen of course if ros had been told by varys about tyrions arrival that would make more sense and she just slipped up this would also explain why ros has now been sent to kings landing an opportunity to get an agent in littlefingers hq is likely something varys would be very keen on indeed "
"82" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-31 " werthead  re the jorah scene true although i always thought it was a bit unclear in the book as to whether he acts because of how he feels for daenerys or because he has been told otherwise i thought it played quite nicely on screen because to me at least it was left unclear why he intervened and whether it was out of selfinterest or a final rejection of his past in favour of the young khaleesi "
"83" "SarahHughes" 2011-05-31 " nice to see the perverts winning out here more seriously i didnt have so much of a problem with the actual sex so much as not really seeing what the point of it was  i mean its nice that the actress playing ros is prepared to show so much flesh if you fancy seeing it but it didnt really add much to the scene in my personal opinion and while i see sunbursts point about the reveal with littlefinger being a cheap shot in the books where you never really see it coming i obviously prefer my shots cheap as i rather missed the gasp that should have come from my husband who instead was all well i havent been waiting for that to happen for the last 45 minutes generally i like the added in scenes but in this case i felt it was a bit overdone also i agree with bellatrixiestrange that im getting a little bit bored of watching the citzens of westeros explain their pasts to a passing whore we get it hbo you like to push the boundaries but is it too much to occasionally expect a bit of backstory in a place other than a bed lalwende  agreed it was a very good scene and one i considered going into more detail about i thought that natalia tena has been quite eyecatching in a small role so far and i liked the way in which we were shown that theon might think ironmen are a breed apart from the likes of the starks but the free wilding folk genuinely are "
"84" "Werthead" 2011-05-30 " interestingly charles dance was a big fan of the books apparently hed read them a few years earlier and had already identified tywin as the character hed be bestsuited to play should it ever get on screen given that he was the producers 1 choice for the role before they even knew that it all fitted together nicely it also helped that dance was filming the movie your highness at the paint hall when the producers flew in for a set and location scout so they didnt even need to fly him in specially to offer him the part synchronicity overall a solid episode aside from the sexposition at the start which is a cliche the show is falling back on too often something that the episode really made unclear was what the deal was with jorah saving dany we know from a couple of eps back that varys is apparently working with illyrio to bring viserys and daenerys home to claim the throne when illyrio mentions that theyre going to have to wait on drogos own timetable to invade varys suggests that he should hurry up he then approves roberts decision to send an assassin after daenerys so what appears to happen and you can read it this way in the book is that varys sends the assassin to kill dany as robert orders but also tips jorah off and tells him to stop it when the assassin fails it enrages drogo and convinces him to indeed hurry up and invade westeros as varys wanted however in the episode it appears that jorah has a change of heart rejects his royal pardon and saves daenerys out of the goodness of his heart sure you can just about read it that he was deliberately working on orders here as well but its not the reading that immediately suggests itself another possibility is that the plan was for the assassin to actually kill daenerys so enraging drogo that hed invade anyway and seat viserys on the throne viseryss death  which varys hasnt heard about yet  may have compelled jorah to take some initiative here its still a somewhat fuzzy point though "
"85" "MerinoTeflonz" 2011-05-30 " i havent read the books yet but i think that if other casual viewers didnt realise before this episode that littlefinger could possibly be a duplicituous sort i should go on and say something cleverthat said petyrs declaration of character was heavyhanded but being a disgusting pervert i never have any issues with gratuitous womanonwoman actioni also thought that tywins butchery masterclass was impressive damn whatever symbolism may have been intendedi have sympathy for ned to a degree but he is a plank "
"86" "DiamondDag" 2011-05-30 " oh my charles dance was worth the wait tywin wasnt the most fleshed out of characters in the book so its exciting to see this portrayal couldnt of picked a better actor to convey that calculating menace have to disagree with sunburst even though i knew the outcome at the end still got my heart racing like that scene did in the book personally i think to go along with the violence and nudity count this blog should have kept tabs on how many poor bloody winterfell guardsmen get impaled with spears must be one of the most lethal jobs in the realm watching neds back "
"87" "WillieMillerisGod" 2011-05-30 " littlefinger you bastard "
"88" "UninventiveName" 2011-05-30 " i thought charles dance as tywin was a great call really enjoyed that scene as well i didnt think him skinning the deer was too much cracking episode everything building up nicely the pacing in the majority of hbo series is always spoton dont know how they manage it so consistently also i have to say hats off to jason momoa all hes had to do so far is look like an absolute unit and grunt occasionally so for him to bring such charisma and adrenaline to a speech given in a madeup language was massively impressive i suppose it did mainly consist of him slapping his pecs but whatever it worked "
"89" "Sunburst" 2011-05-30 " beatrixlestrange charles dance acted well as tywin lannister but him skinning the deer seemed a bit too obvious  also couldnt help but think surely he has servants to do that dirty work for him i think they wanted to make him look like a total badass so we should regard that as his hobby i mean if it wasnt for skinning the deer hed be what walking around the tent sharpening his sword or just sitting at the table ranting at jaime it wouldnt really pack a punch this was very visually effective and it conveyed a lot about his character you dont want to mess with tywin lannister the man could scare the living crap out of the white walkers glitterfairy11  yes i missed tyrion too  i didnt mind the littlefinger scene im really not surprised by sex scenes on hbo and his betrayal of ned makes sense after that scene as opposed to being just a cheap shock without it "
"90" "Lalwende" 2011-05-30 " charles dance was superb perfect casting him slicing up the deer carcass reminded me a lot of the character of bill the butcher in gangs of new york  he is a nasty man and nasty men have visceral hobbies the scene with osha and theon was good reminding us that there are some people in westeros who are even more northern than the starks and people who live in a very different way im glad we hear much more from theon in this than in the book as you dont get to see his full character nor hear anything about the iron islands until the second book "
"91" "glitterfairy11" 2011-05-30 " sunburst i completely agree i read the book since the program started so this is only the second episode where ive known whats going to happen it didnt seem to matter last week but this week i rather regretted it there was a big or rather small tyrion shaped hole for me hes frequently the highlight of an episode i do look forward to his barbs i could have really done without the littlefinger scene too both for the fact it detracted somewhat from the ending and the girlongirl stuff was just completely gratuitous "
"92" "redronin" 2011-05-30 " absolutely cracking episode though not quite as good as last weeksim a massive fan of the books but sometimes when watching this series i wish i was coming to it fresh as i can see all the twists coming wonder how many of the nonsoif readers anticipated littlefingers betrayal of ned for example though i agree with articles comment that the writers overplayed things a bit with his rant in the whorehouse for a start it just wasnt believable to me that hed be revealing his innermost thoughts to a whore hed just met ros got down to kings landing pretty damn quick by the way charles dance as tywin  another example of perfect casting i feel he brings just the right amount of smarm and menace to the role and it was a great intro to have him methodically slicing up the deer while lecturing jamie tywin is one of those characters like robert or littlefinger of whom you never follow as a pov in the books so im looking forward to plenty of extra scenes that give us more insight into his character apparently grrm himself is in charge of writing duties for episode 8 he picks one a season cant wait "
"93" "Bellatrixlestrange" 2011-05-30 " further random thoughts no further mention of cerseis first son the one that was actually roberts but died as an infant wonder if theyre going to do any with that eg a revelation that his death wasnt a natural one  murdered by jaime or by his own mother thats not a spoiler its genuine speculation the child wasnt featured in the book charles dance acted well as tywin lannister but him skinning the deer seemed a bit too obvious  also couldnt help but think surely he has servants to do that dirty work for him "
"94" "quirkypenguin" 2011-05-30 " i spent most of the episode shouting at ned for being so stupid i could barely watch the last scene also i dont think ive ever wanted to punch a child in the face so badly as i do with joffrey "
"95" "Bellatrixlestrange" 2011-05-30 " well we found out quickly what happened to ros the pros last glimpsed on a turnip cart heading south from winterfell shes now working for littlefinger who gets to tell his back story to the accompaniement of some extremely gratuitous lesbo action i can see the reason for the comments last week about getting your mother to put on the coffee during the first 20 minutes personally im getting a bit tired of people pouring out their hearts to whores i also agree with sarah above that littlefingers treachery was too heavily foreshadowed  more fun to keep the audience guessing that scene aside the rest of the show was totally riveting  loved the scenes at the wall yay ghost and over the narrow sea  iain glen was great as ser jorah and jason momoa finally got to demonstrate hes more than a piece of meat i missed tyrion and the stark girls but i guess they cant focus on all the characters all the time the devious plotting was beautifully portrayed mark addys last scene was done very well he will be sadly missed and the action was nailbiting even if you know whats going to happen quite jealous of people who havent read the books so get a surprise "
"96" "Sunburst" 2011-05-30 " i have to say the episode mostly relied on big shocks and twists and as a book reader i knew what was going to happen so it wasnt a very thrilling experience for me i imagine that nonreaders were well and truly shocked though i envy them drogos speech was lovely although slightly worrying as you could almost see on daenerys face drogo i will take my army across the sea on wooden boats like no khal before medaenerys yaydrogo i will fight vicious battles and destroy my enemiesdaenerys awesomedrogo i will give my beloveds homeland as a gift to our sondaenerys how sweet of himdrogo i will kill all the men and rape all the womendaenerys uhmmdrogo i will enslave all the children and burn down all citiesdaenerys oh shit "
