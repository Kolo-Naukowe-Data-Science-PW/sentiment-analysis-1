"4" "ID4712878" 2014-06-15 " had i not read the books i would doubtless have taken the tv series to heart with more élan but theres the rub rather like wild salmon to farmed the involvement with the book characters is of a richer deeper vein i hope mr martin is around long enough to finish the saga the years between books is sweet agony "

"6" "obviouspete" 2014-06-15 " and wtf happened to uncle benjen by the way i thought at the end of of the series where we see the white walkers moving south and their leader on a horse that that was him converted but because no other characters referenced it and there was no follow up i thought no maybe not but its unresolved isnt it "

"9" "jackiscool" 2014-06-14 " im not really sure what you wanted to skip one of the most important battles of the series a quick description of it "
"10" "jackiscool" 2014-06-14 " sorry but thats one of the most preposterous things ive ever read the reason the show works so well is because the showrunners know exactly whats going to happen  because they er have five completed books to draw from furthermore they have an entire outline of how the series of books finishes thats whats special about got there can be things foreshadowed for seasons before they come to fruition its truly a new phenomenon in tv "
"11" "gooddogs" 2014-06-14 " i loved the 360 fight scene that was awesome and i never use that word "

"15" "MonkEMan" 2014-06-13 " id have rather they dropped all that twerking about in crasters keep to give the epic battle of the wall due respect "
"16" "MonkEMan" 2014-06-13 " yes the end of the episode confused me as to how they are going to cram everything into the last episode  the trailer suggests that they are going to  id be disappointed if the end of the battle at the wall or tyrions date with the axe were not given the full works "
"17" "MonkEMan" 2014-06-13 " true sadly but i seem to remember olenna telling margery that she learnt everything about seducing men from her mother  olennas mother and aemon "
"18" "Drgonzo123" 2014-06-13 " they did we see stannis arrive in last season it saved davos from being killed they just choice to ignore it "
"19" "MonkEMan" 2014-06-13 " fair point  mance knew how few were left on the wall  a few hundred coming along the wall from either side would have finished them off quickly then climbed down and opened the gate "
"20" "Alfster" 2014-06-13 " yes the episode was one big sword fight but the wildings and those from beyond the wall are a bigger threat than those below the wall  it needed a whole episode to show the peril and danger that is there not the best episode of course but very important and one should hope that in a series where some of the best scenes are between two people just talking that a change in the way an episode is set up is a nice change and was dome for a reason "

"42" "Dartnall" 2014-06-12 " compared to the excellently choreographed and filmed battle scenes in vikings this was a dulllards display predictable bland only worth watching to keep up with the story and for sam jon snow had ten bells knocked out of him was half killed by the cannibal but a couple of hours later appeared spotlessly clean hair nicely crimped and without a single cut or bruise on him in vikings they wear their injuries and dirt with pride "

"62" "steve3742" 2014-06-12 " onthoudditwell has a point people have a weird sense of reality when it comes to science fiction or fantasy probably because its new to them back in the 20s and 30s there was plently of sf that was very unrealistic in the ways that onthoudditwell pointed out and one of the ways the genre developed  and became much better  was by eradicating it by having sf that was well written and had good science also ignoring this is a retrograde step few stories make sense when you think about themoveranalyse them to death  shakespeare dickens star wars well they all contain a lot of coincidences something you find with got but im not aware of any glaring innaccuracies in them and if there were dont you think theyd be better stories for clearing them up just because a series contains dragons white walkers and other stuff doesnt mean that it cant be realistic in other ways or that it shouldnt be one of the appeals of got is the way it strips out a lot of the cliches of fantasy so we have knights chivalry tournaments straight out of morte darthur  but once the war starts it gets brutal in ways that malory wouldnt contemplate this is realistic in an unexpected way to readers of traditional fantasy and its one of the reasons the books and tv series are so good so we have a 700 foot high wall and giants and mammoths these are the fantasy elements but does that mean that all the other rules of strategy tactics and siegecraft no longer apply the books presented the siege in a much better fashion more realistically but i suppose that wouldnt have looked as good there is a balance that has to be drawn between realism and what looks good  artistic license its called but it can be tricky to get the right side of it onthoudditwell points out a lot of problems why did the wildlings climb up the wall when there were people at the top ready to drop things on them and drop an anchor on them why not start the climb a mile to the west and then run along the top of the wall once they got to the top the rest of the wildlings would have kept the watch busy so theyd not have noticed till they got there it looks to me that the sole purpose was so they could show the anchor dropping and thats thouands of dollars of cgi that could have been better used elsewhere given that the climb took a day why do it at all dolorous eds comment about how theyll climb faster because theyre more motivated wouldnt work with that big and long a climb other points are less valid im willing to accept the flaming arrows as a the mediaval equivalent of tracer fire and b artistic licence ygrette picking up two flaming arrows is a continuity error though and not as forgiveable the giant went through the door in a fit of rage after all the others had routed hence it was just him and nobody else alliser thornes speech was to the reserveas the walls were being overrun  they had tried to defend them but had failed and yes ok a bit of artistic licence it did make tactical sense to keep people on the top as how else were they going to drop things on the wildlings the giants do seem to have been hit with arrows  the comment from one of grenns band about how he had 20 arrows in him already implies that  so it does seem they were targetting them just not effectively and yes grenns band should have has something  an arbalest or two some spears pike even  which would have been effective against the giant i think onthoudditwells point is that this is just sloppy writing a lot of it could have been corrected without sacrificing the visual imagery you seem to make the point that the spectacle is all as long as it looks good who cares how realistic it is but i think it does matter that you can only sacrifice realism for spectacle up to a point i dont think that point was totally crossed unlike onthoudditwell but it went near which always reminds me of poor mad annie wilkes standing up in that cinema and bellowing have you all got amnesia he didnt get out the cockadoodie car out of curiosity those matinee serials that showed a cliffhanger at the end of an episode and then next week showed a different cliffhanger that they easily escaped from  do you think they were well written good entertainment or was it sloppy writing for cheap spectacle and writing down to the audience by hoping theyd be too stupid to notice "

"91" "chriskilby" 2014-06-11 " nice i think you need to read my comment again the stakes were much higher at castle black whether joffrey or stannis sat on the iron throne meant precisely heehaw to the people of westeros or the grand scheme of things for that matter one of the overriding themes of got is that it doesnt matter who sits on the iron throne like melisandre said it is irrelevant a distraction a petty squabble among men nothing more as is becoming increasingly apparent as the series progresses this will be borne out when danys and brans identical vision finally comes to pass  the throne room of the red keep in ruins and the iron throne covered in snow this will be the final shot of the last ever episode winter is coming vallar morghulis etc another central theme is how everyone takes the nights watch completely for granted and openly mocks the dangers beyond the wall  theres no such thing as giants  which we have known from the very first episode to be real even tyrion sneers at snarks and grumpkins betraying a smug complacency which could yet be the death of them all the white walkers could win in the end maybe they deserve to what was it osha said robb and his army were marching the wrong way absolutely goddamn right if castle black fell andor the wall crumbled that would be the end for everyone it wouldnt just be mance rayders wildling army which would overrun westeros it would be the white walkers and their undead army as well sooner or later which is why ultimately whoever is left alive  stark lannister baratheon targaryn wildling and dragon  will have to unite against westeros common enemy the judean peoples front i mean the undead and another wee prediction  in that final battle to end all battles itll be dany tyrion and bran wholl be riding those dragons id bet the mountains balls on it its not the episode or my post you need to look at again its the bigger picture my dismissive friend talk about missing the point "
"92" "HashRouge" 2014-06-11 " i very much agree with you here i feel as though the show has become kings landingcentric perhaps because the directors know that the politics and back stabbery and cleverness as you brilliantly put it is one of the strongest elements of the show i think the reason that episodes such as the red wedding and the mountain vs the viper have been so successful is because they combine that element ie the political trickery with some good old fashioned blood and gore and of course shock tactics its made for some gripping television in contrast the battle at the wall was an impressive but more or less straight forward action sequence lacking the elements that make game of thrones so speciali also think the directors have done a lot with the other characters that are have been at kings landing  sansa tywin jamie cersei joffrey rip olenna margaery and of course the scenestealing oberyn martell maybe the fact that they usually have a significant number of interesting characters there at any one time means that it is easier for them to devote time to scenes there i dont know i certainly noticed that quite a lot of screen time has been devoted to characters who are actually fairly minor in the books  oberyn olenna margaery even tywin to a certain extent although he doesnt really count as a minor character i do understand why this has happened  all are brilliant characters played by excellent actors and oberyn and olenna certainly have almost cult status among book readers but its interesting that the directors etc havent done anything similar with characters at the wall this episode if it did anything reminded me that there are interesting characters at the wall we just dont see very much of them i really liked what they did with ser alliser thorne and janos slynt as i finally felt like they became three dimensional interesting characters rather than the stereotypical villains and seeing pyp and grenn die reminded me of what good characters they are  its a shame that we havent seen a bit more of them and of course of the brilliant dolorous edd its a real shame that we arent more invested in what happens at the wall because in theory we should be getting some really interesting politics and back stabbery and cleverness there very shortly the goings on at the wall start to rival those in kings landing if the show even remotely follows the books i seem to remember enjoying the scenes at the wall more than almost anything else during the fifth book they were one of the few saving graces of what was a fairly poor book in that respect im slightly annoyed that theyve killed off grenn and pyp because we need characters at the wall that we care about even if theyre only minor ones "

"102" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-11 " the band of wildlings attacking castle black wasnt that huge and the nw likely had better armour and such as well "
"103" "corkincali" 2014-06-11 " they are not that stupid given that modern machine guns use tracer bullets to see where you are firing i could well forgive archers firing 600 ft down using flames to see where the hell they are shooting "
"104" "keef1980" 2014-06-11 " woah that would have been the best thing ever "
"105" "whatorly" 2014-06-11 " i still enjoyed this episode but i felt it slipped into what got could have been if they hadnt done it properly  just another swords and sorcery fantasy drama i kept wishing for an interlude with arya or in kings landing just to break up the grim northern landscape the giants and mammoths were ok but it was very lotrs  and i want politics and back stabbery and cleverness  and where was the gratuitous nudity for goodness sake should have been a peak jaw dropping episode but i guess we had that last week next week i expect we will dally around all the other story lines in an unsatisfactory manner hey ho roll on the next season "
"106" "maclau1" 2014-06-11 " well in this we wont agree i know many who thought it was heretical that he was left out probably depends on your circle none the less its always good to hear from someone who has actually read the book as opposed to only seeing the movies "
"107" "tronald" 2014-06-11 " i know the role he played but he was just so annoying "
"108" "maclau1" 2014-06-11 " agree wholeheartedly "
"109" "tronald" 2014-06-11 " yeah really i hated him in the books and everyone ive ever spoken to about lotr said the same like jarjar binks in star wars i thought it was just a thing "
"110" "maclau1" 2014-06-11 " in real life i have red curly hair and beard and wear a tall yellow pointed hat no tom bombadill is a pivotal character in the book while having what seems to be a minor role he is the only one not affected by the ring and was old when the ring was first forged the departure from his home also signals the final step into the great unknown for the hobbits the movies are so flawed though this is hardly the largest oversight "
"111" "HashRouge" 2014-06-11 " i dont but then im finding i dont love very much about dany any more "
"112" "HashRouge" 2014-06-11 " eta the reason i wish that donal noye had been included is that its part of my wider belief that they could have done a lot more with the scenes at the wall and in developing our interest in scenes there "
"113" "HashRouge" 2014-06-11 " i totally agree with you about danys scenes i absolutely loved her scenes through season 1 and into season 2 but quite often i now find myself cringing when the actress so much as opens her mouth im not blaming the actress specifically some of the writing and directing for her character has been atrocious and hoping her scenes will be as short as possible i dont think its so much that the show has become tyrioncentric though as that it has become kings landingcentric obviously tyrions presence is part of the attraction of kings landing but i think the directors have also done a lot with the other characters that are were there  sansa tywin jamie cersei joffrey rip olenna margaery and of course the scenestealing oberyn martell maybe the fact that they usually have a significant number of interesting characters there at any one time means that it is easier for them to devote time to scenes there i dont know i certainly noticed that quite a lot of screen time has been devoted to characters who are actually fairly minor in the books  oberyn olenna margaery even tywin to a certain extent although he doesnt really count as a minor character i do understand why this has happened  all are brilliant characters played by excellent actors and oberyn and olenna certainly have almost cult status among book readers but its interesting that the directors etc havent done anything similar with characters at the wall or those who are with dany at the wall all scenes involve either sam or jon the two pov characters and similarly in the east all scenes involve dany apart from the recent missandei grey worm scenes the result seems to be that the show now spends far more time at kings landing than it used to although i dont know whether this is true or simply how it seems "
"114" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2014-06-11 " the battle of castle black was always a mismatch in terms of numbers but there was no need to add and add to the wildling advantage i dont have an issue with the smaller force holding out history has plenty of examples of small forces inflicting heavy losses on much bigger forces 300 spartans demons of the camerone etc but this should have been about triumph in planning strategy and discipline none of which the current incarnation of the watch have in abundance theyre a rabble and thorne actively stopped jon snow trying to make them better  they appear incompetent as they get blown up by their own barrels of tar etc  they get caught up in a pitched battle inside their own castle  janos slint despite being a veteran of the city watch is now a coward  the tunnel is a lot less fortified and doesnt have the murder holes and arrow fire 1 mistakes  equipment failures happen in battles all the time nothing to do with incompetence 2 they were caught up in a pitched battle in castle black because they chose not to engage the raiders in open country plus cb and all wall fortresses was actively designed to be easy to attack from the south lest the nw tries an insurrection against the iron throne 3 janos slynt was an overpromoted coward in kings landing why should he be any different at the wall 4 the tunnel was deliberately left unfortified by thorne who dismissed jon snows notion to block the tunnel as they discussed at length in the episode i am obviously not saying that losses were unexpected but it looked just too easy for the wildlings in the books the nights watch used a lot more clever tricks the only thing i saw was the ridiculous scythe if the tv series had revealed all those tricks without first establishing at least some of them it would have looked ridiculous akin to the power rangers or some other kids show goody getting battered before powering up at the end to defeat the baddie but what the heck was the sideshow with the deserters at crasters all about completely unnecessary and simply gratuitous again this was all explained in the series they had to sort the deserters because js told mance they had 1000 men at cb the deserters would have known otherwise and would have blabbed if discovered hence mance would have committed a larger force in the first battle and overwhelmed the nw "

"122" "steve3742" 2014-06-11 " i dont consider the whats come before in the story of the watchers on the wall long and tedious filler however furthermore is there a distinction between a long buildup and really long buildup the latter of which is the story of the wall and its defenders i dont think you can argue about the long part the wildlings first went on the march in the last ep of series 2 nearly 2 years ago now even f we reckon it from the beginning of season 3 thats over a year one of the reasons jon and ygrittes story had so little impact is that its been nearly a year since they were last together as for the tedious filler bit well what have the night watch actually done this season theyve sat around and talked about how to respond to the wildlings and launched an attack on crasters keep and thats it might have filled up 3 or 4 episodes but not 8 and the crasters keep bit was clearly filler its not in the books and served no real purpose dramatically speaking i agree there are a lot of exceptional events at the end of book 3 most if not all of which well be seeing next week  its 66 minutes at that it might struggle to fit them all in i mean there should be the ending of the siege of castle blackthe aftermath of the siege of castle blacktyrions appointment with the axebran and rickons journeyarya and the hound plus they might drop in on sansa jaime cersei and daenerys for completeness daenerys will probably have her first scene from dance with the reveal at the end and the season ender may well be brienne meeting up with a character we havent seen for a while  like the book epilogue "
"123" "MsEnvelop" 2014-06-11 " i think you are far too harsh i am not very young and i have never seen anything like this scale on tv before it was an extremely well crafted episode if you want something better than this i recommend that you do not waste your time with got or actually any tv production but go to iraq or syria to have the real experience and thrill "
"124" "lomier" 2014-06-11 " are you referring to the what appeared to be drogon’s shadow over kings landing that confused me in the trailers too but the shot was part of bran’s visions at the weirwood tree near the start of season 4 if so if not what scene are you referring to "

"128" "crehane" 2014-06-11 " youre taking it all just a little too seriously mate if what we were talking about here was the accurate depictionrecreation of historical factsbattles then the accuracy nitpicking might be warranted but since this is a fantasy tv show its overkill also on a similar note are you going to tell me that the battles as depicted in lotr movies are realistic also as per both points above got is a tv show they dont have the time or the budget for what youre expecting what youre engaging in at this stage is tantamount to trolling as already pointed out to you you need to change the record you need to relax mate realise that this is an extremely well made tv show and appreciate it for its entertainment value "
"129" "Dweezle" 2014-06-11 " loved the whole episode the only down side is i think it makes a movietv series about druss the legend even less likely "
"130" "bolbobiggins" 2014-06-11 " why do you need to pad when you omit so much from the books its more of a case of hbo having to meet their quota for gore sexual violence and boobs this is an issue endemic within hbo amc manages to give us great drama without the need for shoehorning sexual and ultraviolent content "
"131" "Raycun" 2014-06-11 " yes they should know how badly defended the wall is because they have people who can possess birds and see through their eyes so attack a weaker point with a gate or send more people over the wall to attack castle black from behind or send a lot of people to the top of the wall and attack cb along the top of the wall what is the point of climbing a thousand foot high wall with defenders waiting at the top and why let the giant go in alone he could have held the gate open for 500 people to fight through the tunnel i think there were more attackers in the book "
"132" "pdboxer" 2014-06-11 " the inclusive end to the siege seems to leave an awful lot of storylines to tie up next week im interested to see how theyre going to fit everything in exactly i was expecting a messenger to come up that lift to the top of the wall just as jon snow was saying how the fuck do we get out of this now and tell him its ok  weve been renewed for seasons 5 and 6 and if we can beat the sopranos then i cant see a bunch of wildlings and giants giving us too much trouble "

"136" "FifiNerd" 2014-06-11 " two different spellings of mance in this article "
"137" "crehane" 2014-06-11 " come to think of it even if the wildlings had suceeded id reckon it would be a pretty tight squeeze to get a mammoth through that tunnel under the wall the giant fairly filled that space on his own "
"138" "randombloke" 2014-06-11 " its a shame that rik mayalls death means that therell be no cameo from lord flashheart hed have been bloody brilliant in kings landing "
"139" "crehane" 2014-06-11 " for the record i really enjoyed this episode and i dont find the wall stuff as tedious as some do however for those who have a problem with this episode and the wall stuff in general i do think that part of the problem is related to pacing if we bear in mind that jon snows sortie to neutralise crasters keep happen in episode 5 then the next time we see anything relating to the wall is a few minutes in episode 7 when jon returns to castle black and tries to convince thorne et al to floodblock the tunnel then in episode 8 there are a couple of short scenes relating to the wall story molestown is ransacked and the nightswatch discuss the implications of same then episode 9 is all wall so to speak i think that perhaps this pacing problem could have been allieviated if the show makers had inserted a couple of scenes somewhere into either episode 7 or preferrably episode 8 in these scenes manse rayders men would have reached craster keep and discovered that it has been destroyed from here they could then have had a scene where mance gives the order to advance on the wall inserting two such scenes would have up the tension and would have done a lot to help contextualise the events which then unfolded over the course of episode 9 "
"140" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2014-06-11 " depending which trailer youre referring to there are elements of new and old dragon footage within them however there are definitely dragons in the final episode of series 4 as evidenced by the teaser for that already broadcast "

"145" "PatriciaPJ" 2014-06-11 " yes i know and the giants and their steeds were amazing  i suppose it was all the fighting which i close my eyes and put my fingers in my ears for lots of doing that in this episode before anyone points it out i am indeed a big girls blouse "

"153" "Gladiatrix" 2014-06-11 " yes but by taking on too much of his eastern subjects culture he alienated his own men he also failed to instill any great loyalty in the men who were supposed to be his band of brothers all of whom the moment alexander was dead set about slaughtering alexanders immediate family including his mother his sisters his widow and his son and dividing alexanders empire among themselves ptolemy even stole alexanders corpse "

"191" "DiamondDag" 2014-06-10 " well if you didnt like thats fair enough do remember they have a budget and a shooting schedule though i simply dont think they have the time or money to look at something like this from every angle and make it water tight for what its worth i think a lot of your criticisms are answered in the episode "
"192" "bolbobiggins" 2014-06-10 " i think the problem is that the show runners have changed things from the book there is nothing wrong with changes but in this episode the majority were illogical and didnt seem to enhance the drama anymore than having a competent black watch "
"193" "DCBuzz" 2014-06-10 " well i was actually there and the burning arrows looked quite cool at the time too "
"194" "bolbobiggins" 2014-06-10 " the battle of castle black was always a mismatch in terms of numbers but there was no need to add and add to the wildling advantage i dont have an issue with the smaller force holding out history has plenty of examples of small forces inflicting heavy losses on much bigger forces 300 spartans demons of the camerone etc but this should have been about triumph in planning strategy and discipline however the show runners have decided to do anything they can to stack the odds higher against the blacks watch  they appear incompetent as they get blown up by their own barrels of tar etc  they get caught up in a pitched battle inside their own castle  janos slint despite being a veteran of the city watch is now a coward  the tunnel is a lot less fortified and doesnt have the murder holes and arrow fire if you watch the rate they are dying at you wonder how they werent all dead by the time jon snow arrived heck ygritte could have killed 100 herself at the rate she was going i am obviously not saying that losses were unexpected but it looked just too easy for the wildlings in the books the nights watch used a lot more clever tricks the only thing i saw was the ridiculous scythe and i hate to be one of those guys who complains about changes to the books in the first series of game of thrones the changes made almost always made sense or even improved things its expected that a book with pov characters requires change to work as a show jamies scene in the white tower with joffrey is a good example of this in the books jamie is on his own looking at the white book and considering his place in history compared to some of the great knights however as a show this wouldnt work so you have joffrey there taunting him about it it was logical and worked but what the heck was the sideshow with the deserters at crasters all about completely unnecessary and simply gratuitous "
"195" "onthoudditwel" 2014-06-10 " ehm ppl do this with everything it doesnt matter if its a fictional battle it just doesnt make sense and i cant watch this episode without getting distracted by those mistakes its bad clearly they didnt take enough time to fix the errors as i said the arrows look cool for the ppl who watch the show however it doesnt make sense tactically "
"196" "onthoudditwel" 2014-06-10 " clearly u didnt see all the mistakes it was really bad u are just overwhelmed by the fact that u finally see some action in got "
"197" "onthoudditwel" 2014-06-10 " it is in my list of worst battle ever the thingy at blackwater wasnt even worthy of calling a fight this was a fight only the mistakes made it really bad the fighting was not interesting and there were 0 tactics the only thing that was positive that i could say are the cool stuff  the scythe was a nice idea even though it is completely used wrong and unrealistic  also the hanging archers was nice "
"198" "DiamondDag" 2014-06-10 " youre trying to apply logic to a fictional battle that was never intended to be an intricate look at warfare its just a dramatic tool and a piece of entertainment thats why the arrows are on fire "
"199" "onthoudditwel" 2014-06-10 " the flames are also stupid the only reason why the arrows where on fire is to let the ppl who watch the show see the arrows its tactically stupid to put arrows on fire specially at night because the ppl u shoot at can see the arrows coming but this episode had more mistakes than an everage teen mom "
"200" "onthoudditwel" 2014-06-10 " got wont show interesting stuff thats why this was the first real big fight still it sucked since they made so many mistakes "
"201" "onthoudditwel" 2014-06-10 " blackwater sucked wasnt even interesting and this episode was better yes but it still wasnt good so many mistakes i cant watch around it "
"202" "onthoudditwel" 2014-06-10 " too bad everyone is too overwhelmed by the fact that got finally shows some action that they forget that this episode was really bad the bad story line the tactical mistakes no tactics whatsoever the mistakes unclear things etc before u read the rest i would like to say that im not english and i am not trying to write this perfect i wont proof read this  everyone knew the wildlings would attack behind the wall why did they have so few men down there the wall was kinda safe the climb is long and the attack was faster more men down there before the fight would have started would be normal and if u find out the attack is happening u send more men  shooting with flaming arrows why would u do that at night ppl can see ur arrows coming they can see when they are shot and can dodge them only reason this is done is because the ppl who watch the show can see the arrows better and it will look cooler ygitte shoots during her run to the gates with 2 flaming arrows u can see that she didnt pick them up from the ground and her arrows are not buring how the guards just simply let the wildlings climb the wall just saying they have no training is not an excuse every person can do that without training maybe not when scarred but still also listening to a speach instead of getting ready the only reason that the wildlings behind the wall would attack was to attack from 2 sides distraction etc and with a chance to take over the place in order to take over the elevator if they wanted a distraction they should have waited longer with the attack oke communication problems but still the first rule would be all make sure that the elevator is ours just saying wildlings are stupid and have no fighting experience  not aiming for the giants take down the most important all together no they wait till they are at the gate etc  every time changing leader with every time they say the same thing nock drawl loose giant got mad and opend the gate alone giant didnt hold the gate open u cant say the giant is stupid and they didnt speak their language the most important thing during that fight was that gate even when the giant went threw that gate some wildlings could have followed him  the 6 men vs the giant didnt have a bow and arrow why fire with arrows at the wildlings climbing the wall why drop the scythe giant ankor at that moment killing those few men doesnt make sense it are easy kills when they try to climb over the wall  but mostly if u outnumber 1000 to 1 but u are in a shitty situation the only way to win is to put all ur troops at 1 what if during dday the americans would only have send 1 ship per day this just doesnt make sense  also the wall is big why would they climb at that excact spot in my opions this episode wasnt good the many mistakes made it feel bad the camera shots where not got like the fights were not even cool the scythe was a cool thing and they played this fight on that thing  the archers hanging down the wall 2 things that were cool cant make an episode i really dislike this since they wont show the rest of the fight in the final episode got doesnt make sense "
"203" "Drgonzo123" 2014-06-10 " sam i really like you theres no chance we can ever be together lilly only if you can promise me youll never die sam you know i cant promise that gilly if you did that i would make love to you right now sam i promise i will never die westerso fk yeah "

"208" "gerold" 2014-06-10 " all killed north of the wall will most likely become undead and will increase the threat join or die exactly this point is so obvious yet its ignored on both sides of the wall its actually a plot weakness both for the show and the books as long as the white walkers could be dismissed as storybook grumpkins it was understandable but once it became clear they were back then it should have been clear the watch and the wildlings were on the same side mance and tormund should know it mormont and snow even the got players down south "
"209" "keef1980" 2014-06-10 " tormund the one who is like tom baker in blackadder and his group were with jon snow last series  their job was to climb the wall and scout to find out the strength of the nights watch they were then going to give a signal for when the army should march on the wall  so the ones skirmishing were tormunds "
"210" "LordMeowingtons" 2014-06-10 " great episode loved the fact there was only one ad break as well aside from the battle and fighting which i really enjoyed watching my favourite part had to be when maester aemon is telling sam about when he was in love when he was younger how he remembered what she looked like etc it was really well acted and i wanted that scene to last longer you felt for the old guy it ended all too quickly for my liking cannot bloomin wait for next weeks episode no idea how theyre going to move around all the different stories and at least move them all on to a point that sets them up for next season "
"211" "Kelley Mickey" 2014-06-10 " did the wildlings attack from both sides of the wall i think i missed something wasnt all the action on the south side of the wall the north side had the giant fires but did they also attack from the north it just didnt seem to me that there were that many people attacking the wall especially if youve got an army of 100k ill have to watch again "
"212" "Tomé Morrissy-Swan" 2014-06-10 " this episode  battle of the blackwater "
"213" "AJ Dembroski" 2014-06-10 " that was the point of the sortie to crasters keep mance doesnt know he believes what jon snow told him remember mance has no idea jon turned coat after going over the wall that there were 10x as many men defending the wall as there are "
"214" "Doug Johnston" 2014-06-10 " for me the clue was in the credits i think it only listed 5 people compared to the usual 16 or so and i recognised the names of the actors as being wallrelated i was a little disappointed at first but it turned out awesome in the end imho "
"215" "Doug Johnston" 2014-06-10 " i have a horrible feeling ramsay will win that one hes just more mental but not arrogant like karl tanner was im hoping he either gets wiped out by the wildlings or a white walker "
"216" "Doug Johnston" 2014-06-10 " branns story only really interested me when he possessed hodor "
"217" "Doug Johnston" 2014-06-10 " although i didnt want any of the nights watch to die apart from janos slynt i do quite like the idea of the wildling army if you can call it that marching south and attacking kings landing the same time daenerys does hopefully one of the armies will wipe out the dreadfort in the process id say which one but my got geography is rubbish i know it might be a logical impossibility if youve read the books but i havent and i like to dream "
"218" "Doug Johnston" 2014-06-10 " theres 10 episodes of rectify starting june 19th watch season 1 before then if youve not already that should take you to midaugust then i think sons of anarchy starts again mid september "
"219" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-10 " well why do you think they should be destroying something right now what is their goal in the end in any case i think they are biding their time possibly building up their numbers and possibly waiting for things down south to really go bad if westeros is in chaos that is a lot of potential wight recruits for them from the dead there are a lot of questions yet left unanswered do the ww wait for winter or is winter coming something to do with the ww what is the relation between the return of the ww the return of dragons and the new powers of the followers of the red god supposedly the red god is opposed in some way to an evil god in the north is the ww or their god or is it a total lie and they are in fact the same evil force  they seem to have some similar powers with regards to reanimation i think there is a lot still unexplained and many possibilities as far as what could happen "
"220" "Kelley Mickey" 2014-06-10 " that sounds good to me "
"221" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-10 " no they couldnt have got that many over the did get some over the thenns who are the most disciplined troops and attacked castle black from both sides which is the sensible thing to do if they want to get the tunnel "
"222" "Ryan Brighton" 2014-06-10 " i was hoping for an alan rickman in prince of thieves style performance from sutherland but he sounded like an elderly canadian trying to speak with new dentures "
"223" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-10 " i wonder though how true it is that they were pushed up there i mean it is certianly possible but it is a myth from some 8000 years ago so it seems possible that the story could include some spin it seems likely that some of them may have been peoples who always lived in the north others may not have been pushed up there but went there because they did not want to live under the southern feudal system i think a difference with the native americans is that ethnically the wildlings are from the first men  the same as the vast majority of the rest of the people in the north it isnt like they were there first and were then displaced by newcomers so whatever happened to cause the separation of the wildlings and other northerners it was after they had all come in and displaced the children of the forest i dont remember the thenns being cannibals in the book or so weird either but there is a lot more insight into their culture and way of life there is a great song called the last of the giants that makes igritte cry when they sing it on the march "

"227" "crehane" 2014-06-10 " a few points to be made here 1 the wildlings are unaware of how understrength the nightswatch actually is 2 the wildlings are trying to get their entire society men women and children oh and giants and mammoths to the other side of the wall they need to capture castle black and the tunnel for this 3 thirdly they need to accomplish point 2 above fairly soon ie before the white walkers catch up to them 4 as already pointed out here they wouldnt have the equipment to enable thousands of wildlings to scale the wall 5 again as already pointed out here from a tactical point of view the top of the wall would be so narrow as to negate numerical superiority ie twenty or thirty nightswatch armed with spears could hold off a thousand wildlings attacking along the top of the wall "
"228" "keef1980" 2014-06-10 " yeah it happened off screen but grenn rallied the rest of the boys and killed the giant as it came through the wall "
"229" "Olivia Holly Ancell" 2014-06-10 " what happened to the giant that was storming through the tunnel did the boys manage to kill it before it got into castle black "
"230" "crehane" 2014-06-10 " yes have to agree that that little face off and weary smile with ygritte spoke a thousand unspoken words the last time i saw you you shot me three times so if youre going to do it again then just get it over with then she hesitates theres hope in jons heart perhaps theres a chance for them yet nope shes taken an arrow way above the knee and shes gonna kark it mate so sad "
"231" "aliquidcow" 2014-06-10 " i dont really get why mance would bother testing their defences when he must have known full well that he could have just ploughed straight on through and massacred everyone with the numbers he has anyway after that big actionfilled episode next week i expect well get lots of characterbased story developments as we catch up with the rest of the characters itll be a doozy i reckon "

"236" "crehane" 2014-06-10 " i think that ygrittes actions over the course of this season wanton and indiscriminate destruction and murder meant that i really didnt care too much when she died i saw her death at the hands of ollie as a come uppance of sorts by shooting john snau full of arrows and murdering innocents all round her she betrayed any affection i might have built up for her good riddance to that murderous ginger minge i say although she was cute and hot for a psychopathic wildling wench "
"237" "Kamanyo" 2014-06-10 " i didnt mean that they are all sweetness they certainly arent just that as a form of government they do not seem more objectionable than what goes on in the rest of westeros  but neither do they seem like much of an improvement i guess all forms of government in game of thrones seem pretty crappy the sort of freedom and lack of coded laws that the wildlings have allows for aberrations like craster but perhaps less violent and twisted configurations are possible i think the analogy with native americans is apt the north of the wall is like one big reservation and so it makes sense that they should raid what lies south since they were forcibly excluded from more productive and amenable lands even if their violence is excessive you cant fully fault them nor or they more violent than anyone else in westeros some of the cultural analogies with native americans  canibalism animism for instance  are a bit superficial in their treatment at least in the series perhpas the books do a better job but if we have been privy to little development of the nights watch we know even less of the wildlings with their tribes and mastodons and giants some interesting stuff up north "
"238" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2014-06-10 " again i am in agreement the challenge the tv series faces is that because the books arent done we cant judge what the show does against a fully complete story hence several storylines which have been relatively underserved hitherto may assume greater importance later on similarly storylines which have had great focus to this point may go into a lull for a while until everything is brouight back together for the climax of both tv series and books "
"239" "crehane" 2014-06-10 " wondering the same myself is he dead never explicitly shown so i dont think so or is he still alive and languishing in the dungeons beneath dragonstone "

"241" "BeheadtheRoyals" 2014-06-10 " this is pretty decent httpwwwlarepublicape "
"242" "crehane" 2014-06-10 " i believe that probably the best reason for the ww delay is the fact that at present they would find it very difficult to traverse the barrier of the wall this extends beyond the wall as a physical barrier as if legend is to be believed the wall is also a magical barrier the wall was contructed by the first men with the help of the children of the forest to keep the white walkers out its construction also involved the placing of magical wards to keep the white walkers out as such the white walkers would need these magical wards breached before they would stand any chance of being able to move south against the seven kingdoms in light of the above perhaps the white walkers are waiting for the wildlings to inadvertantly do this dirty deed for them "
"243" "RobinsonRM" 2014-06-10 " the identity of theons torturer was an actual mystery whereas stannis heading to the wall wasnt a mystery because thats what he said he was going to do in the actual script he actually said the words its not my fault youve all forgotten a bit of dialogue from the season 3 finale ive spent the whole of season 4 waiting for him to arrive i havent read the books by the way "

"245" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-10 " bored by giants riding wooly mammoths wtf "
"246" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-10 " he was wearing crow uniform when back with the wildings tho "
"247" "dsk84" 2014-06-10 " its like the identity of theons torturer from the previous season there are enough clues to work out who it may have been but its not obvious to everyone so best not to say it "
"248" "dsk84" 2014-06-10 " i think that people being bored by this episode is to an extent the show being a victim of its own popularity it has gone well and beyond something thats just for fans of fantasyadventure it has a large fan base that seem to be in it only for the drama and dont really care much for the fantasyactionadventure side of it so when an episode comes up that is heavily that aspect that particular fan base gets bored as for someone who is a fantasyadventure fan who also likes the drama side of the show episodes like this were a very enjoyable change of pace and direction "
"249" "RobinsonRM" 2014-06-10 " i dont know its actually happening thats why i posed it as a question and moreover its obvious because it was in the season 3 finale i havent read the books i used my brain to work it out do you have one of those "
"250" "WhereToCaptain" 2014-06-10 " maybe turn up your tv  monitor brightness looked fine to me "
"251" "RobinsonRM" 2014-06-10 " battle scenes are as good or bad as the budget you throw at the cgi for example the kings landing battle was quite poor mostly consisting of closeups of the main characters rather than wide angle vistas of thousands of men engaging each other it didnt seem like a heroic victory more a skirmish between a couple of dozen men "
"252" "dsk84" 2014-06-10 " there are times i wished i didnt either but this is certainly one time that im glad i do two less months to try and pass my time "
"253" "BeheadtheRoyals" 2014-06-10 " according the series development he might still be rowing but in the books you have to read them "
"254" "dsk84" 2014-06-10 " agreed she did nail that scene when she turned on the slavers after acquiring the dragons might have been cause she was speaking in valyrian but it was very well done her character is crying out for more scenes like that even if they arent quite as dramatic "
"255" "crehane" 2014-06-10 " a very good point here jon snow has a good chance of blagging his way back into mance rayders camp also by the time jon snow and the wildling raiding party went their separate ways they were south of the wall as such mance is probably oblivious of jons betrayal "

"262" "dsk84" 2014-06-10 " the battle didnt seem to last much longer after ygritte was killed so that does make him stopping with her for so long seem more believable less believable was ygritte seemingly hitting a target with every shot and not running out of targets after about 5 minutes "

"270" "crehane" 2014-06-10 " yeah but since sam looks like the hero least likely to kill a white walker nobody listened to him something they will ultimately come to regret methinks "

"272" "WhereToCaptain" 2014-06-10 " but they were overrun almost immediately im talking about castle black not the wall  how did the nights watch ie with a couple of exceptions not very good fighters  remember pyp saying ive never thrown a spear before ive never held a sword with a proper edge survive in hand to hand combat against the thenns and wildlings ie presumably much much better fighters "

"275" "James Minglis" 2014-06-10 " i didnt say i was bored or that it wasnt a good episode i know you didnt i was talking about other people commenting as an aside its probably going to get worse but then thats probably true of all the characters not just the wall yep its hit its peak the writers will try and do something to make it more eventful than books 4 and 5 but as the added scenes this season have shown i imagine that will be their undoing sad "
"276" "crehane" 2014-06-10 " yep could be right there im surprised that some uberfan hasnt done an official nightswatch body count from last nights episode yet by my conservative estimations the nightswatch must have lost at least half 50 of their men as outright dead in last nights battle in addition there would have to be another 20 or so that are too injured to be fit for active duty as such the best that the nightswatch could hope for is to have about 30 able bodied men left to fight less one jon snow which equals 29 able bodied men many of whom are probably builders and stewards an untenable position imho "
"277" "Cosmonaut" 2014-06-10 " i guess most people probably knew it but i was surprised to see that the director of this episode  neil marshall  is the same neil marshall that directed dog soldiers and another wallbased action film involving keeping out fantasy scots  doomsday "
"278" "steve3742" 2014-06-10 " ok if you have a battle at night you can keep it confined to a small area the visible area if its during daytime the visible area goes up drastically  and so does the cost of the cgiextras hence unless youre making a feature film or want to have a battle with only a few dozen people a side being visible its at night "
"279" "TheOtherInigo" 2014-06-10 " yes an episode that comes as a climax to a long buildup can be better than an episode that comes after lots of long and tedious filler no matter how good the actual episode is i dont consider the whats come before in the story of the watchers on the wall long and tedious filler however furthermore is there a distinction between a long buildup and really long buildup the latter of which is the story of the wall and its defenders i do think there was a thwarting of expectations that has affected the reactions of some to this episode and that is that the exceptional event of each season is revealed in episode nine the problem for the translators of grrms work is that book 3 had so many of these events  its no coincidence that its regarded as the most popular book to date  that theyve had to split them between episodes 9 and 10 "

"282" "zTom" 2014-06-10 " well that scene with the baby could be understood as establishing what the white walkers are doing after a millenium or was it several millenia of slumber they are slowly building up their numbers again the wights might form the brunt of their armies but each white walker is potential a one man platoonarmy the more of them the bigger the armies and higher the number of fronts they can attack on eventually i think that one issue concerning them is that the cliffhanger of season 2 appeared to show them on the move when they weren’t even attacking the wall as i initially believed just dispatching the few crows that had come too close to their base before retreating in it and continuing their preparations "
"283" "steve3742" 2014-06-10 " i didnt say i was bored or that it wasnt a good episode just that as you said there were some prety dramatic things that happened and their impact would have been greater had those characters actually done anything of interest over the past nine weeks id have been more interested in them then and im not using blackwater as a standard i was merely showing one of the reasons it was such a good episode and contrasting that with this all the characters in blackwater had had significant story arcs leading up to the episode and so when it happened it was with familiar people we cared about watchers on the wall  not so much because of the issues this season every time theyve popped up over the last 9 weeks its been with a sense of meh not these guys again as an aside its probably going to get worse but then thats probably true of all the characters not just the wall "
"284" "crehane" 2014-06-10 " it would be more likely that he wouldcould convince the nightswatch to back off and let the wildlings through on the understanding that in exchance for sanctuary they aid in the defence of the wall against the white walkers although thats the scooby doo ending and this being got you know its not going to happen that way "
"285" "16ghostly" 2014-06-10 " yeah edd is maybe the funniest character in the books not named tyrion but in the show i had no idea which one he was until this episode "
"286" "16ghostly" 2014-06-10 " i think i disagree with this the thing that preceded ygrittes death was ghost being released among the fighting my guess is within the small band fighting in castle black ghost was laying waste and sowing a lot of chaos remember that grey wind had been a major factor in robbs ability to win battles now why jon didnt unlock ghost earlier i have no idea anyway a little kid was occasionally turning a giant wheel in the middle of the melee so why couldnt jon stop for a second with ygritte the point is supposed to be that he doesnt care whats happening around him because she is more important than his safety at that moment "
"287" "jimmy_mac" 2014-06-10 " i have no doubt that he was lying to sam and he is going to mance to broker some sort of truce yes that partially answers why jon departed castle black without his sword and wolf he is definitely becoming a leader which raises further questions who will follow him and what are his aims i dont believe jon seeks ascension to the iron throne perhaps as you suggest his aim is to destroy the whitewalkers maybe he simply wants to fight on the side of the living as he answered when mance questioned why he wanted to join the rebellion "
"288" "James Minglis" 2014-06-10 " its night "

"293" "Nicholas Fletcher" 2014-06-10 " because its a tv series not a multi million pound 3 hour installment of a trilogy intended fro cinema release maybe "
"294" "weeyin" 2014-06-10 " i found the whole episode a bit boring to be honest i have never been the biggest fan of the battle scenes and as technically well crafted as this was would have been quite happy if it had just been reported rather than strung out for 45 mins "
"295" "DarksidePaul" 2014-06-10 " i think got should be best served as a box set watch rather than week by week but who can wait for it all to fin last seasons red wedding finale was the same with some of the grim details from the book such as the wolfs head on robs body and the boltons turning on the starks spilling over into the last episode i spent most of this week wondering when mance was gonna make an appearance i dont think its suicide on jons part to go parlay and it was a nice way to have a to be continued ending if youve seen next weeks promo youll know they have a lot to cover from all over the realm its called the children so we may have a couple of big surprises like who brienne and pod might run into in the riverlands  "
"296" "steve3742" 2014-06-10 " can you see that an episode that comes as a climax to a long buildup can be better than an episode that comes after lots of long and tedious filler these things filter through to the episode itself "
"297" "MikeyMcP" 2014-06-10 " excellent episode thrilling from the start to finish and right decision to focus solely on the battle much like blackwater in season 2 this is a show at the top of its game right now i love boardwalk empire but by 4th series it felt like it was running out of steam got on the other hand still feels like its just warming up "
"298" "maclau1" 2014-06-10 " i re watched thus episode of got last evening partly due to sarahs excellent commentary i actually liked it more the second time through so much so i picked up my ipad to continue where i left off in the series of the books and closed it after about three pages its funny to me that as much as i admire and love the hobbit and lotr as literature i loathe the films jackson departure from the original content and his inability to tell a convincing story is overwhelming great actors dismal direction yet in got i actually care about the characters even the ones with less than stellar personalities cersei beware of bad karma debts but i find the books tedious and predictable i wonder what might have been the outcome if hbo had made both the hobbit and lotr certainly we would have seen the inimitable tom bombadill that alone would be an improvement sarah i trust you enjoyed the episode on your tv last night i certainly did the second time through "
"299" "MrTreeMonkey" 2014-06-10 " loved it to have a sustained hour long battle was great from the moment the biggest bonfire the north had ever seen was lit the episode gathered pace the difference between this and the battle of blackwater which i also loved were that you were kinda rooting for stannis as joffrey was such a great bad guy whereas here you had sympathies for both sides and knew that not everyone was walking away from the battle it did initially bug me a little bit that all the named combatants kinda walked through the chaos in a bubble but then again most of the other fighters were scrappers at best whereas the likes of tormund alister thorne and the magnar were all skilled and experienced warriors who would best most unaccomplished fighters easily anyone who saw tormund or the magnur walking through a fight as well would be happy enough to leave them alone if they werent turning on them as they were both also fiercly big men alas poor pyp he died in a lot of pain at least grenn went out like a bad ass great episode i think there might be some big stuff next week as well i dont know how i will fill the time after this at least when the walking dead finished this started immediately afterwards "
"300" "crehane" 2014-06-10 " i think that this is actually part of the point although the point that is ultimately being made will be years in the making to be slightly less cryptic while the vast majority of the characters of got as well as us the viewers have been predominantly preoccupied with the politcs of the iron throne and who sits upon it the real issue and threat has gone largely unnoticed and ignored namely that winter is coming the white walkers have returned and that the wall and the nightswatch is the only thing holding them at bay "
"301" "James Minglis" 2014-06-10 " thats an overall criticism though to be bored by this episode just seems silly regardless complain however you might if you didnt care about the plight of the characters you have a heart like littlefingers "

"303" "RedByName" 2014-06-10 " i havent read the books part of me would like to part of me knows i hardly read books anyway these days and part of me likes the surprise when the big shocks play out in front of me unexpectedly so im not going to start now but as a consequence the vast cast is almost impossible to follow my wife commented last night that it would be interesting to see a breakdown of how much screen time each character has had and its true in 39 hours of television over 3 years and 3 months did grenn and pyps screentime even total 1 hour i felt very little empathy for characters who had appeared in fleeting glimpses for 3 or 4 minutes a week max and usually only as a character to whom jon or sam were talking "
"304" "James Minglis" 2014-06-10 " terrible comment cos no one cared whether bronn or varys or tyrion died or not no one wanted cersei and joffrey to get murdered there are brave men at that gate lets go kill them i think you both need to watch it again "
"305" "James Minglis" 2014-06-10 " all action no heart or real drama wut the action came with heart and drama you act like one cant exist without the other two kit might be one of the weaker actors but the other men at the nights watch are excellent "
"306" "James Minglis" 2014-06-10 " im not saying hes a great actor but you cant judge anyones acting by a paul ws anderson film even kiefer sutherland was bad in pompeii hilariously bad but still bad "

"308" "Nicetime" 2014-06-10 " well you just saw how assuming you watched the episode its a bit like the battle at thermopylae or indeed the battle of seelow heights east of berlin in 1945 a small well fortified force or a force holding a narrow strip og ground can do a lot of damage to a larger invading army "

"318" "DiegoLSmith" 2014-06-10 " i rather like jons northern gruffness im not a bleeding poet and the friendship with sam is beautifully drawn – but i never feel i care about him as much as i should hes a traditional romantic hero his motivations being absolutely castiron unwavering bravery and sense of duty but behind these is a deep well of feeling passion and capacity for love feminist theory has roundly deconstructed or rather trampled mercilessly into the cold hard ground the idea of traditional make heroes i think sh your own view is probably a reflection of this by contrast i think hes just totally bloody awesome because im a boy and my favourite the characters in the show are him and oberyn in fact after oberyns death the thought of jon being tortured to death by the wildlings is too much "
"319" "kjfunk" 2014-06-10 " id read that this episode was going to be fully focused on the wall and all and was a bit glum what about tyrion and arya and sansa and tyrion given that its not been very exciting up there but i found that it was pretty fab to concentrate on character development and fighting and that over a whole episode for once weve hardly touched on the development of so many characters this season as the storylines expand everoutwards and finally i cared about sam and jon and all those other ones with beards and grim expressions much cheering and sobbing etc makes me wonder whether db and dw shouldnt have done this a bit more over the season ive found it really bitty and havent cared as much about lots of the characters as i used to a whole episode devoted to the eyrie to arya and the hound maybe three or so to tyrion ps what the hells has happened about tommen marrying margery tywin agreed they should be married two weeks after joffreys death and cersei to loras a bit after that has this whole season only covered two weeks hhhmm "
"320" "WhereToCaptain" 2014-06-10 " incredible episode  but how did the rag tag bunch of nights watch hold their own at castle black against those massive thenns and crazed wildlings  surely they would have all been slaughtered in about 15 minutes "

"323" "dsk84" 2014-06-10 " i think to an extent to have a greater level of tension it had to be after the mountain vs the viper  that episode reinforced the somewhat unpredictable nature of the show after seeing oberyns skull crushed so brutally i suspect some fans who havent read the books would have been genuinely concerned about the outcome of the battle that tension may not have been as great earlier in the season and i feel it was probably correct otherwise i agree this episode could have been earlier and the mountain vs the viper in at episode 9 "
"324" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-10 " its bad acting though we should see her playing the figurehead yes but also see something real behind that "
"325" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-10 " oh i think there are other inadequate performances but her performance is one that perhaps needs to be very strong in a way she has to carry the bulk of that section of the story and i think it is probably a rather difficult role some of the other bad performances are less important characters or there is more action people are sick of the meereen storyline because they dont see the point in it part of that may be their expectations they want action and they think she is supposed to be in westeros  but i think it is also because they dont see much going on with dany "

"328" "crehane" 2014-06-10 " my reckoning also jon snow says hes heading out to kill mance but i reckon that his plan is to hand himself in  hes going to try and strike some sort or a deal with mance and if that doesnt work then hell try to kill him suicide mission style after all the nightswatch are now offically screwed they dont have the manpower or ability to hold back either mances wildlings or the white walkers i think its time to try and negotiate a deal of some sort or other "
"329" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-10 " now i thought her scene with jorah was awful i just thought there is a girl pretending to be all broken up but not show it i tend to think that the way they have translated the inner dialogue stuff is generally successful as long as people realize that not all the scenes are meant to feature an event some are just about character development i like character based stories generally so that works just fine for me i wonder if some of the difficulty with mereen is that a they have actually simplified the political intrigue a bit and b people do see it as marking time rather than somehow important in itself but we dont really know that is true the fact that we think conquering westeros is what danys story is all about might be a sort of misdirection i think the biggest failing with poor sansa was many people thought she was dumb but then lots of people in kings landing thought that as well "
"330" "dsk84" 2014-06-10 " yeah they wouldnt even have enough gear let alone the other logistics jon snow for example only had those spiky boots cause ygritte stole them off someone and over such a narrow corridor a 1000 people doesnt really help as the fighting area is still the same if the nights watch light up the attackers and get long spears that numerical advantage would be effectively negated "
"331" "torquemadascodpiece" 2014-06-10 " considering it took them 2 series for them to reach the wall in the first place the shows producers would have needed another 5 series to get the 100000 or so wildings over the wall "

"333" "pdianek" 2014-06-10 " the hobbit films are shite total travesties wouldnt go that far but peter jacksons penchant for juvenile kicks and cartoony scenes really let down the side in my opinion when dwarves are sledding through an enemys cave landing many stories down without a single broken bone or concussion  come on "
"334" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-06-10 " i had read before watching some headline that that someone found this episode disappointing i had low expectations and i agree the north and the wall have not had the build up some may have expected  then again who knows maybe that was the producers intention to all of a sudden switch things in a very large way an entire episode in one location is a big change from here things may gallop onwards with events focusing more firmly it is known maybe anyways i found myself thoroughly enjoying this episode the most of the series so far and cursing eating my diner watching it ive got one black eye and the wall is covered in mayonnaise and chips "
"335" "torquemadascodpiece" 2014-06-10 " just a thought but with the multiple storylines of characters and locations and their timelines i wonder if the got series would have benefitted from a different approach season 1 and 2 would have remained in its format to introduce the main characters and locations then have season 3 with 2 series spinoffs dedicated to the wall and branns story and to daenerys trek through the desert season 4 could have continued along with the two spinoffs great show though "
"336" "dsk84" 2014-06-10 " a case could have been put forward for ollie if it wasnt for him movement up and down would have been a much bigger challenge and he saved jon snow though the battle was pretty much over by then "

"338" "Dewulf" 2014-06-10 " which is great really cos who wants each season to fall into some predictable rut where we know everythings gonna build up to episode 9 no one gots big advantage over other shows is its unpredictability anyone can die etc they need to preserve that element in the flow of the season arc as well "

"343" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-06-10 " sorry yes that is what i mean but can you imagine if they didnt burn that giant in the tunnel and he turned or if they leave giantsbane for overnight for questioning and he died and turned there were a lot of dead bodies to deal with "
"344" "chriskilby" 2014-06-10 " yeah and fit kit harrington with contact lens actually yes hes certainly pofaced enough anyone but alan fucking davies basically not many people know thats his full name and of course theres only one man who could play middenface mcnulty with his broad scottish accent  aiden gillen i was thinking more john c reilly he wouldnt even need any makeup hows his glaswegian accent "

"347" "Dewulf" 2014-06-10 " but different stories within got need to have different length arcs the eventual onslaught of the winter is going to have the longest arc i would assume so its natural that it will take some time for that story to pick up pace even in the books but especially in the tv series you cant have too much happening at the same time so some stories will be given time and progress sparinglyits just good writing "

"351" "DiamondDag" 2014-06-10 " i just dont agree sorry emilia clarke has shown on numerous occasions shes up to the task when shes actually got a scene to act in im not going to pretend shes perfect but there are other actors in the show that give uneven performances but attract less attention for it shes not the one blemish in a perfect cast its frustrating to me because i know what she could be as a character at this point if they even tried to give her an ounce of depth there are so many ways they could humanise her on the show and they ignore all of them to present this unlovable queen daenerys and its pretty clear from a lot of comments that people are getting sick of the meereen story line already obviously conversations like this are a bit impossible when youre dancing around spoilers all the time anyway i respect your opinion bluegoat you always have insightful things to say about the show youre just wrong "

"357" "Dewulf" 2014-06-10 " thats an excellent point really  in world war z the israelis were still accepting refugees because every one we save is one less we have to fight and if they hadve kept the ruckus down that mightve actually helped them in the end mance has an army of 100000plus family members right imagine all of them converted to wights and the newborn sons to white walkers "

"360" "marktheowl" 2014-06-10 " i think that late development may be why many have a bit of a downer on jon  since going to the wall theres not really had the huge character defining moments of those further south ned and robbs deaths for example lacked the impact on him that they did on the other starks as they essentially changed nothing for him  as did pretty much everything that happened to him on the wall he toughened up a bit and made some friends but its little compared to what arya sansa tyrion and jaime have had to cope with even his going off with the wildlings and ygritte storyline essentially ended up with him back where he started but a tad wiser wisdom he couldnt use until alissers demise thinking about it sam has had far more character progression gilly and baby whitewalker death than jon that and the fact that in a cast of interesting tv actors  kit harrington is more or less the only one who looks like a bland blockbuster leading man playing a relatively traditional hero thats no disparagement meant to him hes pretty good at it  but in a show where much of the appeal is hitherto overlooked character actors hamming it up between drastic plot twists his rather traditional boy becomes man story has felt a tad bland up until now hopefully now hes the one making the life or death decisions well get to like jon more  it may even be that his relatively sedate first few seasons has been to set him up for great things later on "

"370" "Clariana" 2014-06-10 " yeah but the point is wildings dont do kings or nobility they are wild anarquists loosely tribal and happy as they are they call those south of the wall kneelers yes mance managed to unite them to an extent there are some who still refuse to play ball but that is under the duress of ww and only then they have formed some sort of very loose federation having said that nothing binds like a common enemy those with good heads in both the nw and the wildings might well come to realise that "

"372" "steve3742" 2014-06-10 " agree completely the episode is good although i dont like where they decided to end it but the season preceding it has been terrible wallwise and this affects the way the episode feels "
"373" "Clariana" 2014-06-10 " but to an extent dany is a doll she has to be a figurehead the perfect a silent woman first of all when she is literally sold by her brother to kahl drogo as such and then as kahleesi where she generally has to remain silent and be stoic and finally as queen and warleader where she cannot allow herself to show emotions least they be taken as weaknesses in fact in the book she often tells herself things like a queen does not cry if you see emilia as herself she is actually a pretty nervy smiley type of lady the rigidness lack of emotions is actually acting "
"374" "steve3742" 2014-06-10 " as much as i enjoy the shennanigans in kings landing the advance of the wildling army has been sign posted since season 2 thats kind of the point the wildlings have been marching on the wall for over a year now real time not tv time and i dont think im the only one whos got a bit bored of it in the books its paced a little better  they start marching at the end of book 2 and get there near the end of book 3 but splitting it across 2 seasons made it difficult plus they cut some of the wall stuff out the battle at the fist of the first men and the long retreat from there would have been great and did all the really significant stuff last season the result has been that this season weve hardly had any references to the wall and its all been filler those of us whod read the books knew it was building to a huge episode 9 battle but it must have been obvious to others that the wall scenes were filler and that they were building up to something campare with blackwater season 2 built its way towards that in every episode giving a satisfactory climax in ep 9 and then an aftermath episode as always here theres been no build up just filler as the slowest army in the world advances on its target  and then they didnt even finish it dragging the conclusion over into next episode where its going to have to compete for space with lots of other things tyrions appointment with the axe bran and rickon arya and the hound and probably a few other storylines which is a pity because its a good conclusion and it would have fitted well as the end of this episode cliffhangers dont work to well when you know whats coming still next weeks episode should be good lots of stuff worth watching "

"390" "PrincipalOfTheLine" 2014-06-10 " i think the whole point of having thoren wounded but not dead and slynt cowering the corner was to allow jon to take on the role of de facto head of the nights watch thoren thorne one letter out of place and im caught somewhere between westeros and middle earth  "
"391" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-10 " the episode didnt disappoint me as such i just think it should have come earlier in the season basically my issue is that they havent spent enough time on the wall prior to this i think it was brilliantly directed a great spectacle and had some lovely quieter moments but i also think that we would have had more of a sense of what was at stake if they hadnt put the wall on the backburner for much of the season that doesnt mean i hated the episode i really didnt but ive loved others more "

"393" "Timmojohn" 2014-06-10 " so does anyone know the answer to this puzzle i am confused is castle black on the north or south side of the wall because it seems strange that they were fighting in the castle walls yet they had not penetrated the wall the furthest they got was when the giant got killed under the gate so where was all that fighting going on and how did they get into that part i thought that was on the other side of the wall unless they went through a tunnel but then why didnt they all come in the same way "

"398" "johnnyG79" 2014-06-10 " the real shocker for me arrived about twenty minutes in when it began to dawn on me that the whole episode would be devoted to this tedious procession of wall climbing and gate bashing some great hand to hand fighting but in got we have seen death and are no longer shocked by violence there was a tracking shot of the various vicious skirmishes taking place that was jaw dropping and the tension was palpable as the scale of the onslaught became apparent a giant riding a mammoth will always be good to watch tooigrettes death scene was very sad and suspenseful too cos i thought joner was a goner for a minute in spite of the few scenes that were simply stunning i was expecting a whopper from start to finish like the ninth episodes in the previous seasons but i didnt get it and next week i think there are too many strands to tie up satisfactorily and they will leave us hanging on for a year wanting to be back in fantastic mind blowing westeros once more "

"473" "Fathermcree" 2014-06-10 " they have to attack there as there is a gate through the wall that they can all get throughits the only one hence you have the nights watch guarding that particular spot "
"474" "Mirthin" 2014-06-10 " i dont really buy that the show had already commanded big budgets and big ratings by the start of season 3 and there werent really any big showstopper spectacles in that season zombie effects are not that hard or expensive to do thats why there are so many lowbudget student zombie movies the battle at the fist took place at night in the darkness in a camp in a natural setting so the sets could have been minimal im not saying they needed to devote a whole episode to it 5 minutes probably would have been sufficient the whole thing could have been done for probably a fraction of the cost of a single dragon shot "

"477" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-06-10 " youve missed the point of wildlings nature they call themselves the free folk instead of wildlings and refer to those south of the wall as kneelers the point being they are tribes who refuse to bend the knee and submit to the feudal system some of them are just individuals like craster who dont belong to any group they prefer to live free north of the wall than as servants to some lord down south mance is not really a king at all  hes their leader but they dont serve him and can come and go as they wish "

"481" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-06-10 " i think there are a couple of things that need to be considered from jons perspective i have no doubt that he was lying to sam and he is going to mance to broker some sort of truce the reason for this is twofold firstly he knows the watch cannot hold up agaisnt repeated assaults from mances army there numbers are too few and their defences are already close to being breached secondly jon is the only man on the watch side who has seen the wildlings up close he knows they are not an invading force but they are essentailly refugees fleeing extermination at the hands of the white walkers he seems to be the only one who is aware of the bigger picture and sees what is at stake the more wildlings they kill the more bodies the leave for the whitewalkers i quite liked the scene where a cornered and feathered thornmund was goading him into finishing him off and perhaps taking out another 1 or 2 crows in the process jon puts a bolt in his leg and has him hauled away he may need thormund to help him broker a peace with mance hes making decisions as thorne pointed out atop the wall a bad decision is better than no decision at all "

"484" "guardiansek" 2014-06-10 " i know enough about the content of the 4th book to know that some events from that book have been brought forward for example i believe the whole capture of moat cailin sp and ramsays and reeks arrival at winterfell is part of the 4th book so i guess it is possible that some items from book three might be pushed into next season if it makes sense for the show "

"496" "Pacifyx" 2014-06-10 " no but they could of easily gotten a few thousand over the wall a few kms from castle black then easily stormed the place from the other side one part of the story i never really thought made any sense it was shown that they are quite capable of scaling the wall so why not sending a much larger raiding force over to open the gates from the other side "
"497" "Pacifyx" 2014-06-10 " man i still cant believe they killed grenn and pyp  suppose they were trying to save money by killing off a couple of minor characters still they were 2 of the best characters at the wall other than edd  "

"515" "Dewulf" 2014-06-10 " i thought the same  and i just wonder to what degree they choreographed the action for that shot can you imagine coordinating specific blowsstrikesfallsdeaths across multiple combatants in time with the sweep of the camera even more impressive if so "

"518" "NiruKarogu" 2014-06-10 " but that hollywood cliche death scene undermined the dramatic tension for me he holds her as shes dying for those last words as the sound mutes all around and none of the fighting intrudes but remains in a soft focus background blech if only the nights watch thought to stage romantic moments in front of the wall the wildlings would be kept at bay attention drifting elsewhere due to the strong odour of cheesy amour "

"525" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-10 " i think the problem with dany might not be the writing but the actress this actually come home to me when i was watching the scene with melisandre in the bath and stannis we shes not a major character but we can see so much about her how she felt about that situation her own inner conflicts and fears just from her acting and lysa was another good example yes she had some great crazy lines but it was really her face and body that told us story about her with dany she just seems blank to me like a sort of doll even in her most emotional scenes "

"532" "James Minglis" 2014-06-10 " oh you didnt "
"533" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-10 " well they have their good points but they arent all sweetness and light poor old shireen wouldnt exist if shes been a wildling theyd have exposed her im not sure if people picked up on it but bran mentined on his journey to meera and jojen that people used to live and farm the lands around the wall but they moved further south because of raids from wildlings so it isnt as if there is oppression just in one direction it sometimes seems like the wildlings want the fruits of civilization but they dont want the social organization that allows for it and maybe some of them are willing to take the fruits by force i wonder if that is so different than the way the nobility and the strong and wealthy behave in the rest of westeros but i would say the sense in which the land belongs to regular people and is taken from them is a reoccurring theme in the story  we see a lot of it for example with arya and the hounds journey and in the slave cities as well "
"534" "Mmmrrrggglll" 2014-06-10 " well if we are going to be historical about it then that kind of supports my view wouldnt they just be part of the north imagine how powerful a king in the north would be with a few 100000 extra men and some giants "
"535" "James Minglis" 2014-06-10 " agreed that they really have dropped the ball with the wall storyline i dont think any of the friends i watched it with understood the immensity of the fucked the wall is supposed to be at this point but the execution was definitely great and come on the thing with ygritte was cheesy as fuck im okay with it still but when we saw that kid we all cracked up "
"536" "Mmmrrrggglll" 2014-06-10 " theyve spent a few episodes murdering innocent people indiscriminately and some are into cannibalism surely its not hard to see why people might want them kept out well the bolotons  whom currently represent the leadership of the north  are into live flaying and any number of other horrific practice i suspect the wildings might represent a step up in civilisation "

"575" "meliflaw" 2014-06-10 " by the way i dont mean that harington and clarke were hired on looks alone as theyre both pretty capable performers but its always seemed difficult for most screenwriters to write for gorgeous young things almost as if their looks alone counted as an automatic virtue or characteristic hence for example beautiful 20something female doctors who dont sound as if theyve spent an hour in er however many medical terms they sling around "
"576" "False09" 2014-06-10 " some jaw dropping moments this episode one not mentioned was the archers hanging over the edge of the cliff firing arrows at wildlings scaling the wall "
"577" "AnnM1997" 2014-06-10 " i completely agree with sarah i have read the books and the wall was by far my favourite section and jon snow  my favourite character  i watch with my sister and each week i would say  no wall or  minuscule snippet of the wall and she would call it wall watch the lack of focus in this series has diluted the effect of this episodes emotional impact that said  i thought it was beautifully done and very well realised i felt tense throughout and sam was brilliant i felt jon didnt bring his sword or ghost because he went to meet mance with zero hope an incredibly downbeat end and i liked that how often do men fight bravely die honourably and for it to be for nothing and i appreciated that we are left with that rather than an uplifting hurrah we are all saved at the end of the episode not wanting to spoil i think it will make sense by season endi really dont give the writers credit that that the lack of wall was intentional it match us to westorosi not caring these are the people that didnt even watch or get the cerseijamie crypt scene "
"578" "Kelley Mickey" 2014-06-09 " true enough but the way some of these adventurers travel hell never find any of them "
"579" "DiamondDag" 2014-06-09 " id agree with that blackwater had the benefit of more scope for drama but it seems like theyd learnt things about staging an episode of this scale and made it all flow better "
"580" "davidjones2492" 2014-06-09 " to be fair it shouldnt take jon long to find mance hes only a few hundred yards away surrounded by hundreds of thousands of wildlings "
"581" "Aelfwine" 2014-06-09 " i’d also say we could leave the storylines for sansalittlefinger yarairon islanders briennepoderick ramsayroose boltonpoor reek and the nowexiled jorah where they were when we last saw them but we may see more on some of them as well with the exception of brienne and pod i feel this may be the case reeks and especially sansas last scenes looked like they were tying up this seasons storylines not having them in the finale makes perfect sense especially considering how crowded that episode will probably be anyway but i still feel a bit sad at the thought of not seeing either of them for almost a year "
"582" "St1bs" 2014-06-09 " jon dany and i happen to subscribe to the tyrion theory there are of course a legion of theories so im probably wrong "

"586" "EnglishDisco" 2014-06-09 " my point is that even in the book you lose interest in certain story lines until you get a paragraph or two into someones pov and it reminds you of the importance as much as i missed the battle at the fist in the show  i think that it could have been handled terribly and the producers probably knew that knowing the limitations of their budget and cgi etc i think they did a good job with that "
"587" "Clariana" 2014-06-09 " and of course north of the wall we have the white walkers who were introduced in the prelude to episode one season one they are so laid back about their conquest of westeros that they make manse rayder’s glacial har har advance look like the indy 500 its hard to get too worked up about the danger they present to westeros when they seem to be happy to sit on their butts between perpetrating scattered smallish massacres north of the wall well we now know that the ww are sentient and intelligent perhaps there is good reason for their delay after all why wade in and destroy humanity when humanity itself can do the job for you given a little time "

"592" "davidjones2492" 2014-06-09 " harsh on poor old snow the reason why sam and all the younger nights watchers love jon is that he stood up for them from the minute they arrived at the wall sam would probably have died without jons protection he effectively trained gren and pyp and went out of his way to help them that was why mormont identified him as a future leader in the early episodes jons story has been about a naive kid becoming a leader similar to sansas story but with more fighting clearly he stepped up to defend the wall in this episode "
"593" "St1bs" 2014-06-09 " me too it was the one part of the book that made me cry i cry a bit too easily jon is virtually hysterical in the books well get the arrow out  youre gonna live kinda thing so she really does mean it when she says you know nothing jon snow "
"594" "Simgeo" 2014-06-09 " i assume that cook must be the seldomseen hobb id be avoiding his mutton stew for a while "
"595" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-09 " i thought this episode was very nice i really enjoyed seeing a different side of ser allister and i think sam is really coming into his own as a very interesting and bright character with a lot of depth and there was a significant sense of them all being there and it being kind of hopeless and isolated from the rest of what is going on in westeros as far as this even as i appreciated the realism behind that downbeat ending it was hard not to feel a sense of anticlimax whats the point in throwing half a tonne of cgi effects at an episode if it doesnt lead to some sort of conclusion i think that we should not look at it as if it has left something unfinished other than in the sense that time marches on endlessly the idea that they can stop the wildlings with military force without something happening seems to have been put to bed jon thinks there has to be another way and i cant see how we can disagree so perhaps what we are finding is as we commonly see on got it isnt just or even mostly pure martial or physical prowess that will accomplish important things that is true for the people at the wall but really we know it is true for the wildlings as well if they get across they have not really won much they still need to head further south where they face a different kind of army where the population is large and organized where they dont know the land and the white walkers will still be behind them "
"596" "Kelley Mickey" 2014-06-09 " yes that was brans best scene "
"597" "Aelfwine" 2014-06-09 " might be a bit incestuous though if the theories are to be believed not that it would stop proper targaryens "

"599" "luciadelondres" 2014-06-09 " big wall big mammoths seen that somewhere before kept expecting the blond elf to turn up "
"600" "Clariana" 2014-06-09 " there have and some of them were a little on the dark side "
"601" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-06-09 " yep intentionally i expect a first for the series a whole episode in one place "
"602" "Kelley Mickey" 2014-06-09 " i dont understand why the wildlings kill everybody they see south of the wall sure they want the land back that was taken from them how many years ago thousands it it looks like to me they might try to recruit some of the folks they meet some of them are bound to have many of the wildlings same grievances terror tactics can work but do the armies of the westeros lords really care that much who the wildlings kill its a shame well have to wait nearly a year to find any answers somehow thats just not right "
"603" "WharfedaleTiger" 2014-06-09 " indeed  much like tolken the action scenes are some of the weakest parts of the book and it does tend to steer clear of them  few of the big battles happen on page eg robs campaigns martins strengths are character plot and world building not writing the characters and world hes created are fascinating and diverse  often to the extent that the plot gets sidelined to deal with character and world building see feast of crows and to a lesser extent a dance with dragons those are things which the tv show has generally done well to get across but it has failed to do this at the wall  its just too slow and stretched across too many chapters i also think that kit harrington is a fine actor but hasnt been able to convey jons internal development its ominous for the next season when things slow down and become really characterworld buildy "
"604" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-06-09 " you have to assume he is going to make a deal given he leaves his sword and wolf behind "
"605" "Clariana" 2014-06-09 " he does by all accounts pompeii was horrible but perhaps it gave him the umph he needed when he got out of the lift and started across the courtyard he was awesome even putting the arrow in tormunds leg "
"606" "Greenseer" 2014-06-09 " im a book reader too and i loved it  "
"607" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-06-09 " yes it lacked super elves and dwarves with rather unrealistic looking noses as well as a tennis style tally sideline im a huge lotr fan but grrm does characters much better than tolkien and whilst tv limits his great ability with that this episode still had more character and heart than the lotr battles i feel a lot of different characters got their moments amidst the long battle "
"608" "AnnM1997" 2014-06-09 " yes and ygrittes camp just over a hill they were the worst watchmen ever "
"609" "penny0604" 2014-06-09 " i hope thats right it would be a smart way of handling it but from a viewers perspective and it is still a tv show it makes you care a bit less i think the other thing is that blackwater was relatively early on and the bar has been set so consistently high its harder to impress these daysit still beats any other show by a mile "
"610" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-06-09 " well i think despite her bravado certain looks in her eyes showed she knew shed be uncertain about taking snow out well for a curry and a movie yeah but not out out "
"611" "Greenseer" 2014-06-09 " well donals role fell to grenn on the show so  same result in the endi do know what you mean about the wall and its something ive wanted to comment on for a while now i happen to love the wall storyline but i dont think its been given its due in the show lets face it since season 2 the show has become extremely tyrioncentric we all love dinklage but i do feel the showrunners are blatantly setting tyrion up to be the main character in this whole thing when you think that there are in fact in the books three major characters jon dany and tyrion i really dont think the trio get equal quality of storyline add to this stannis he really has been sidelined to a degree which causes me some quiet outrage why cast an actor of dillanes calibre only to waste him really dd you dont deserve him although i have my hopes for the finale on that score danys scenes have been on a steady decline since season 1 yes some of this is due to the source material itself but she was a favourite character of mine and now her scenes have become only bearable if theres a dragon involved thats a sad place to be for a diehard targ like me thats why i was pleased with the little missandeigrey worm development last week  at least it was something to watch and cheer for having said all this i did enjoy tonights episode  i thought it was suitably epic and i personally loved the last scenes between ygritte and jon i have been far more invested in their romance on the show than i was in the books hollywoodesque it may be but rose sold it all the way through i adored grenn too and shall miss him "
"612" "DidoTwite" 2014-06-09 " i loved loved loved the griefstricken giant tearing down the gate with his bare hands and the burning mammoth dragging that wildling away on a rope and the massive scythe taking the wildlings down midclimb and that thenn getting a hammer through the skull super episode i thought miles better than the blackwater as for grenn holding the gate for jon sob and pyp making his first kill double sob  for me they were horrible surprises but they make total sense from the shows point of view as theres no donal nye to root for in the tunnel jons my favourite in the books and yes i always find his storylines a bit disappointing on the show but that little weary halfsmile when ygritte appeared arrow in hand  loved it i thought it was beautifully acted very touching i understand people get bored of jon but after the red viper  mountain stuff last week for me it just made a nice change to see characters being decent and heroic "
"613" "davidjones2492" 2014-06-09 " aemon is about 30 or 40 years older than olenna though so its probably not her hes going on about "
"614" "OrpheusLiar" 2014-06-09 " best performance yet from kit really looks to be growing into the role "
"615" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-06-09 " yessir "
"616" "Wrennie" 2014-06-09 " surely jon snow has to conquer danaerys if you catch my drift might be a bit incestuous though if the theories are to be believed "
"617" "davidjones2492" 2014-06-09 " the watch has 3 functional castles castle black is the one in the middle but there are 2 further ones on each end of the wall the other castles are more fully manned due to losing fewer men during the ranging "
"618" "twoandahalfribs" 2014-06-09 " i agree with this and think its quite clever of them  but perhaps theyve overdone it a little i didnt even remember who grenn was it was so long since id seen him so the emotional impact of him holding the gate and chanting the vows was somewhat though not totally lost "
"619" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-06-09 " im not sure but the population of the nights watch once at 100 may be in overdraft after that episode "
"620" "Bluegoat" 2014-06-09 " i think you may not be far off in your analysis in general when i see complaints that are about what is going on in the show as far as what is written it seems that people want more action they want to see something tangible happen but the source material despite being in a sense quite heavily and intricately plotted is very much character driven or i might almost say thematically driven its not really actiondriven in any case despite having some exciting parts with the narrative voice characters it tends to be their experience of the action that acts as a mediator between the setting and the viewer and they sometimes seem to struggle to get that across "
"621" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-06-09 " yeah "
"622" "DidoTwite" 2014-06-09 " well spotted "
"623" "WharfedaleTiger" 2014-06-09 " yeah but did it ever feel like he might die from those wounds not really too much narrative armour "
"624" "PlumRadio" 2014-06-09 " hes the kid who killed ygritte right well she did take part in the massacre of his family so i dont have a problem with this "
"625" "Thulcandra" 2014-06-09 " i loved this episode but it rather felt as if i were watching a different show i think sarah nailed the reasons why the story on the wall is so different to whats going on in the rest of westeros and essos and the stakes are so much higher that every visit to the wall feels jarring and it needs stand alone episodes like this to bring you back into the heart of the most important action in the seven kingdoms no kit harrington isnt the best actor ever not even the best actor at the wall but he did jon justice in this ep and he was surrounded by some superb support from john bradley owen teal and the always heart wrenching peter vaughn my only slight criticism was the ending this episode ran short again a bad habit picked up this season there is so much story to tell and so much from the end of book 3 that is presumably going to be squashed into the final episode that i think this ep could have benefited from an extended blackwaterstyle 90 mins so to tie up this story and give more room in ep 10 for boat rides gastric troubles and stony stony hearts  "
"626" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-06-09 " roger that was a surprisingly good episode however and all in one place the entire time i cheered ser alister cried like a baby for ygritte and got sams a baller tattoo all unexpected the ending was a bit odd though where was his wolf and snow didnt seem to have a sword "
"627" "eyedropper" 2014-06-09 " you didnt like giants riding mammoths trying to break through the gate "
"628" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2014-06-09 " he was the best archer in his hamlet "
"629" "eyedropper" 2014-06-09 " he did get shot a couple of times by ygritte though which he seemed to recovered from quickly while tyrons face slash took ages "
"630" "PlumRadio" 2014-06-09 " go check my link the post before yours for details on the filming of it "
"631" "PlainJoeSmith" 2014-06-09 " after that sams virginity went from technical to nonexistent "

"633" "baldynapper" 2014-06-09 " dont worry its not an infection that does it the lannisters take off and nuke the entire vale from orbit it was the only way to be sure "
"634" "WharfedaleTiger" 2014-06-09 " on the episode itself it felt a bit like the golden compass film to me  each individual element and scene was great but it just didnt hang together it lacked a narrative climax and im surprised they dropped parts of what will happen from the end i also didnt like the change with ygrette but i understand why it was made its a big turning point for jon and should be an emotional moment which it was and i dont think the doubt over who killed her and jons guilt would have worked on tv "
"635" "PlumRadio" 2014-06-09 " imagine king aemon and queen olenna if only the seven kingdoms would be have been at peace for decades but we wouldnt have got sam could be a great and wise maester one day no "

"638" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-06-09 " loved that scene in lotr and yes not as slick or epic however for me it had more character emotion and no elves surfing shields across orcs firing unmissable arrows "
"639" "timincognito" 2014-06-09 " yeah i noticed that too i couldnt help but feel impressed at the time and still now as that truly was a beautiful shot "
"640" "Beetlegeuce" 2014-06-09 " i love the show and this was a fantastic episode but there are just too many significant deathsit is bound by the source material they plough through characters at an enormous rate meaning that it lessons the impact when a significant character dies im looking forward to see how it finishes next week though as an unsullied non book reader they best not kill the hound off with a fucking infection "
"641" "Birneybau1" 2014-06-09 " ygritte was killed by that shes tangfastic kid shows how hard she really was "
"642" "PlumRadio" 2014-06-09 " yeah theres never enough caesar  i mean mance  "
"643" "WharfedaleTiger" 2014-06-09 " to add a quick appendium because of all this jon has essentally become superman and a classic hero this means that there is no danger in his storyline  hes never in danger and thus tension never buildings "
"644" "caroline457" 2014-06-09 " his uncle benjen was first ranger leader of the rangers rather than lord commander leader of the whole watch i think your point is very worthwhile though and im sure there have been stark lord commanders "
"645" "WharfedaleTiger" 2014-06-09 " not a bad episode but not a great one either  a shame considering how well done the episode was and how much i love the nights watch storyline in the book the problem with the nights watch parts is twofold a the way the story has been told and b jon a the storyline has been difficult for the past 3 seasons in the books its quite slow to unfold and contains a lot of character moments you learn about the wildlings jon almost goes native and theres a lot of building of character in the series this slow burn has to be compressed into action  thus we learn less about the wildlings history of culture jons relationship with halfhand and the other characters is stunted and a lot of his key character moments lose their impact this is necessary for tv of course or wed have a jon scene an episode which would consist of him chatting to people people already found that his storyline lacked action and thought they were boring  hence the shoehorning of action into it b all this leads me onto jon himself hes is probably the hardest major character to translate across  he simply doesnt express himself like most of the others jon is quiet introspective emotional and intelligent but hes not flashy he doesnt quip like tyrion and much of his storyline is about growing up and developing because of this hes the character who is most harmed by the aging up process in the book hes very young and he grows  he loses his idealism deals with his anger about being a bastard falls in love for the first time and is exposed to a different culture this hardening and in some ways softening process makes him the character who can achieve what he does in the later books  hes open to the wildlings as a people and doesnt view them sterotypically like some of the others at the same time ygrettes death and the possibility he kills her breaks him and makes him into person who can make hard unemotional decisions hes essentially buried that side of himself of course this hasnt really been portrayed at all in the tv series as i said before the couldnt really do it  how do you translate that sort of emotional journey with a quiet introspective character without huge amounts of pretty quiet tv in an action packed show "
"646" "Jonnytheshirt" 2014-06-09 " wheres the pathos they should have stayed in the cave but instead became what their lot in westeros made them poor snowmeo and gingerette "
"647" "caroline457" 2014-06-09 " i second sarahs comment above but i would actually add that i buy into jon in the books a lot more at least in part because the story of the wall is less neglected in my perception i would personally have liked to see a little more ingenuity from jon in this episode tactically speaking to buy into him as a leader and more than a pretty sulky boy "
"648" "Clariana" 2014-06-09 " i was dreading this too im much more of a palatial intrigue city person but jon snow was stoic and awesome and who didnt enjoy the giants giants "
"649" "aj2014" 2014-06-09 " a great episodeloved it "
"650" "splazsh" 2014-06-09 " this episode was very well done but rather dull in the end it just wasnt exciting enough to hold an entire episode the blackwater episode was much much better "
"651" "PlumRadio" 2014-06-09 " there was a lot of lotr the movies in that battle scene the only things missing were pointy ears on some of the fighters "
"652" "MrMsyvc" 2014-06-09 " yeah saw that brilliant "
"653" "Olly" 2014-06-09 " giants giant arrows very cool "

"656" "Clariana" 2014-06-09 " i said above that was something i could very easily see ned stark doing nature or nuture who knows "
"657" "IntravenousDeMilo" 2014-06-09 " i agree with everything there the surviving stark cubs have all developed hugely throughout the four series aryas development was the quickest probably because out the three of them she was the surest about herself and her desired place in the world but last week we saw the signs of development regarding sansa and now jon snow is becoming a leader of many men rather than just his small gang of mates in the watch it will be intriguing where they all go from here "
"658" "hexatu" 2014-06-09 " well that would make perfect sense wasnt he doesnt really resolve the problem inworld though to be honest i was expecting him to be a major figure like tywin since he first appeared "

"660" "hexatu" 2014-06-09 " no im not im happy enough following the tv series for now i like the fact you can imagine the plots spanning out over literally years and then you have these abrupt events deaths that cut some of those short i just agree that this episode felt like it should have come earlier "
"661" "Clariana" 2014-06-09 " horrible thought and the bloody wc starts on thursday grim "
"662" "Clariana" 2014-06-09 " no grenn was the hero of this episode for pulling that fast one to get rid of slynt and then rallying his small squad and dying in the successful attempt to stop the gate being breached "
"663" "Clariana" 2014-06-09 " exactly these are not happy times for the north "
"664" "Clariana" 2014-06-09 " the wildings are the barbarian invaders goths visigoths angles saxons the white walkers are the huns the mongolian hoard so yes some accommodation with the wildings might be possible even desirable "

"666" "Aelfwine" 2014-06-09 " i was dreading the thought of a wallonly episode but i ended up rather enjoying it yes it was very helms deepey but thats perfectly fine by me kit harrington was alright hell probably never be my favourite actor but hes definitely improved between season 3 and 4 sam  john bradley was lovely and i really liked the prebattle moments with him i wasnt quite as moved by ygrittes death as i expected to be though it felt a bit rushed and wed barely spent any time with her this season maybe on rewatch i really loved grenns last moment though  touching yet rousing stuff im surprised it ended that early the finale really will have a lot to cover maybe too much ah well im still bloody excited "
"667" "eyedropper" 2014-06-09 " anyone any idea where gendry is "
"668" "luciadelondres" 2014-06-09 " i found this episode incredibly tedious the only thing that could have made it more tedious in fact is if theyd shoehorned in a few scenes with bran who has not done anything remotely interesting since being booted out of the window in the first episode and of course that wasnt something that involved his active participation "
"669" "guardiansek" 2014-06-09 " i agree with sarah that the night’s watch story line is the consistently least engaging of the major storylines in got i also agree that a major problem with the story line is kit harrington’s performance and the general characterization of jon snow there is another problem with the night’s watch story line though—it takes freakin’ forever for anything to happen north of the wall we’ve known for 2 and  seasons that manse rayder has managed to gather the wildlings into an army set on overrunning the wall and moving south only now do we get an episode dedicated to their assault on the wall and it turns out to be dedicated to manse’s initial probe of the wall’s defenses by comparison it took two seasons for robb stark to gather his army move south to a series of initial victories find love and get married spar with his mother and bannermen over the future course of the war and for him and the north’s army to be betrayed and tragically destroyed it took one season for us to be introduced to stannis baratheon and his advisors for him to bribe and murder his way to control over his forces unsuccessfully assault king’s landing and following that loss for him to envision a way forward to ultimate victory and of course north of the wall we have the white walkers who were introduced in the prelude to episode one season one they are so laid back about their conquest of westeros that they make manse rayder’s glacial har har advance look like the indy 500 its hard to get too worked up about the danger they present to westeros when they seem to be happy to sit on their butts between perpetrating scattered smallish massacres north of the wall on top of which we know the night’s watch knows that the white walkers can be defeated by fire and obsidian projectiles—both of which can be used to great effect from the top of a 700 foot high wall as a concept the night’s watch is an engaging construct a onceglorious now ragtag group of extraneous noble sons exiles and criminals protecting the boundaries of civilization against a protracted wildling insurgency and the supernatural the execution is not equal to the concept in short this was a decent but not great episode i’ll miss grenn who won my attention with his season 3 soliloquy about how the fabled duties of the night’s watch mostly involve shoveling shit and ygritte—farewell and don’t forget to grab your “i died on game of thrones” tshirt on the way out however if you want to watch a much better episode covering a battle go back to season two and watch the masterful “blackwater” again and because we didn’t resolve the night’s watch vs wildling horde rumble this week next week we get to see more of that plus we need arya and the hound to figure out where they go next some kind of resolution or internecine king’s landinglannisteronlannister strife over tyrion’s death sentence where hodor is carting brandon off to and figure out where stannis and his new braavosifunded offensive are going plus we haven’t seen anything of osha and rickon all season long surely we are going to get an update on them i’d say that purely from a story standpoint we could leave danaerius and company where they were at after exiling jorah but the teaser for next week shows her and her dragons so we get to see something going on in mereen i’d also say we could leave the storylines for sansalittlefinger yarairon islanders briennepoderick ramsayroose boltonpoor reek and the nowexiled jorah where they were when we last saw them but we may see more on some of them as well seems like an awful lot for one week i’m writing hbo to demand an 11th episode this year "
"670" "baldynapper" 2014-06-09 " personally favourite line of the episode for me was pyp open the fucking gate enjoyed most of sams stuff in this episode actually even if the sam  gilly stuff was laid on a little thicksad to see pyp and grenn gone from jons band of brothers thankfully well still have edd and his never flagging optimism for at least another episode "
"671" "HashRouge" 2014-06-09 " i definitely agree with sarah about the way the wall scenes have been handled this season i feel like weve become disengaged from the wall and the characters there probably as a result of not spending very much time with them at all in this respect i wonder whether offing both pyp and grenn was something of a mistake given that they are two of the very few named and easily identifiable characters at the wall now there are even fewer characters at the wall for us to care about i dont really understand why the wall has been so overlooked this season when dany has been given scenes in more or less every episode even though most of the time all she has done is sit on her throne and harp on about being the mother of dragonsmore or less irrelevant now but i do wish they hadnt missed donal noye out of the show "

"675" "baldynapper" 2014-06-09 " do wonder if brazenly walking out of the gate and the watch shutting it again behind him might kind of give the game away though "
"676" "kged" 2014-06-09 " what are the wildlings actually after are they basically after refuge from the white walkers and all the supernatural stuff north of the wall yes essentially youll have picked up on the occasional aside about taking back what they consider to be their lands anyway before the watch put the wall up long memories these wildlings but thats a side issue the simple fact is they are running for their lives even some brothers of the watch are sceptical about all the supernatural stuff north of the wall and that gets more entrenched the further south you go until the folk of kings landing will openly laugh at talk of snarks and grumpkins but the wildlings know from direct experience that very very bad things indeed are heading south and theyre doing all they can to stay ahead of them "
"677" "Drgonzo123" 2014-06-09 " eeyore with a sword brilliant "
"678" "Robot3021" 2014-06-09 " god i hate sam and gilly "
"679" "eyedropper" 2014-06-09 " yeah i forget how did they get through "
"680" "DrGiggles" 2014-06-09 " how would we tell the difference "
"681" "eyedropper" 2014-06-09 " hes eeyore with a sword i was at school with eddben that really made me giggle "
"682" "Clariana" 2014-06-09 " i thought jon snow was great but his battle intervention was too short and he reminded me of eddard stark both in manner and in speech so that was good "
"683" "eyedropper" 2014-06-09 " could there be a white walker giant "
"684" "MightyMightyMan" 2014-06-09 " pffft when i was at twall they would cut me open fill me with coal and i had to work 18 hours cleaning all the horses from tinside until bedtime where slept impaled on a portcullis where i would be awoken 5 minutes later and set on fire and that was just me birthday "
"685" "eyedropper" 2014-06-09 " for all the fight talk i rather enjoyed the scene between sam and maester aemon "
"686" "eyedropper" 2014-06-09 " yet it was the liftelevator boy that took up a bow and killed ygritte "
"687" "TheNorthRemembers" 2014-06-09 " a lot of time and footage wasted on confused scufffles between nearidentical looking men and a woman in enclosed confused surroundings a lot of waffle too between jon and sam about sex between ygritte and the wildings about killing jon between sam and gilly about nothing much altogether too much sam in fact  the really interesting thing about the far north and the wall is of course the white walkers and they have been put on hold for far too long all in all and i hate to say this probably the weakest episode of the entire 4part series to date i agree about too much sam  hes really not that interesting albeit hes rather a jokey character the white walkers  are there more than two  are used far too sparingly "
"688" "Mirthin" 2014-06-09 " i saw the seams in the battle of blackwater it was very obvious where they didnt have the time or the budget to fully realise the battle this episode was much more impressive in terms of scale of achievement i cant fault the production and i have to say i was impressed with how well theyve pulled it off still blackwater had the better setup with more interesting characters at the center tyrion cersei geoffrey sansa the hound lancel so that episode naturally had more dramatic flourish "
"689" "Clariana" 2014-06-09 " i actually quite liked her she died fighting for what she believed in "
"690" "Empedokles" 2014-06-09 " good grief youre absolutely right all along ive been racking my brains to understand why on earth they opted to cast jon snow as an utterly unconvincing wimpy adolescent and the answer was obvious  of course its because hes the juvenile lead all is finally explained and hollywood rules apply "
"691" "DrGiggles" 2014-06-09 " ah they fumbled the ball in injury time  ghost should have been at jons side as he strode out cant believe they missed that those giants and mammoths though  wow all the folk giving it meh in the forums need to defrost their frozen souls if this didnt get your blood flowing youre a goddam wight "
"692" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-06-09 " i was thinking that was the point of keeping giantsbane for questioningso they could find out if he had told mance that jon snow had betrayed them but then jon snow left before they started the questioning sowho knows the reason jon snow didnt take his sword or ghost is im assuming because those 2 things were kept at castle black when jon snow was last with mance rightand so if he turned up to mance with his sword and snow mance would know that he must still be on the side of the nights watch "
"693" "QuestionMark83" 2014-06-09 " superb episode quickly paced and nice to see the focus on one story arc for a change of formula this should silence the critics of the character intensive and build up episodes for at least for a week fantastic action sequences too a giant with a javelin for an arrow kill of the week and a massive scythe playing newtons cradle with some wildlings right in the thick of the war the red shirted ensigns of the nights watch stood no chance and when sam told ollie to get a weapon and kill someone you sadly knew ygrittes number was up "
"694" "BenjyUK" 2014-06-09 " i refuse to hear that there is a problem with jon snow "
"695" "eyedropper" 2014-06-09 " i dont think she could see him sam was slightly out of sight loading the crossbows "

"704" "keef1980" 2014-06-09 " i hadnt really had much of a problem with the wall scenes this series but i have to admit that in a way the strength of the scenes allisers bravery and turning out to be alright pyp grenn edd made me wish wed seen a bit more of them all this year im not up to date in the books but the combination of not having seen stannis for several episodes combined with the memory of the quite dramatic scene of davos reading the letter out loud where he seemed to chill as he read the word implores makes me think that they may well be on their way no spoilers or knowing winks if im right or if theres something ive missed though please as for jon  i dont get what his plan is  is he trying to sneak in or is he actually wanting to fight his way to mance one more question and this is a stupid one i know but what are the wildlings actually after are they basically after refuge from the white walkers and all the supernatural stuff north of the wall "
"705" "Mirthin" 2014-06-09 " not enough shieldsurfing and hopping on arrows for you "
"706" "meliflaw" 2014-06-09 " the problem with jon is that he only appears to have three settings heroic lovelorn or grumpy this is perhaps a function of his being an attractive juvenile just as dany is an attractive ingenue hired for their looks and their ability to draw a younger audience its always been a stockintrade with most shows whatever size the screen and i think some writers just forget to give such characters some scope and shading it takes a skilled performer with a lot of personality to go beyond the prettyface junk and to fight for the right to do so "

"708" "elleesse" 2014-06-09 " what of slynt now two people three if you count the baby have witnessed his cowardliness enjoyed this episode particularly how immanent death pushed sam into finally kissing gilly and into actually fighting and killing someone if gilly hadnt turned up i wonder would the same level of bravery by sam have been seen i think not he had something to fight for  which kind of contradicts the duty is the death of love line had it not been for love he might not have had so much to fight for without gilly and the baby he would be fighting to cling on to his miserable life with a bunch of criminals in a brutal cold place with no escape ever on the horizon the giant scythe thing was great fretted for the poor woolly mammoths burning bum though dont like to see animals getting harmed even cgi ones glad that ygritte is gone i just didnt like her character even though it was acted well and so on if i were a man i personally would find her irritating and bossy and knowitall annoying although again on the topic of love maybe not actually being the death of duty with ygritte gone dying in his arms perhaps the death of his only lover helped prompt jons suicide mission speaking of the suicide mission how on earth is jon going to manage to see mance without being massacred before he even reaches the wildling army curious to see the now get out of that solution and not forgetting tyrions wanting to keep his head dilemma although am betting that neither of these will even feature next week "
"709" "Catch22" 2014-06-09 " that was a little meh i dont know too much violence for me id have preferred a bit more character focus on jon and co but still ygritte cant say i care much really "
"710" "keef1980" 2014-06-09 " also hes at the place where ironically considering how people tend to end up there his stark traits of honour duty etc are exactly whats needed "
"711" "meliflaw" 2014-06-09 " yeah that makes sense and while grenn and pyp are good characters i would have been quite upset to see edd leave us ive grown to love edd hes eeyore with a sword "

"714" "Kelley Mickey" 2014-06-09 " great change of pace from the usual bounce around from place to place it showed the reality of men being put into an impossible situation some will rise to heroics and some will fall into cowardice after seeing this episode i too wish more time had been spent on the wall those men really are the backbone of the defense of westeros and black sheep or not they really came throughso now will jon snow wander around westeros more or less aimlessly like so many before him trying to find manse how long will it take im still not crazy about jon snow he knows very little i dont know if its the character the actor the writing or a combination of all three but i just find jon snow less than interesting sam has become a real revelation to me hes smart thoughtful and really isnt the coward he thinks he is he could become very important to the nights watch maybe a married maester "
"715" "Sinequanone" 2014-06-09 " agree 100 always liked jon  he is an actual hero in a world with very few true ones "

"718" "gerold" 2014-06-09 " i also agree the decision to try and meetkill mance unarmednot that it should make a difference seems a bit sillyhes not jaquen hgar or a ninja from the north pole they finished thormund and the thenns on their side of the wall which was really the most dangerous challenge  whats the problem with now just defending the wall from the top its because the wildlings arent actually the enemy wildlings and nw are actually on the same side its like what jon told mance about why he was deserting he wants to fight on the side of the living every wildling who dies north of th ewall will become a much more dangerous enemy when the white walkers bring them back as wights so jon needs to become a diplomat and make that alliance happen meeting with mance after defeating the first attack is the perfect time to get both sides on board "

"730" "austerlitz1311" 2014-06-09 " thats true but i think he struck the right balance with lotr might be because he already had a fantastic set of characters he could just do what he was good at "
"731" "austerlitz1311" 2014-06-09 " the moment with jon cradling ygritte felt more than a little crowbarred in considering they were quite literally in the middle of a violent melee this i almost hoped someone was going to stab him in the back it seemed that ridiculous and the way it faded out sad music then bam back to the wall another 15 minutes of action "

"760" "bleudegex" 2014-06-09 " i dont see him as a contender for the throne leader of the nights watch definitely and maybe lord of winterfell at some point but i dont see how he could become king unless he marries daenerys "

"762" "Zepp" 2014-06-09 " sometimes they play with the number of appearances in casting when a count of who is appearing when threatens to be a spoiler by way of example the wiki listing for the tv show fargo only had billy bob thornton appearing in five episodes back at the start of the season he did in fact show up in more than five "
"763" "hexatu" 2014-06-09 " how much food does an army of 100000 need and how much is there to eat in those nearby woods hold them off 3 days and im certain theyd be eating each other "
"764" "hexatu" 2014-06-09 " surely we could have had some scenes with mance and his entourage this episode no it wouldnt have had to be much just a few minutes of him pointing out the weakness of the night s watch and laying out his battle plans that definitely was a weak point it just worsened the sense of mance rayder and his army taking a long time to get near the wall a whole season  after hed sent jon etc on ahead so long ago i cant remember in fact i love the show but the pacing isnt its strongest point theres a lot of repetitive scenessituations with the same characters apparently going nowhere or backwards while youre waiting episode after episode for a scrap of news from some other corner the shows very well written but the story arc just isnt tight enough i agree with sarah that for all its grandeur this episode felt like it should have come midseason "
"765" "Kamanyo" 2014-06-09 " well then it kind of is their land in some respects maybe my lack of affection for the nights watch comes from what sarah identified as the relatively offhand way their storyline developed the wildlings seem more interesting with their tribes and internal conflicts their acephalous politics and with their temporary unity under a warlord of sorts but i agree with you the wildlingnw storyline seems to be a counterpoint to the real much more ominous threat to everyone in westeros "
"766" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-09 " interesting to hear your reaction to ygrittes final moments personally i couldnt get past the supercrigeworthy tv cliche of a woman dying in mans arms in the middle of super violent battle while all the fighting blurs in the background slow motion ofc suddenly no one bothers them just for enough time to say all the proper goodbyes totally got me out of the moment i think this show deserves better i get where youre coming from and in a lot of ways i agree with you however and please dont take this as an insult i feel as though you looked at that scene with a bit too much cynicism it was a bit of a tired old cliche but then again maybe its a cliche because its been done so many times because it works i actually cried at bit during that scene despite simultaneously recognizing that i was being blatantly manipulated in such a cliched and unoriginal way "
"767" "Tadhginsalzburg" 2014-06-09 " heres a thought does mance raydar know that jon betrayed ygrite and her fellow wildlings as they have been on the westeros side of the wall since climbing it that could explain why jon thinks he has a good chance of infiltrating mances ranks hell of a risk hes taking "
"768" "UndyingCincinnatus" 2014-06-09 " its impossible not to compare them to peter jacksons epics from lord of the rings minas tirith and helms deep spring to mind exactly what i was thinking while watching you just cant help but compare them and though this episode was remarkable for what it achieved entire tv episode dedicated to one fight it simply wasnt as good as lotr the moment with jon cradling ygritte felt more than a little crowbarred in considering they were quite literally in the middle of a violent melee the third you have wall moment was one too many and there seemed to be an awful lot of free folk slaughtering crows compared to the reverse considering the outcome of the battle  these were amongst the worst of its problems still i enjoyed it but it was up against the very best battle scenes in the business and couldnt quite make its case best moment of the episode getting about 30 minutes in and realising my god were actually going to have an episode without daenerys "
"769" "discoveryofslood" 2014-06-09 " i actually rooted for the wildlings its their land anyway its their land in the same sense that the usa is the native americans land having said that i think part of the point of the wildlingnw story is to show the pathetic human squabbling which doesnt matter a jot compared to the threat of the demonic others bearing down on them "
"770" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-09 " ive read this blog for the last two seasons and i think youve done an excellent job of making this about the show and not the books and with game of thrones that has probably been more difficult than with any other booktoshow conversion ever though for me this just makes sense the books are the books and the show is the show "
"771" "PATROKLUS00" 2014-06-09 " while not entirely disputing the characterization of alexander as a coldblooded warrior and alcoholic he was also a brilliant politician and pannationalist he saw the way to build empire was to coopt and absorb the conquered rather than enslave them he recognized ability as well as political acumen as exemplified by his treatment of porrus after their monumental battle having aristotle as a teacher did not leave him unaffected "
"772" "maclau1" 2014-06-09 " the only battle scene from the lord of the rings which worked for me was the ride of the rohirrim and jackson still blew it in part say what you will about george rr martin and his writing the creators of got can actually tell a story "
"773" "discoveryofslood" 2014-06-09 " we watch it as a family yes that probably sounds bizarre yeah a lot of people find it weird that i watch the show with my parents when im not at uni i would agree with you on the hobbit movies although they do have the advantages of a much higher visual effects budget "
"774" "maclau1" 2014-06-09 " i suspect youll enjoy it on a larger screen it was very well done "

"784" "boleyngroupie" 2014-06-09 " great episode imo and not just because i have the hots for jon snow kit harrington its true we dont see enough of the nights watch i think jons a real contender for the throne people keep saying how we dont see that much of him how he doesnt have a lot of story or interest i feel that hes the quiet underdog and his story is building slowly hes learning maturing but he was always smart and strong i still want to know who his mom is because perhaps that will give him a real stake to the throne as a lady of course i loved the ygrittejon storyline having read this part in the book i knew the end was coming i dont recall the exact scene but dont think it was as sweet as this episode i liked the sweetness jons smile ahhh please do not kill jon george do not ruin my life "
"785" "RoomSixteen" 2014-06-09 " this was a strangely even perversely lifeless and bloodless episode despite all the hacking and slashing nothing much actually happened or at least nothing i found at all gripping me too when the battle began it was oh well here they go again and i just resigned myself to waiting it out after all there was still more than half the episode left so i figured wed see some scenes relevant to the plot before the evening was out but no such luck they just kept bashing metal for half an hour straight "
"786" "Kamanyo" 2014-06-09 " i actually rooted for the wildlings its their land anyway and their system of government seems no worse than that of the rest of westeros also it would be great to just watch this wildling army march south creating all sort of mayhem if only they werent so damn stupid "
"787" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " i actually much preferred show ygritte horrible massacre of villagers and all i thought rose leslie did pretty well with the role book ygritte drove me mad but i do think that more could have been made of the wildings cause and desire for to live free  there were some references but i always found it quite powerful and some of that was lost "

"797" "scandibaby" 2014-06-09 " it would be a tad difficult for jon to blend with the wildlings if ghost were at his side now a mammoth that would work "
"798" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " yes good point  and also when tormond tries to call him boy you can see jon dismissing it as it means so little after all hes just been through "

"801" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-06-09 " one of the bloodiest episodes imo if you could catch the background of the warp speed fighting it must have taken forever to film there was a wonderful tracking shot or long take in the battle scene that followed jon just after he got off the lift to yigrette shooting arrows to magnar swinging his axe and back to sam as he came down the opposite set of stairs that jon went down 360 degrees of courtyard melee covered in one shot "
"802" "WhoGivesADamn" 2014-06-09 " i think the screenwriters need to soften her cockiness a bit "

"806" "scandibaby" 2014-06-09 " exactly  hes out of commission but not dead with jon in search of mace the men of the nights watch will need alliser more than ever i keep hoping that one of the men will turn out to be a brienne  a woman who likes fighting there were many such women who disguised themselves as men to fight in wars throughout history "
"807" "Owakahnige" 2014-06-09 " i loved it fantastic battle one of the best ever produced for a tv series the details were great the cook attacking with a meat cleaver the giant getting all upset when a fellow giant died the giant firing that massive arrow arrow it was a ballista blasting that guy into the sky mammoths fuck it im going to watch it all again "
"808" "scandibaby" 2014-06-09 " i totally agree i was reminded of olennas conversation with margery about her seduction of a targaryen when maester aemon told sam his love story "
"809" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-06-09 " i liked barry lyndon as i like all kubrick films except eyes wide shut but i could have used more light realism be damned "
"810" "scandibaby" 2014-06-09 " with 100000 wildlings and thenns they undoubtedly set the fire at the same time from across the forest so it lit up at once in the early stages it might have appeared as campfires but i agree that the watchman is probably the progenitor of the crewman on the titanic watching for icebergs "
"811" "NeitherYankNorBrit" 2014-06-09 " yourre right it was better for one thing this didnt have shieldsurfing dwarf puns or last minute rescues "

"813" "discoveryofslood" 2014-06-09 " a night assault does actually make more sense strategically although they kind of squandered any advantage from it by lighting up the scenery with that forest fire so yeah may as well have been daylight "
"814" "DolleDolf" 2014-06-09 " i find jon a lot more liekable than ned and robb jon is all that the other two are yet he is a reject which makes him a more tragic and therefore more compelling figure "

"816" "discoveryofslood" 2014-06-09 " the territories of the boltons are in the south of the north the people who would bear the brunt of the wildlings advance would be the umbers and the karstarks who are rooses main rivals so a wildling invasion might actually benefit the boltons "
"817" "EnglishDisco" 2014-06-09 " i think pushing out dues ex machina from this episode made it stronger in the long run  yes i was pissed that the episode ended when it did  but when watching this back to back on bluray later all will be forgiven i hope illegal download "
"818" "austerlitz1311" 2014-06-09 " totally agree the trouble with relying on hour long battle scenes now is that its impossible not to compare them to peter jacksons epics from lord of the rings minas tirith and helms deep spring to mind characters you care about and a battle swinging back and forth with plenty of action to keep you entertained this frankly just wasnt as good "
"819" "DolleDolf" 2014-06-09 " still not sold on the storyline i think the storyline is the weakest part of the entire got experience it feels like a script that is made haphazardly on the go which is probably is as the writer is still putting out the books apparently without knowing himself where the storyline is going "
"820" "austerlitz1311" 2014-06-09 " the trouble with any hour long battle scenes now is that its impossible not to compare them to peter jacksons epics from lord of the rings minas tirith and helms deep spring to mind characters you care about and a battle swinging back and forth with plenty of action to keep you entertained this frankly just wasnt as good "
"821" "DolleDolf" 2014-06-09 " cant say i entirely disagree although there were some stirring speeches that hit the mark the heroic and seemingly until the final shot  ingnoredl ast stand at the gate was good and ygritte getting her own back from the kid with the arrow was a good twist the whole sam and gilly unattractive peeps can have some luvving too grates on me ygrittes end whispering you dohnt knoh nuttin john snoh  was as predictable as it comes plus a minutes long farewell dying hug as there is a battle raging is pure hollywood nonsense in a situation like that where there is a swords thrust and axes hack a knifes slash or an arrows whoosh at any time from any angle i was kind of disappointed when i realised the entire episode was going to be a drawn out battle scene i could have done with the imp in his cell spouting some verbosities varys rubbing his hands cersei and jamie getting an incestuous makeup romp in or even the tedious dragon fancier girl prancing about in a mild to moderate state of undress to break the monotony not the weakest episode though there were 2 earlier this season that ms hughes described as gently paced a chartitable description for fuck all happened borefests "
"822" "maclau1" 2014-06-09 " i know whats supposed to happen we watch it as a family yes that probably sounds bizarre no spoilers though i imagine a fair number of this lot have memorized the books much better than the tripe known as the hobbit movies "
"823" "maclau1" 2014-06-09 " sarah thanks for the review though i disagree with you about some parts i especially like the fact that you engage with the readers even those who disagree with you this is a significantly better thread than others today agree about edd still i have to wonder how theyre going to wrap things up next week the giants were flipping cool "
"824" "EnglishDisco" 2014-06-09 " the woman had a terrible temper and she put up quite the fight when i laid hands on her it was all i could do to carry her home and get her out o’ them furs but when i did oh she was hotter than even i remembered and we had a fine old time and then i went to sleep next morning when i woke the snow had stopped and the sun was shining but i was in no fit state to enjoy it all ripped and torn i was and had me member bit right off and there on me floor was a shebear’s pelt and soon enough the free folk were telling tales of this bald bear seen in the woods with the queerest pair o’ cubs behind her har” he slapped his meaty thigh “would that i could find her again she was fine to lay with that bear never was a woman give me such a fight nor such strong sons neither” "

"827" "discoveryofslood" 2014-06-09 " yeah but if they put off the climax of the siege of castle black until next season people are going to be pissed "
"828" "randdom" 2014-06-09 " i thought this weeks episode showcased jon snows more developed character still as earnest and loyal as season 1 but now with a sharpened edge of cynicism the way he dealt with tormond was great no swashbuckling just a worldweary crossbow to the leg "
"829" "Jess_Ghost" 2014-06-09 " he did already tell people about this last season he mentioned the blade he used "
"830" "MRONeill" 2014-06-09 " sarahs words and those of the commentators have largely transformed my initial disappointment with this episode as stated i thought the acting was great as well as the dive into some of the lesser characters i love sam and gilly john bradley was as always wonderful really how big were her feet i didnt mean in the same room i have always liked jon snow and not just because hes so darned attractivealthough it does make my sunday nights when he smiles  but that has been discussed quite a bit already i realize that my disappointment largely revolved around what i viewed as some lackingunconvincing setsa first for this show for me the cgi was all wonderful husband is that a giant me that is a giant riding a mammoth while literally clapping with glee  the wall chain got a rewind gotta see that again as did the stunning scene with the giant rushing the inner gate rip grenn but i found the close ups on top of the wall as well as many of the courtyard scenes to be lacking in realism i found myself distracted is that literally white styrofoam carved to look like ice and even on the wonderful full pan shot of the entire courtyard my first thought was that it reminded me of the sets of disneys hook dustin hoffman robin williams anyone anyone all of this said far be it for me to be just another clever little twat with a mouthim forever and wholly devoted to got already in rewatching the episode im focusing on what matters and loving it more and more "
"831" "roganis" 2014-06-09 " i hope that ser alliser lives as due punishment needs to carried out on that craven janos slynt thorne would have to deal harshly with him especially as the nights watch know how close the two were "
"832" "KieRanaRan" 2014-06-09 " agreed this shows good at making you change your perspective of characters and this week my respect for thorne has grown significantly "
"833" "Uppereastside" 2014-06-09 " how long until the watch realizes that the wall wasnt built to keep out wildlings nobody would build a gigantic ice wall to fence out humans or semihuman giants etc let everyone but wws pass through "
"834" "KieRanaRan" 2014-06-09 " can i just say sam was on form this episode from a technical point of view the episode was very well done noticed a few others mention that long continuous shot  really draws you in to the world as long as jon remembered to bring that hammer he caved styrs skull in with there should hopefully be no need for longclaw or ghost "
"835" "Annuska" 2014-06-09 " im not sure i will survive long enough to read the last book which is projected to be published sometime like 2022 "
"836" "Annuska" 2014-06-09 " i think in the midst of the pathos the great brief moments of humor have not been praised enough im not a bleeding poet no youre really not and that great moment when thorne loses it with the men at the top of the wall "
"837" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-06-09 " yep they could have sent more men with ygritte to climb over the wall at an undefended point and thus had a better chance of taking castle black from the south side "
"838" "Annuska" 2014-06-09 " somebody shouts get him inside hes last seen screaming hold the fucking gate while people are dragging him inside if hed died we would have been shown "
"839" "mcscotty" 2014-06-09 " but prior to this episode the nights watch seemed to be one of the few bodged storylines with david benioff and db weiss failing to build tension or capitalise on the heady days of season one when we genuinely cared about jon sam and the rest of this dysfunctional band i havent seen series 4 yet even though i have succumbed to reading some reviews and even caught the odd youtube clip so things may have changed in season 4 but the only storyline that has so far failed to catch my interest is the whole mother of dragons malarkey i hope series 4 is different but she spent three series trotting from city to city and taking them over without much of a fight her squawky dragons are cute but the storyline is flat will she ever make it back to westeros i sometimes wish her evil brother was still around so she could have someone to fight with "
"840" "Lesa Smart" 2014-06-09 " it was actually in the books the one time when rr martin went sentimental on us "

"842" "gaudinostolemyvolvo" 2014-06-09 " also alsohow did they get taking by surprise by that massive fire surely they must have noticed when it became a medium sized fire and then a pretty big fire and then an alarmingly large fire the nights watch really need to bring in some kind of eye test before they let people take their oaths "
"843" "Simon Thomson" 2014-06-09 " i dont think they do love or coupled relationships terribly well in this tv series completely agree that season 1 robb and jon had clear and interesting and differentiated characters but robb with that poor murdered girl when will there be some comeuppance for that still traumatised and jon with ygritte were both just insipid and dull i think benioff and weiss agree with sam that men follow orders and fight and they dont really get what happens when a man falls in love or needs a bit of a break ned got away with it because his relationship with his wife was so interesting and difficult and because he was a father which i think got in general connects with and explores in quite an interesting way so now in my mind jon is just a bit of a wet rag who occasionally fights really well and whom sam adores for some godforsaken reason thats a gross exaggeration for rhetorical effect but you know what i mean "

"846" "roganis" 2014-06-09 " remembering that slynt was the evil rat who killed the baby barra in season 2 i was very concerned at what sam was going to find when he went back for gilly and little sam luckily on this occasion got didnt go for the emotional jugular i did have mixed feelings when ygritte died sad but at the same time thinking well if shes gone then surely gilly and little sam should be ok "

"849" "Carybdeida" 2014-06-09 " i cant for the life of me figure out why ygritte did not put a couple of arrows into him whilst he cradled his dying brother because if she had then he couldnt tell anyone that dragon glass kills the ww when the shit really hits the fan "
"850" "Carybdeida" 2014-06-09 " as much as i would love to see that i dont think they can film and edit that quick remember the books are still being written "

"852" "EnglishDisco" 2014-06-09 " ygritte interrupted tormunds husband to bears anecdote  probably the funniest thing i read in any of the books for that reason alone she deserved to die "

"854" "Carybdeida" 2014-06-09 " ygritte had to die after the fall out between her and js between cause loyalties over personal issues conflicted it was him or her and the difference is that the wildlings are just trying to flee the wws while the crows are the only thing standing in the way of the wws total domination of westeros "
"855" "Sgt_Sanity" 2014-06-09 " i have been yearning for a really dramatic and chaotic battle scene and this episode delivered there are many way to die and i think we saw most of them last night my wife was sure sam tarly was going to die because he presented such a large target and i cant for the life of me figure out why ygritte did not put a couple of arrows into him whilst he cradled his dying brother perhaps she was searching for jon snow "
"856" "Carybdeida" 2014-06-09 " i think it was the best episode thus far simply because it stayed focused in one location i would be much happier to see the show running five days a week with each episode just focused on one plot instead of once a week jumping all over westeros and wherever danny is in essos "
"857" "EnglishDisco" 2014-06-09 " as someone else has mentioned  its quite poetic that the show runners have sidelined the nw storyline this season as all the westerosi nobles have done exactly the same too taken up with the power struggle in kings landing to see the bigger picture i felt the same when reading the books  every time a jon chapter came up at first id be like ah fuck this storyline then id get a couple of paragraphs in and think oh yeah  with the exception of one "
"858" "Carybdeida" 2014-06-09 " hbo gave got another two episodes but thats conditional on if grrms health hold out most people know the story cant be told correctly in less than 8 "
"859" "Victover" 2014-06-09 " this particular series is creating a tragedy of sorts for people who wouldnt be able to wait a full year for season 5 and then the same for season 6 wo getting wacky some of the audience may pass away while they waiti have a solutionseason 5 and 6 should be aired every second week to give time to the crew to shorten up the hiatus to only six months thus they take care of a lot of the negative side effects "

"863" "Carybdeida" 2014-06-09 " did he buy some soldiers with all that money in the bank we still have to find out where davos and salladhor sailed off to before we get an answer to that one i was wondering what ever happened to the faceless man but now im wondering where jorah is going to go "
"864" "MsEnvelop" 2014-06-09 " i think this was the best episode of the season i enjoyed it a lot i do not agree with sarahs comments on jon i personally care for jon and i always have yes he is a bit boring but this is because he is really very clear on many issues he got tested with ygritte and the actor gave a superb performance about a young man torn between love duty and honor i also like the actors performance because js is a melancholic character and we really feel it when we see js he had a tough childhood and that left scars on him but still he did not become like ramsey or many other terrible characters on the show neither is he tyrion he does not have the same feeling of superiority over others or bitterness towards life he is so far a hero in the making believing that he can make life better well see if he will ever become that hero "
"865" "bananaballs" 2014-06-09 " so you reckon jon snow will be a dragon rider "
"866" "dsk84" 2014-06-09 " yeah agree with that the issue of internalising is something that a number of characters suffer from sansa is another one though they finally seem to have gotten past that matter it would be a difficult challenge though with jon and dany but it does seem to be a mistake spending 5 minutes an episode at times on characters that have this issue the only way to address what theyre thinking is either to have them info dump onto another character ygritte or sam for jon jorah daario or missendei for dany or have their thoughts translated into actions somehow but a couple of minutes an episode doesnt really address that "
"867" "rockstar7" 2014-06-09 " wait can we all stop and mourn the depressing fact that only one episode is left in season 4 "
"868" "CentralBelter" 2014-06-09 " is there a bad way to be reminded of barry lyndon i guess setting battles in the dark makes sense for a director as a the cgi looks better and b your actors arent likely to be as well trained in the arts of fencing and general derringdo as say douglas fairbanks jnr or errol flynn so darkness is flattering "
"869" "bleudegex" 2014-06-09 " that must have been interesting for the american viewers as far as i know they dont have the word minge over there "

"876" "Carybdeida" 2014-06-09 " i was actually hoping to see the wall fall this season as a cliff hanger for what to expect next season but with so many loose strings to tie up i dont see how that is going to happen now so my only real thought is how they are going to tie up all the loose ends and leave us in anticipation for the next ten months "
"877" "CentralBelter" 2014-06-09 " yes  the poetic justice was maybe a bit too neat but it was nicely set up all the same "
"878" "dsk84" 2014-06-09 " for a second i actually thought the ham was a part of slynt not saying for a second that rape is a brave action its completely cowardly but slynt had lost his nerve so much by that stage that even something like rape was beyond him i mean there were giants marching on them and he trotted out that tired old line that theyre a fairy tale "

"884" "bleudegex" 2014-06-09 " im not sure whats happening with stannis presumably hes got loads of soldiers now but it would be a bit repetitive if he tried to invade kings landing in the same way he did in season 2 he must have something up his sleeve also varys has hardly done anything all season littlefingers got all kinds of scheming going on  so what is varys up to "

"900" "BeheadtheRoyals" 2014-06-09 " dolorous edd was the hero of the episode as a book reader i obviously had a hint of what was going to happen but as a telly watcher i was thrilled by the superb acting of different characters during the wildlings attack and dolorous edd subbing in for jon snow commanding the top of the wall and managing to release the scythe was one of the most exciting pieces of acting stay tuned for the last episode and then be prepared to suffer a painful and long withdrawal for several months "

"903" "DiamondDag" 2014-06-09 " my own feelings on the lack of material come down to a similar issue i have with dany the problem in translating jon and dany is so much of who they are as characters is internalised which is hard to express on tv sam gets choice scenes with lots of characters because he has no pretense of being a leader so he can lay all his emotions and motivations out in the open for the audience to see characters like jon and dany have to be leaders this limits the kind of emotions they can lay bare obviously the books get around this by going inside their heads and showing us more of who they are unfortunately the show has kind of dropped the ball with the two ways of getting around that jons time with ygritte could have been a chance to learn more about jon but they didnt really dig into what drives him being a bastard and with dany they could have used her relationship with daario to show a different side to her but chose to have her keep him at arms length for the entire season and then just use him for sex ive been absolutely baffled by the way theyve written dany this season also edd is brilliant "

"905" "backfromtokyo" 2014-06-09 " should say i do love the wall and beyond the wall and i did really like this episode it didnt end the way i thought it would and i was surprised that its going to play out over over two episodes but thats my fault for making assumptions "
"906" "hexatu" 2014-06-09 " surely the whole point of jon snow is that hes the bastard son who was just much a brother to robb etc as the rest but unloved by the mother who raised them explains the sullen keepinghisowncounsel bit fair enough i always resumehope hes the eventual successful heir to ned not being a reader of the book with a final showdown for control of the north with that other real bastard of a bastard ramsay bolton but that trip outside the gate towards the very cool giants and company doesnt seem very promising "
"907" "CentralBelter" 2014-06-09 " we learnt enough history from jons trek with ygritte to know that the wildlings hate the watch for having driven them north put up a bloody great wall and spent hundreds of years hunting them and killing them the decadence of the watch and the kingdoms is their chance to get back what they consider theirs and get some revenge so no chance of working together there "
"908" "Gladiatrix" 2014-06-09 " no because achilles was the epitome of an enfant terrible like alexander the great  a stonecold killer even as a child with a frightening grasp of weaponry tactics and strategy that someone as young as that should not have had jon snow has been trained from a young age as all boys in the medieval period were to some degree but he is not a terrifyingly good warrior nor does he lack empathy with other people neither achilles nor alexander were known for their social skills the latter particlarly taking refuge from having to be sociable at all in the nearest supply of alcohol but were known for their willingness to use mass slaughter as a means of terror "

"910" "DanLucas" 2014-06-09 " do you reckon the writers have bodged ygritte a bit in the show she comes across first as a bit grating with her relentless mocking of jon becoming evermore undeserved then downright mean what with all the killing innocent villagers i dont remember her or the wildlings being that unsympathetic in the books "
"911" "CentralBelter" 2014-06-09 " can we have a battle in the daylight next series please "
"912" "backfromtokyo" 2014-06-09 " season 1 episode 9 jon is upset about neds arrest and that he cant do anything to help maester aemon has a discussion with him about love being the death of duty  which he brought up again in this episode  and reveals his past httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpozi5n6aio "
"913" "bleudegex" 2014-06-09 " im not sure the wildlings seem intent on brutally murdering everyone they meet south of the wall i think theyd be a threat to the cosy feudal system theyve got going on in westeros i dont think theyd take kindly to some lord telling them what to do "
"914" "Ctid1977" 2014-06-09 " that was for me by far the best episode yet loads to love i loved all the extra focus on the minor characters showing the scale of the battlei loved thorne it was great to see a three dimensional arsehole for a change i enjoyed him telling jon how it is he has the voice for battle command and his speeches were all fantastic i dont think hes dead either which makes me happy as i was convinced he would buy it as soon as he started being coolgrenn and co shouting the vows at a rushing giant was hair raisingthe scythe looked spectacularpyps death and sam being a heroi loved tormunds capture tooas for the scene with ygritte i was honestly welling up as much as i was when i read it i thought it was really well done even jons smilethe little touches like the giant going mad when the other giant died was cool and that shot where it pans from jon to ygritte tormund the thenn and then to sam was spectacular "
"915" "pureimagination" 2014-06-09 " i also love book jon but am not so sure about tv jon i dont think its kits acting i think its that the wall story has been so continuously underdeveloped i wont give any spoilers but i do think in the books you really get the sense of castle black as a place with different political tensions  almost as much as kings landing  and jon stuck in the middle of it all trying and failing to get people to focus on the others rather than maintaining or improving their place in a doomed hierarchy as soon as they sent the party up to crasters they lost their chance to show all of that great juicy political stuff before the battle as a result they had to kill two of the best wall characters  pyp and grenn  simply because they didnt have other 3d characters to spare it also meant that the battle was way more about love teenage love at that than it was about duty to be honest id have preferred it the other way around but complex politics need careful setup everything at kings landing is a masterclass in the way this can be done and im hoping benioff  weiss apply those lessons to the wall for next season that said hats off to neil marshall on his direction the whole thing looked so amazing that i honestly wished they were doing cinema screenings in the uk mammoths giants archery abseiling "
"916" "backfromtokyo" 2014-06-09 " i think its actually that the show is mirroring the books what i mean is from the very start  and this isnt spoilerish at all  i have felt that the wall is going to be a major part of some big endgame to the series hence everything that happens at the wall leading up to that endgame never feels quite as important as it should other parts of the story are more selfcontained but the wall has a really really really long arc "
"917" "otcdave" 2014-06-09 " i almost hope the wildlings break through just so they can destroy the boltons "
"918" "maclean3" 2014-06-09 " hes only appeared in 7 so far and is clearly seen in the trailer for next week "
"919" "kam1nsk1" 2014-06-09 " typical hero in got oh dearnbsp where should the flowers go "
"920" "CentralBelter" 2014-06-09 " thats the problem with filming scene like that  you need to see characters being cut to pieces left right and centre but still have enough left at the end i guess in a real skirmish like that there wouldnt be too many balletic oneslash kills and you wouldnt get someone like tormond wading through 10 enemies in as many seconds "
"921" "Mmmrrrggglll" 2014-06-09 " i still dont understand why its a problem if the wildings head south its the whitewalkers that are the real threat and in any case let em smash the boltons who cares i havent read the books but i have never bought the threat from the wildlings why wouldnt manse and the black watch work together against the whitewalkers "
"922" "CentralBelter" 2014-06-09 " every time i see edd i i get confused for a moment and think what the hells bronn doing here i was about to ask am i the only one but i think i know the answer already "
"923" "RasLob" 2014-06-09 " great episode i dont agree that we would have been more invested if we had stayed with the watch a bit more that whole storyline has continued to bore me to tears for a while and seeing more of it wouldnt have made it better this episode did a great job of caring about the wall again so good job show creators but for as much as grrm gets credit for subverting fantasy tropes this was every bit a battle in the helms deepminas tirith mold where a beleaguered band defend against an overwhelming force and interesting that ygritte got a nice unmessy death including time for last words with her lover compared to last weeks horror show "

"927" "laser24" 2014-06-09 " great episode my only problem was that there was only meant to be 20 men in the court yard and the rest on the wall yet in the actual fight it looked like there was way more than 20 men in the court yard "
"928" "Empedokles" 2014-06-09 " agreed "
"929" "KnifeInsurance" 2014-06-09 " whos the crow that wont cop out the problem with jon snow is that hes a fairly straight heroic type in a story that is heavy on the subversion and warping of stock characters the certified nice guy who deals in a lot of derringdo and little inner turmoil and is rarely seen out of his depth he is by no means a bad character mind and i think kit harington gives a quietly assured performance certainly an oftunderrated one anyway it was a rather rousing beatup bonanza almost on par with sir lancelots assault on swamp castle and a merciful break from our weekly helpings of courtly intrigue and enucleations pleasantly surprised by ser allisers brief foray out of his gunnery sergeant hartman persona a smidgen less pleasantly by the icy hand of death upon grenn and pyp err and perhaps im a terrible sentimentalist but ygrittes death was really quite affecting undiminished by the inexplicable power of ollies toy bow and his terrifying smug nod im entirely with sarah here cant we have rose leslie back somehow it could have been worse though  imagine the pickle that would have ensued if those giants had figured out a bit sooner that they were supposed to lift the bloody gate all along "
"930" "dumbwit" 2014-06-09 " a good episode but not a great one the game changer for this series was the previous episode and probably the next one i liked the scythe on the wall and of course even mammoths will run from fire will be interesting to see how jon snow can convince the enemy to back off if rose had really wanted to kill snow she would have done it the first time she had the chance as she can take the eye out of a rabbit at 200 yards glad the baldy cannibal bought it with snow learning from one of his previous adversaries that spitting blood in your opponents eye can actually work ghost did what he does best going for the jugular unusually the whole episode was spent on the one storyline which worked pretty well instead of jumping about a lot between different locations "
"931" "jimmy_mac" 2014-06-09 " well this episode really changed my view of jon snow i previously did not much care what happened to him similar to sarah i saw him as a fairly limited personality now in my opinion he is one of the most heroic characters on the show i see him as much less twodimensional now and im rooting for him also at some point news of his bravery and leadership may travel south i think stannis and davos are keeping their ears open for news from the wall so is tywin i suspect at some point jon snow will be recognized for his bravery in defending the realm whether he can actually stop the wildling hordes and whitewalkers from invading is another matter but hes committed and apparently willing to give it everything hes got he admits his desire to dismantle the invading army by taking out their leader mance is a bad plan but as was pointed out who has another plan go for it jon good luck "
"932" "bleudegex" 2014-06-09 " yeah i agree that the wall storyline should have been given more prominence this season but i still thought it packed an emotional punch grenns death especially i think the biggest problem is that it seems like years since weve seen mance a lot of people will have almost forgotten him "
"933" "mozza92" 2014-06-09 " the episode 10 trailer is up on youtube tyrion is definitely in it "
"934" "pureimagination" 2014-06-09 " i also dont think it could be olenna the way she talked about marrying a targaryen it was someone she definitely did not like but aemon thinks of this piece of history as a big love affair for his sake hes so sweet i like to hope his feelings were requited aemons also talked about how he was tempted to renege his vows on three different occasions one would have been when he was offered the crown one was roberts rebellion when his family was butchered hands down the third temptation must be this great love affair personally i like to believe that he has a secret and unknown to him targaryen grandchild knocking around somewhere ready to be one of the dragonriders but then i like crackpot theories "
"935" "dsk84" 2014-06-09 " i agree largely but one of the best kills from the episode came from the cook when he smashed that cleaver through a thenns skull "
"936" "SiobhanNIB" 2014-06-09 " well thanks for being woman enough to admit it "
"937" "Dewulf" 2014-06-09 " i thought it was a big slash to his leg tbh  so he should be alive but unable to fight for a while id guess but the big question will be who leads on will slynts cowardice come out jons obviously goneshame ghost couldnt take over for him lol hmm there is possibly someone elsehavent read the books so idk butyeah ill leave that unsaid hehehe one more week to go oh noes "
"938" "dsk84" 2014-06-09 " my main issue with jon isnt so much the performance as the general lack of material hes had this was easily his strongest episode though since for once he was the central character in an episode it did help i did really enjoy that im not a bleeding poet line and for whatever reason can strongly relate to where hes coming from as many people have said he is the closest the series has to a typical hero so may seem bland in that regard but a character like that does have its place i do really like him in the books so this episode did a good job in bridging the gap between book jon and tv jon defeating styr this time without outside help in a pretty brutal manner did help but it was his general attempts to be a leader during the episode that really drove that forward "
"939" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " well we spent a lot more time with ned in season one so he superficially appeared to have more depth or at least to have more for a viewer to hold on to robb and jon are quite similar and i do think jon is more interesting than robb im aware i keep harking back to season one but i felt that both robb and jon were really well written in that season and i loved the wall scenes i think possibly that as the cast has expanded and the storyline grown more complex so theyve been served less well well obviously robb is dead but he was less well served for much of last season than he had been the first two i think its hard to juggle so many locations and storylines but and sorry for repeating myself i just think the wall should have been more prominent this season that battle should have a real emotional wallop but i felt more that it was fantastically shot but not quite as powerful as it could have been "
"940" "roganis" 2014-06-09 " i hope youre right and im wrong "
"941" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " i actually quite like all the jon defences no point in posing a question if you only want to hear one answer also it was a small moment but i cheered when jon gave edd the wall i love edd "
"942" "Empedokles" 2014-06-09 " one nice touch during the last phase of the battle was the sense of utter uselessness of the untrained noncombatant as evinced by sam and his steward mate in the midst of handtohand combat except for that one luck crossbow shot they may as well have stayed in the inside polishing the silver but it does beg the question of how a frontline force like the night’s watch desperately short of men could afford to reduce a substantial percentage of its manpower to essentially noncombatant status after all in all modern armies cooks and clerks may spend most of their time cooking and clerking but they are expected to grab a rifle when necessary and are trained so as to be able to do so i seem to remember that even the stewards were shown getting some nominal training but it was shown to have been very nominal indeed in this episode "
"943" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " no problem i like chatting about it not much point in writing this and leaving it hanging with regards to jon and the wall i think my problem is precisely because i dont think the storyline or jon is boring therefore i do think theyve screwed the pacing up a bit kit harrington is pretty much how i envisaged jon to be honest im not sure why i was quite so harsh on him writing this this morning frustration i think because i just feel that a couple more scenes earlier this season would have made all the difference the season one scenes at the wall were among my favourites "
"944" "Dewulf" 2014-06-09 " really interesting question id like to think so but couldnt say tbh i dont have a good enough awareness of what benioff and weiss are likesince i tend not to read many interviews etc with the creators or actors because when im watching i just want to imagine that world is real so the less i know about the people making it in real life the better "
"945" "bleudegex" 2014-06-09 " do you think hes got any less depth than ned or robb i think theyre very similar with jon being the most interesting of the three "
"946" "DesmondaMaree" 2014-06-09 " yeah a tantalising thought thinking back to when olenna was talking about the prospect of marrying a targaryen she told it like she wasnt terribly enamored she had other ideas but amon suggested he was pursued of course whomever each of their stories pertained to it was a long time ago people remember  or choose to tell  stories differently i dont read the books but it seems like there is a whole nexus of connections between characters that might only ever be hinted at thats what i like about it  lots of food for wandering and wild speculation "
"947" "BigTex" 2014-06-09 " i thought sam and gillys kiss was a highlight much more touching than jon and ygrittes goodbye "
"948" "Dewulf" 2014-06-09 " yep i see your point there  i didnt say it cos my post was long enough already but i think one thing missing was at least a scene or two with tywin or the like showing us exactly what their attitude to the impending doom at the wall was sure we can assume they just thought the nights watch would take care of it  but look at melissandres reaction to the warning that came by crow  so what about tywin what about the other lords who would have got that message also just getting back to jon i also agree the decision to try and meetkill mance unarmednot that it should make a difference seems a bit sillyhes not jaquen hgar or a ninja from the north pole they finished thormund and the thenns on their side of the wall which was really the most dangerous challenge  whats the problem with now just defending the wall from the top ok some more giants might get through the gateidk set up some massive ballistrae in the tunnelyeah i digress it just seems like jon is wearing a ton of plotarmor at this stage in the name of having some kind of manoamano with mance and i havent read the books  i just cant see him getting killed off right now  but hey you never know here do you "
"949" "Danko1981" 2014-06-09 " theres a brief moment in one of the s4 trailers that makes me think we will see tyrion in the last episode its a moment that i believe we havent seen yet "
"950" "Chivanova" 2014-06-09 " im not specifically referring to you  more to other blogs and reviews who call him boring without really justifying why maybe book readers understand or like the character more because we can have read his thoughts and understand his motivations i dont know how benioff and weiss could do this better on the show its probably just an inherent disadvantage the tv show has compared to the books thanks for replying btw  your interaction with people btl is commendable and many of us appreciate it "
"951" "DiamondDag" 2014-06-09 " a lot of other people saying what i feel about jon sorry to pile on sarah but i think hes been much improved this season kit as well he does suffer a bit in direct comparison to sam because john bradley is so perfect in that role and hes our connection to the story whereas with jon im not a bleeding poet is about as close to a joke as well ever get from him jons willingness to remove himself from his friends and step up to being a leader is actually one of the things i like most about the character "
"952" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " that would actually be completely awesome i would be completely impressed were that the case "
"953" "TheOtherInigo" 2014-06-09 " dewulf on your first very well said point do you think that the makers deliberately sought to divide the audience into those who understandappreciate the wall and its defenders and the uncaring rest of westeros that does seem to be what they have wrought and it would be strangely impressive if it was planned "
"954" "DisgruntledAmerican" 2014-06-09 " gee youve got a sixth sense "
"955" "ArjabSarkar" 2014-06-09 " but she almost had him twice and if not for the boy whose parents were killed by ygritte in front of his eyes it would have been a man dying in the hands of a woman ygritte living jon snow dying would have liked that better actually in retrospect "
"956" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " because sometimes when you have two and a half hours to watch something digest it and write it up you pick the wrong word in other words yep i should have said battle or attack "
"957" "Dewulf" 2014-06-09 " actually i thought they were kinda hidden a bit well jon was initially anyway behind some scaffolding over against the wall plus at the end hes kneeling down and by that stage thered be quite a few slumped bodies all over the placebut if it was in the middle of the bloody courtyard id be feeling the cheese yeah "
"958" "molari" 2014-06-09 " record scratch ser alliser is dead i think the fact they only showed him wounded and being dragged away is a good indicator the old curmudgeon is convalescing somewhere especially as he could have easily been killed on screen in his fight with tormund otherwise "
"959" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " mine too after all why should they have to live beyond the wall with the scary zombie baby thieves i think manse has a point "
"960" "aphrsk" 2014-06-09 " i had a very similar feelings after this episode the were moments in the beginning where i was thinking to myself yes sam loves gilly we get it plus some rather poorly written scenes ygrite and thenn sam and maester aemon comparing this to some brilliant dialogue in the blackwater episode cersei satnnis joffrey etc its all a bit below standard "
"961" "CentralBelter" 2014-06-09 " unbelievable posh and not just from stage school  shes a genuine scottish aristo "
"962" "SiobhanNIB" 2014-06-09 " why do you keep referring to this as a siege it was an attack a battle the castle was not under siege supplies and indeed people gilly were coming and going freely it may well turn in to a siege although with the wildlings from inside the wall now killed who would block that gate but it certainly wasnt a siege up to now "
"963" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " ah i like that suggestion a lot actually "
"964" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " i feel misunderstood much like poor jon snow  its not his inability to express himself i dislike  thats why i made a point of saying i like his northern gruffness  my problem is i think the character is generally less wellwritten you can be strong and silent and have depth im just never entirely convinced that jon has any although i do accept ive been a bit harsh on him just not for the reasons suggested "
"965" "ArjabSarkar" 2014-06-09 " yes i completely agree with that in fact the wall never had the extravagance of the other story lines their locations nor the characters who are able to pull of half an episode on their own lying on the margins of westeros and comprising only of the marginalized people of the land its bastards alleged rapists petty thieves and the likes the happenings in the wall has somehow escaped the mainland westeros and its creators as well like you noted i feel sad for the characters sacrificing their lives without the rest of the world coming to know about it even the wildlings have my sympathies really "
"966" "Drgonzo123" 2014-06-09 " its seems the biggest complaint is that we care little about the black watch and are too disconnected from the characters we care less about who lived and and who died i think that is the point the men of the nights watch are constantly on guard for the entire westeros yet no one gives them a second thought unless giving out punishment everyone is preoccupied with the events in king landings the characters in the show and the viewers at home "
"967" "mensurrat" 2014-06-09 " jon snow a northern orlando bloom or a recycle and easier version to digest of acchilles "
"968" "bleudegex" 2014-06-09 " have you seen rose leslie do an interview in real life shes literally the poshest person i have ever seen fair play to her for doing a decent northern accent "
"969" "Chivanova" 2014-06-09 " i like jon snow hes getting a lot of flak for this ep but tv critics seem to forget that there are actually people in existence who are actually quite stoic and not given to expressing their feelings via extended monologues and john bradley was superb tonight samwell has always been a favourite character for me and i thought he provided nuances between the action really well i feel as if the wall  beyond story so far has been a long setup for what will transpire over the next few seasons  which i think will end up being one of the stronger storylines although there are certainly drawbacks the great thing about there being so many characters and threads to the show is that if a few lose their way there are others which can provide the necessary drama to keep people interested and the story going "
"970" "CentralBelter" 2014-06-09 " i know people have been critical of rose leslie but spend a few hours out in manchester on a saturday night and you meet plenty of women with exactly that come over here if you want some ybastardnarkiness  i thought she caught that and her vulnerability very well and as for her death i dont mind having a moment like that in the middle of a battle scene especially in an episode that was all about love including the love of giant for giant by the looks of it "
"971" "bleudegex" 2014-06-09 " technically that is a spoiler unless you say that every week "
"972" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " no we saw him fall but not die although he didnt look in great shape so i supposed doom isnt quite the right choice of word but im not convinced many people got out of that "
"973" "bleudegex" 2014-06-09 " now you mention it he just got beaten up a lot and fell of a balcony so he might still be alive but he didnt carry on fighting after that "
"974" "DiamondDag" 2014-06-09 " it was absolutely the right thing for the story grenn was the perfect fit its just such a shame weve lost a couple of characters that made castle black feel so alive "
"975" "hazh" 2014-06-09 " did we see alliser thorne die i must have missed it "
"976" "Ernekid" 2014-06-09 " the best action scenes ive seen since the lord of the rings films a lovely bit of hackn slash action the theory that the only nice people in westeros are the fat lads hot pie and sam still holds as a book reader im really excited for next weeks episode is that a spoiler "
"977" "DiamondDag" 2014-06-09 " yeah i found myself much more engrossed in this this episode than the battle of blackwater i think they managed to build the sense of doom a lot better the stakes felt a lot higher the contrast between slynt and thorne was fantastically realised also they both share a desire to hold power at castle black which sets them against jon and his allies but thorne being a soldier through and through it would never be at the expense of defending the wall i mean the guy was downright heroic in that battle the action itself was great only minor quibble being with all the cgi in that episode they couldnt stretch to ghost having a bit more presence in the fight they made a fuss about sam getting him free and then we barely saw him the nerd in me just wanted to see an image of jon standing with ghost at his side facing down some wildlings ah well in terms of how they ended it they didnt play things out how i expected feels like they have a lot to pack it for the final episode "
"978" "roganis" 2014-06-09 " except according to wikipedia got s04 tyrion is only appearing in 7 episodes this season and guess what he has already appeared in 7 methinks his fate has been penciled in as the blockbuster opening episode for s05 next episode is called the children i think well be seeing more action north of the wall in the finale httpenwikipediaorgwikigameofthronesseason4cast "
"979" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " oh i didnt mind it theyve always had the cheesiest moments  the climb to the wall the cave so i just buy their relationship that way and went with it despite the obvious cliche of it i can be quite sappy at times "
"980" "thegurge" 2014-06-09 " i was half expecting a squadron of dragons to come save the day "
"981" "dsk84" 2014-06-09 " i understand the part with grenn donal noye wasnt included in the show so to feel the impact of his sacrifice and bravery it had to be one of the named members of the watch grenn pyp and dolerous ed with grenn being the bravest and most likely of the lot to do what he did it kind of had to be him it was still sad to see both grenn and pyp go though  "
"982" "aphrsk" 2014-06-09 " interesting to hear your reaction to ygrittes final moments personally i couldnt get past the supercrigeworthy tv cliche of a woman dying in mans arms in the middle of super violent battle while all the fighting blurs in the background slow motion ofc suddenly no one bothers them just for enough time to say all the proper goodbyes totally got me out of the moment i think this show deserves better "
"983" "mentalvortex12" 2014-06-09 " yes elder brother of her great grand father "
"984" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " arggh yes good point about ghost wish id thought of that "
"985" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " fair point and i also liked jon and ygritte and was a bit weepy when she died my real issue isnt with jon  though i appreciate the blog is a bit harder on him then id realised  its that i think this storyline has got slightly short shrift when it most mattered in contrast to last season which was immaculately paced i think this season could have benefitted from another couple of episodes either that or less filler with other stories when this one needed more care "
"986" "roganis" 2014-06-09 " well always have the cave "
"987" "NobbyNolano" 2014-06-09 " for a few months ive argued that the wall was the weakest and least engaging part of the show i found that i couldnt warm to either harington or bradley as jon and sam but they proved me wrong in this episode from start to finish it had me hooked and the gamble paid off to dedicate the infamous 9th episode to the wall everything was pretty much spot on for me sams coming of age and finding of courage was a particular get in son moment and the way he softened his tone when talking the little laddie was heartwarming deserves to win every award under the son and i cant quite believe this was achieved on television "
"988" "roganis" 2014-06-09 " i think if i was going to fight through 100000 wildings to get mance rayder i wouldnt be leaving my direwolf behind but that apart i thought this episode was great first fist thump moment  sam kissing gilly second one  jon wacking the thenn with a hammer "
"989" "MurrayOstril" 2014-06-09 " that continuous crane shot after jon came down in the cagey thing was incredible  top stuff from neil marshall "
"990" "TheOtherInigo" 2014-06-09 " great great uncle i believe "
"991" "Empedokles" 2014-06-09 " this was a strangely even perversely lifeless and bloodless episode despite all the hacking and slashing nothing much actually happened or at least nothing i found at all gripping a lot of time and footage wasted on confused scufffles between nearidentical looking men and a woman in enclosed confused surroundings a lot of waffle too between jon and sam about sex between ygritte and the wildings about killing jon between sam and gilly about nothing much altogether too much sam in fact while jon still looks and acts like a rather wet artschool undergraduate the whole wall scenario has in fact ground to a nearhalt the really interesting thing about the far north and the wall is of course the white walkers and they have been put on hold for far too long in their absence i would argue that the wall doesn’t deserve anything like an entire episode all in all and i hate to say this probably the weakest episode of the entire 4part series to date "
"992" "SirGideonSkiddMarkke" 2014-06-09 " yes i understand that but climbing the wall with a thousand men and attacking along the top of it aphrsk surely they do know thats how tormund et al got over "
"993" "ArjabSarkar" 2014-06-09 " read my comment slightly above about jon if youd care but i totally agree with you "
"994" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " i buy him as a leader actually and i think ive in retrospect been a bit unfair about him but i am frustrated about the wall scenes this season that siege is so crucial and horrible and sort of sad and i would have happily lost a couple of meereen scenes or held them over to next season to get more emotional impact last night that said i thought the action was brilliantly shot "
"995" "dhulmes" 2014-06-09 " totally agree too technically the episode was brilliant  probably just as much as blackwater but by the end of the episode blackwater felt significant whereas this felt like a minor if extremely bloody and exciting skirmish a couple more scenes earlier in the season may have made all the difference  even more preferably one with mance rayder who finally looks set to be back in the next episode on the other hand i do have a soft spot for jon snow  far more so than dany whos probably the only other traditional hero of the story "
"996" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " you do realise that i have to write this blog from a tv point of view without putting endless book knowledge into it right i know not everything has to be neat and tidy some ambiguities however work better on the page than on screen in my opinion "
"997" "bleudegex" 2014-06-09 " does anyone know what relation he is to daenerys "
"998" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " i like your jon defence and nice points re the wall scenes i feel a bit bad about jon because i do actually largely enjoy his scenes and ill be honest got a bit weepy when he shared his final moments with ygritte i suppose my problem is that i think the wall storyline has all this potential and i really liked what we saw of it up until this season and this season its just felt like it should have been prominent in order for this episode to really hammer their sacrifice home "
"999" "maclau1" 2014-06-09 " i was taken by how similar this felt to the siege of gondor kept asking my son who has finished all of the books when the rohirrim were going to arrive still not sold on the storyline "
"1000" "ArjabSarkar" 2014-06-09 " contrary to the article i like jon snow as he is hes not supposed to be an ordinary character like sam we can relate more to sam because we are more likely to be like him in that situation hes a much more modern character in fact one of the most modern characters in the show a man who is more likely to haunt the library of the wall and in times of trouble think logically with a bit of fear thus taking wiser decisions jon on the other hand would just walk into a suicide mission because he thinks it would be the best thing to do in that moment and he is revered by sam for exactly that and ygritte loved him for his naive courage and nobility and it bought a tear to my eyes when she died the two of them were the best couple in the series imo  "
"1001" "aphrsk" 2014-06-09 " but im not convinced by the wildlings strategy hundreds of miles of wall guarded only at a few places but they dont know that that was the point of killing deserters at crasters so they cant be captured and interrogated to expose that night watch has only 1 really functional castle and little over 100 men "
"1002" "bleudegex" 2014-06-09 " youd think they would have found the massive gap that bran and co went through last season "
"1003" "SarahHughes" 2014-06-09 " yes  in season 2 i think it came up before they left to go beyond the wall "
"1004" "MaximumToilet" 2014-06-09 " has maester aemon said he was a tagarayen before "
"1005" "dsk84" 2014-06-09 " also what are the odds the woman he was talking about was olenna she might be a bit young but it really would be perfect if it was her "
"1006" "Gantsara" 2014-06-09 " the hobbit films are shite total travesties "
"1007" "bleudegex" 2014-06-09 " i think jon snows character seems to be exactly the same as ned and robb they seem to have the exact same character traits and obsession with honour and doing the right thing although i find jon a lot more liekable than ned and robb "
"1008" "David Flynn" 2014-06-09 " whose going to deal with tormund was allister dead wasnt he just wounded and dragged inside fallen doesnt necessarily mean dead and chicken or not as far as we know only sam is aware of the fact janos ran off and he still ranks higher than john not matter what the other brothers might think "
"1009" "dsk84" 2014-06-09 " yep they have children and older people with them so they wouldnt be able to climb the wall pretty much have to smash through to let the rest of them follow behind "
"1010" "thepresident99" 2014-06-09 " surely jon snow has to conquer danaerys if you catch my drift "
"1011" "shambala" 2014-06-09 " that was better than the hobbit films "
"1012" "Dewulf" 2014-06-09 " for what its worth i have no problem with how the northern story has been handled  in a way the wildling threat is put in a place at the back because thats exactly where it is as far as the westerosi nobles are concernedand yet every scene with them so far has told us how hard their task was going to be cant mount an expedition against the wildings successfully taken out by white walkers cant get back home succesfully split apart by the rebels and the lack of support from craster cant intelligently talk about the defences icing the tunneland so on also got no problem with jon and the way hes portrayed hes a stoic guy in an age when guys were supposed to be superstoic i dont need him to be showing me the inner workings of his soul to be involved in his story two dimensional hes the bastard son of a lord whos constantly trying to contribute the knowhow that he can whilst being put down etc but was clearly torn to some extent when abandoning ygritte hmm maybe hes better in the books he seems fine to me as the character he is "
"1013" "bleudegex" 2014-06-09 " i thought it was a fantastic episode id forgotten how much i liked jon sam and co i agree with sarah that theyve bodged the wall storyline this season the friendship between the brothers of the nights watch should be one of the best bits of the show but weve hardly seen anything of them recently ygrittes death was predictably cheesy pip and grenns death made much more of an impact and with alliser thorne now dead does that mean that jon will be the new leader of the nights watch assuming he gets out of his meeting with mance alive he seemed to have already taken on that role in this episode and didnt his uncle used to be leader "
"1014" "TheOtherInigo" 2014-06-09 " i like jon snow both the character and the portrayal i dont find him twodimensional at all just reserved and unshowy much like ned stark hes doing his best in a bad situation he has wit but displays it rarely which is i think what keeps some of the audience from connecting with him hes not as easy to love as witty characters with hollow souls like bron or jaime in a fight however i would choose jon at my side every time id never have to watch my back ygrittes death was moving deserved and telegraphed to be by ollie the second she coldbloodedly murdered his father without warning i liked the episode a lot but i am devastated by the demise of grenn and pyp "
"1015" "FinFaceSplitter" 2014-06-09 " you do realise the things jon snow isdoing are from the book right the wall wont be missing next season not everything has to be neat and tidy "
"1016" "Gantsara" 2014-06-09 " can i just say i thought danaerys was great in this episode "
"1017" "molari" 2014-06-09 " i think the slightly underwhelming feeling a couple of people have spoken of irl not just online is as sarah notes the result of underinvestment in the northern storyline over the past few seasons contrast with blackwater in season 2 where time had been spent building up both stannis and the lannisters prior to the siege having said that i think the criticism of jon snuh is a little harsh as this was probably kits strongest showing to date and i actually bought into him as a leader men would follow rather than a stroppy bit of eye candy not sure the tragic ending with ygritte they were going for worked so well as this pairing hasnt had enough time together for me to care that much that shes dead griping aside this was a wonderful almosthour of tv with better cgi than most movies some great character moments especially from alliser and really super action shots "
"1018" "dsk84" 2014-06-09 " that really was some episode invariably there will be comparisons towards both the battle of the blackwater and to how it compares to the book to the latter without going into spoilers i pretty much understand why those changes were made and felt though largely worked well even if the ending seemed unfinished i really do wish the episode was longer but that is pretty much my only complaint back to the comparisons with the blackwater episode i felt that was a slightly better episode but this battle was far better one of my cousins told me he was glad the good guys finally won it being the episode right after the very notion of the good guy coming on top was crushed definitely had a strong impact a lot of viewers would have that lingering doubt over whether the nights watch would be able to pull it off or not  in the long run that still remains to be seen but against all odds they held for now some really heroic moments  in particular alliser thorne who may well be a right bastard but the type of bastard who is made for situations like that people seemed to have the impression that while he is thoroughly unpleasant he does have the good of the nights watch at heart and he certainly did show that in particular when he admitted his mistake to jon and similarly it was obvious that janos slynt had no redeeming qualities at all a bully when things are going well and a coward when things arent but cannot forget poor grenns sacrifice it was another character who filled his role in the books but for emotional impact it worked well here just imagine trying to convince not only yourself but 5 others to hold when a giant is charging at you there were a few real standout moments in terms of action  the giant firing an arrow to the top of the wall the massive ice scythe and the badass cook with that cleaver the episode reminded me a lot of the battle of helms deep from the the two towers but to see something like that on tv was very impressive im not sure if im really sad to see ygritte go but here death was well done and was fairly touching im now left in two minds though anticipating next weeks episode incredibly eagerly but at the same time dreading it as it means no more game of thrones for another year "
"1019" "PlumRadio" 2014-06-09 " i think their goal was not climbing the wall but going through the tunnel nice mammoth "
"1020" "DesmondaMaree" 2014-06-09 " in the midst of such a fierce episode from the spectre of a looming siege to the bloody fighting i loved that love was an anchoring theme the old blind maesters speech and his idiom that love is the death of duty i couldnt help thinking that duty is also the death of love but sam whose his selfconfessed cowardice is dwarfed by the angels of his braver and better nature was the hero of the hour "
"1021" "PlumRadio" 2014-06-09 " yes there was one long shot at the battle of the south wall that was quite impressive "
"1022" "ArjabSarkar" 2014-06-09 " they should have stayed in the cave "
"1023" "SirGideonSkiddMarkke" 2014-06-09 " i agree the scythe of doom was great but im not convinced by the wildlings strategy hundreds of miles of wall guarded only at a few places and they choose to climb where its most heavily defended a thousand men atop the wall twenty miles down surely "
"1024" "penny0604" 2014-06-09 " i agree with sarah that this episode would have had greater impact if wed kept up with the wall a bit more pip and grenn were great characters we just havent seen much of them recently it looked amazing though especially the 360 view from inside the castle walls fighting on all sides "

"1027" "DiamondDag" 2014-06-09 " grenn and pyp of all the changes i theyve gone too far this time sobs "
"1028" "PlumRadio" 2014-06-09 " too much fighting and not enough politicking in this episode oh well the real tragedy one episode left before a 9 month wait for new ones help "
"1029" "ScotiaNova" 2014-06-09 " next episode is 66 minutes long so plenty of time to wrap the season up    "
"1030" "dsk84" 2014-06-09 " i loved how he gave jon a nod pretty much saying dont worry mate i had you covered all the way but really he was the one person jon could not feel any anger towards for doing what he did "
"1031" "dsk84" 2014-06-09 " my cousin was telling me that she read a comment in an a song of ice and fire fanpage that the thing someone was most looking forward to in this episode was hearing that for the last time "
