"14" "UncertainAgain" 2013-05-24 " mroneill  exactly its not about the us being uncomfortable with nudity and almost completely about the world market the laws on nudity vary by country but in the us theres no prohibition against nudity and sexuality other than sexualizing minors with nudity but got goes world wide and the show has worked nudity into the exposition so completely that if local airings cut scenes with nudity it would cut the threads of the plot in fact my understanding of showing the penis is that the uk specifically prohibits the penis dangling at a more cocked angle than the resting state pun most certainly intended perhaps that is just the bbc and over the air channels other nations are more prohibitive my own personal take is that those who demand the show justify nudity are simply abusing the term and concept of justification the show has naked people because it is more illustrative in the scenes where it happens its not the actors who are being exploited it is us with our inevitable reactions and we are glad to be and pay money to hbo to be exploited "

"24" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-05-24 " what of the great cgi device of the others  referred to as white walkers in the tv series last previously seen in the season 2 finale these are just as impressive as danys dragons imo at the end of episode 8 hundreds of crows filled the nearby tree screeching wildly a white walker or other approached when sam attacked it with dragonglass it howled in pain as its whole body froze from the point of impact it fell and shattered leaving just white dust and the dagger which had become freezing cold the crows flew out of the trees and chased sam and gilly tv got wiki nonspoiler stuff here mentions that the white walkers are a mythological race mentioned in ancient legends and stories from the time of the first men and the children of the forest eight thousand years before roberts rebellion a winter and period of darkness known as the long night lasted a generation in the darkness and cold of the long night the white walkers descended upon westeros from the farthest north the polar regions of the lands of always winter none knew why they came but they killed all in their path reanimating the dead as wights to kill the living at their command eventually they were defeated supposedly by the nights watch in a conflict known as the war for the dawn and the wall may have been raised as a defence against them the white walkers are supposedly not heard of again and became regarded south of the wall as nothing more than fairy tales to frighten the little children so in the present day most believe they never existed and are held to be the stuff of myths and legends spoken of in the same breath as ghosts goblins grumpkins and snarks even the few who believe they did once exist think that they must have become extinct thousands of years ago but there is a growing belief amongst wildlings living beyond the wall that the white walkers have returned what is known about themthe white walkers are taller than humans and gaunt with flesh pale as milk and icy blue eyes deeper and bluer than human eyes burning like ice as bright as blue stars and as cold they are humanoid but with wispy white hair and pale white skin stretched and gaunt the skin seems dry and wrinkled giving them a mummified appearance a wight will also possess icy blue eyes when resurrected by a white walker white walkers possess the magical power to reanimate the dead as their servants known as wights men who fall in battle against white walkers must be burned or else the dead rise again as their thralls white walkers wield weapons that have thin blades made of extremely sharp crystal they wear reflective armour that shifts in colour with every step and appear to be superior swordsmen wielding thin crystal swords said to be so cold as to shatter any object they touch including the steel blades favoured by the nights watch the sword of the white walker that samwell tarly slew gleamed with a faint blue glow the white walkers go lightly on the snow and leave no prints to mark their passage their movements can be lighting quick the wildlings believe the white walkers and their wights can smell life or rather its warmth there are tales of their riding the corpses of dead animals such as horses they are also said to ride ice spiders and speak a language known in myth as skroth at the end of season two sam sought refuge behind a rock whilst a white walker appeared leading a horde of wights the white walker saw sam but ignored him riding past him on an undead horse and leading the horde towards the fist there was a complete redesign of the white walkers between the early concept in season 1 and the fully revealed version in the season 2 finale the final version introduced at the end of season 2 was closer to how they appear in the books some differences remain in that white walkers are said to wear much more armour in the books made from a strange reflective metal that almost acts like camouflage the white walkers in the books are described as gaunt but the tv ones dont seem to have quite so much of a mummified appearance they are said to have an otherworldly icy beauty to them and grr martin has confirmed that the white walkers are not dead just an inhuman kind of life not unlike the barrowwights of tolkiens middleearth they play tricks too mance rayder referred to them as always the artists in his comment in a previous tv show scene on their habit of arranging the bodies of the dead into patterns "

"40" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-05-23 " from wiki in response to a question regarding his own religious views grr martin replied i suppose i’m a lapsed catholic you would consider me an atheist or agnostic i find religion and spirituality fascinating i would like to believe this isn’t the end and there’s something more but i can’t convince the rational part of me that makes any sense whatsoever that’s what tolkien left out — there’s no priesthood there’s no temples nobody is worshipping anything in the rings in a 2011 interview he added none of us entirely escape the values that we’re inoculated with at an early age even if we reject them — like me leaving catholicism on the sex scenes he said one of the reasons i wanted to do this with hbo is that i wanted to keep the sex we had some real problems because dany is only 13 in the books and that’s based on medieval history they didn’t have this concept of adolescence or the teenage years you were a child or you were an adult and the onset of sexual maturity meant you were an adult so i reflected that in the books but then when you go to film it you run into people going crazy about child pornography and there’s actual laws about how you can’t depict a 13 year old having sex even if you have an 18 year old acting the part — it’s illegal in the united kingdom so we ended up with a 22 year old portraying an 18 year old instead of an 18 year old portraying a 13 year old if we decided to lose the sex we could have kept the original ages and once you change the age of one character you have to change the ages of all the characters and change the date of the war that dethroned the mad king the fact we made all these changes indicates how important we thought sex was "

"43" "jimmy_mac" 2013-05-23 " ntofr1  i’ve not read any of the books in short my answer to your question is yes melisandre is using stannis and she is using gendry and she is using beric and thoros in my opinion as far as her spiritual devotion goes if she is not misrepresenting the character of the lord of light but is sincere in her service to him then that deity is actually the devil or an evil god of some sort as evidenced by her use of stannis to sire her evil spawn ghost baby that murdered renly i prefer to think that she is practicing black magic and is only using the cover of acting in the name of “the one true god” in order give her evil practices legitimacy but who knows maybe the one true god of the world in which the game of thrones is being played out is evil and melisandre is a devoted disciple i prefer to think not i prefer to think that perhaps ned stark’s old gods which seemed to be more honorable and noble might be better worshipped even beric who has been resurrected from the dead six times apparently in the name of the lord of light has said that there is no “other side” beyond death but only darkness i think he himself may be wondering whether the name “lord of light” is a misnomer thus i see support for the position that melisandre is an actual devotee of a religion albeit in my view one that worships an evil god accordingly while i understand the suggestion that the lord of light may be a complex deity that is both good and bad noble and ignoble virtuous on the one hand murderous on the other i disagree with it a god like that is no god at all to my way of thinking "

"371" "JohnDear" 2013-05-21 " pepa01  i think the reason dario says it is simply because in the coin game the game to choose who kills dany the braavosi coin is the winner and braavos is unusual in that it only has one god and that god is death so the death coin is the braavosi one why melisandre and thoros said it as a greeting last week i dont know in the books its a phrase specifically associated with braavos "

"377" "BaronVonH" 2013-05-21 " singist  at that moment i was wondering how many of those crows had wargs behind their eyes viewing the proceedings since the crows dissipated before the slaying of the white walker any wargs that were watching only got part of the story "
"378" "grandcanalman" 2013-05-21 " agree about dany not my favourite pov in the books but this series emilia has played her really well helped as well by the early reveal of barristan and his dynamic with jorah at this rate i could put up with a whole series of the meerenese knot "

"386" "DiamondDag" 2013-05-21 " enjoyed that a lot more than last weeks effort much much better the focus on fewer locations really helped cerseis little chat with margaery was rather chilling wasnt it i was surprised that cersei would so openly threaten margaery like that i guess shes just reached the end of her patience and doesnt want to play nice any more lenas delivery of the whole thing was great really the whole wedding story was brilliant brutal funny and uncomfortable viewing peter dinklage got to take centre stage but it helped that it brought together a lot of of the strongest characters and actors i think sophie turner is doing fine with a character that is supposed to be completely out of her depth but she isnt really drawing me into sansa how long can she and tyrion hide the fact that they arent sharing a bed danys story also continues to be great to watch possibly the most consistently strong story of the whole series love the casting of daario that smile i think jorah might be turning green soon dany seems to be sweeping everyone aside with complete control 2000 men added to her army and daario in her pocket doesnt look like yunkai stands a chance have to agree with sarah that those crows were a lot more unnerving than the actual white walker still not convinced by their old man look doesnt work for me suitably creepy when kept at a distance glowing eyes and all poor sam the slayer seems to be getting some grief for leaving the dragon glass yes hes not stupid but hes definitely a coward i think its fair to say after that encounter hed be so terrified hed just want to grab gilly and make a straight run for the wall without taking time to think the only slight wobble in the episode was at dragonstone with the rather cheesy seduction of gendry by melisandre unfortunately ever since neil marshall revealed how an exec producer pressed him to add nudity to the blackwater episode i cant help but look at scenes like that with a cynical eye but it was interesting that melisandre didnt end up killing gendry not sure whats in store for the poor lad but perhaps davos can keep him alive now that stannis has released him from prison its clear that stannis views davos as his conscience he has doubts and needs davos to express them i wonder how melisandre is going to react to a dissenting voice although i dont think shes ever been openly hostile to davos i cant imagine shell want davos to keep meddling its a bit cruel that we have to wait 2 weeks now for episode 9 which is usually the episode where everything goes to hell "
"387" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-05-21 " anonnyscouse  i cant justify last weeks talisa scene to me that was about demonstrating the strength of robbs commitment to her all the comments he made i love you and i cant concentrate whilst youre naked etc the juxtaposition was that all she has brought to the party aside from a bum view was that she claims to be pregnant and mysterious and seems to be rather a sly seductress if thats not too strong a description she was clearly confident remaining naked whilst he tried to work i surmise that shes a strong and fairly ironwilled character "

"395" "MRONeill" 2013-05-21 " redcat21  haha  no he is not funny  funny looking arguably sure which is one of my larger gripes in the casting  i simply do not find him attractive in the least but he actually seems to take on a role of the fool in kings landing  hes easily manipulated as olyvar and twyin found out and clearly the butt of our jokes  as you said cersei was funny in their scene loras was funny in the scene by the fountain with sansa  but unintentionally so weve seen him s1 i believe win the joust against the mountain but that was because he rode a mare in heat and then the mountain hacked off his stallions headto me one of the hardest to watch scenes in the series and we saw him ride into the battle of blackwater wearing renlys armor so is he respected in westeros probably its arguable whether this glory was actually earned  but who in westeros actually deserves accolades received and who receives accolades when they are due not tyrion not jaime and yes i realize that im arguing with my own original point here one of the many reasons i love this series "

"431" "Drewv" 2013-05-21 " redcat21  funny i meant that in a more literal sense a productionside sense though and less as a criticism of the plot it just didnt occur to me before but clearly this actor troupe has been walking around the very same piece of irish woodland all season "
"432" "Ninnyhammer" 2013-05-21 " thenorthremembers  trying to extend the logic you have put forth if the primary correspondence between robb and stannis have been through catelyn would it mean that her proclaiming that robb is the king in the north would in turn force stanniss hand to claim the death that although far fetched would mean that catelyn has effectively destroyed her sons and as a result the whole of the campaign of the north first letting jamie go thus incurring the wrath of the karstarks and weakening the military might of the north and now making a mess of a diplomatic visit thus ensuring that her king faces eminent death "
"433" "anonnyscouse" 2013-05-21 " sarahhughes  i think that was linked to his mention of his erm little tyrion at the party he was trying to put sansa at ease a bit with a joke as the full line was long you have a long neck "

"447" "Cosmonaut" 2013-05-21 " xellothe   danys nakedness served to emphasise her physical vulnerability in that particular situation and established her relationship with daario on rather more er sensual grounds than it otherwise would have been the great thing was that she maintained control of the situation despite her nakedness daenerys doesnt overplay it but she is aware of her sexuality and is aware that it can inspire loyalty probably one of the lessons she learned from her interactions with ser jorah mormont lord of the friendzone i did first think that she didnt need to give daario a fullfrontal view and that it was a sign of weakness but in retrospect i think it was exactly the opposite she has got herself another loyal puppy "

"907" "MoreTears" 2013-05-20 " sarahhughes  sure but there is a reason why they are not showing a game of thrones episode on memorial day weekend this year hbo didnt pause for that holiday last season or the season before that and those episodes ended up being the two lowest rated episodes of their seasons  which means that the lowest rated episode last year was the spectacular blackwater episode moreisless above is correct that ratings dont really matter much to hbo since they dont have any ads but they do like to keep their subscribers happy and hbo probably sees the past ratings dips as a sign that at least a good number of their subscribers who follow gto are doing other things on memorial day weekend "

"967" "seeknsanity" 2013-05-20 " watching cerseis scene this week it is not hard to see where joffrey gets his cruel streak the woman is the epitome of evil queen though i am surprised margeary did not have a sly retort and was basically left with dropped jaw yes sansas performance was much better this episode now that i have thought about book sansa she was actually proactive i trying to escape kings landing that whole plot was taken out of the show so it makes her appear weaker than what she actually was next season will likely focus more on yunkai and dany i do like the set up lead in to it in this episode though i was hoping for a belwas with the introduction of ser selmy sigh and daario is aryas jacquen davos is the brotherly relationship that stannis never really had with his two actual brothers i adore it i do hope that is as far as melisandre will go with gendry is it possible to leach someone to death and was that joffreys leech that exploded in the fire how fragile and hopeful did arya look with the hound she just tugs my heart the crows the weirwood tree the white walker that scene was awesome bran and the threeeyed crow the godswoods children of the forest religion practiced by the starks warning sam that a ww was en route if only sam hadnt stepped over the knife he had just used to kill the ww "

"970" "ciwstudent" 2013-05-20 " what i have found one of the most interesting aspects of got since the shadowbaby scene last season is the quastion of stannis ethics in the got universe his actions are considered dishonourable and somehow cheating however he killed one person renly how many people yould have died had the battle gone aheadin this episode a similar problem is brought up is it unethical to kill one person to save millions of othersi find it fascinating because my emotional rection is that yes it is unethical to use shadow babies to kill unwitting leaders and that of course its unethical to burn likeable characters on the other hand the shadowbabyassassin probably saved the lives of many innocent people who would have been slaughtered in battlethe main difference of course between renly and gendry being that renly chose to oppose stannis and potentially cause bloodshed whereas gendry was minding his own business and got dragged into it does anyone else have thoughts on this "

"986" "MRONeill" 2013-05-20 " as always excellent blog sarah i thought this week was one of excellent performances  laughing out loud at cerseis cruelty makes me wonder is she losing it a bit surely there must be consequences for threatening the life of her future daughterinlawsisterinlaw perfectly played in return by margery continuing the smiles across the room excellent to have davos back although sarah i didnt see that davos won  only that melissandre was doing some sort of miniexperiment to show davos the necessity of taking more all of gendrys blood while i think dany ishas come into to her own as a queen remaining excellently composed throughout the cringeworthy scene with mero  there was a trace of the old sansa present in her easy acceptance of daarioperhaps to remind us that she is in fact just a young girl the brief scene with the queen of thornes was amazing i love that shes willing to jibe anyone even her own kin peter dinklage as always was wonderful his drunkenness could be viewed as over the top  but i think its representative to his character  sansa needed to put on her armor he did too the glimmer of married life was comical  tyrion spilling on himself sansa clearly annoyed but pretending not to be tyrion remaining a gentleman in the end serves to highlight our twice monthly reminder of how utterly evil joffery is im glad to hear constant reminders from people that have met jack gleeson what a nice kid he is  because he truly plays a revolting psychopath very convincingly "

"996" "dsk84" 2013-05-20 " chinofjim  yeah i really like davos always so honest and forthcoming even if he knows it will get him in trouble a bit like ned stark in a way though not quite as naive  he is a former smuggler that rose to be the hand of one of the kings so you cant be naive and do that yes i know ned was also a former hand but he was noble born and that king was his best friend from when they were youths whereas davos earned the respect of a much sterner man and stannis certainly has the sense to constantly ask for davos advice cause he knows how much sense he makes "
"997" "Idil" 2013-05-20 " it was nice to see davos back on the scene he is the voice of common sense and reason grounded in reality it is a pity we did not see stannis daughter it seems she managed to teach davos how to read i wonder if he can also write hound is doing the decent thing by taking arya to her brother and mother even though i am not sure if his only motive is money there is a good guy in hound that comes out in times of crisis joffrey was cruel as always tyrion the perfect drunk gentleman i felt bad for tyrion when joffrey took away the steps it should be one of the most awkard weddings in history he also managed to threaten sansa with rape in her wedding i really loved tyrions threat god knows joffrey deserves it more than anybody certainly more than theon sansa did not show her relief she managed to hide it i also felt bad for tyrion but i guess she was just being honest the look between shae and tyrion was priceless when she realized he had not bedded her sam made a big mistake by leaving the blade behind i hope this oversight does not cause too many deaths why were there so many crows or ravens there did they come to warn the couple they also followed them when they were running away why i am disappointed in danys choice in lovers they should not have dressed dario like fabio it cheapened the scene and anything that would follow did he look a bit like the guy who can change faces am i making this up i think she trusted or seemed to be trusting dario very fast more than the occassion would warrant imo i wonder what loras was trying to tell cersei before he was rudely cut off poor gendry i wonder if one can die from leeching slowly i guess they can if so would it be preferable to be killed instantly still gendry may have a chance to escape in the future i missed brienne and jamie jon snow and the traveling stark boys next week we will have all the other weddings i guess too many couples marrying at the same time this week was about second sons next week weddings none of the weddings i have seen in got was joyous so far no reason to expect ones in the near future will be any better i guess "

"1001" "Cosmonaut" 2013-05-20 " dsk84  though having mentioned sams big scene it is interesting how long ago they mentioned the dragon glassobsidian spear tip i have read the books so i got its significance then but i wonder if nonbook readers would have at the time a couple of weeks back when sam showed it off i referred to it as chekhovs gun  i think it was pretty clear he was going to use it against a white walker at some point wasnt expecting him to run off and leave it behind though "

"1003" "singist" 2013-05-20 " those crows were 10 times more frightening than the actual white walkers a that scene was straight from the birds olaygriund scene gotta love a hitchcock reference "
"1004" "dsk84" 2013-05-20 " cosmonaut  yep in fact when he started running after he stabbed the white walker i just assumed i was towards the dragon glass instead he was running away from it i doubt it was a continuity error cause you could clearly see it on the floor as they run off so hes definitely going to regret it "
"1005" "Idil" 2013-05-20 " cosmonaut  he did not pick it it was a large oversight and mistake on his part what was he thinking leaving such an important weapon behind "
"1006" "TheNorthRemembers" 2013-05-20 " cosmonaut  am i right in thinking that sam didnt bother picking up the dragonglass knife and instead just ran we know why sam left his crucial weapon behind when he ran away  because he had just one job to do to kill the other "
"1007" "ChinofJim" 2013-05-20 " i loved the scene between stannis and davos the way the scene was framed it was made almost to look as if stannis was behind bars as much as davos and stannis being more of prisoner than davos was the subtext of their conversation  stannis saw the images in the fire and so is compelled to believe in the lord of light even though it compels him to do things that deep down he knows to be dodgy davos in comparison is not in thrall to any religion it is just stories you tell your children and so is free to follow his conscience so free in fact that he he is not scared to lose his own life to do what he feels to be right "
"1008" "dsk84" 2013-05-20 " i got home today from work and went about acquiring the latest episode for both got and mad men in a manner than isnt entirely legal dont judge i buy the blu ray box sets when they come out and before heading off to the gym i capped the upload limit so that id be sure theyd both be done by the time i came back i returned and it seemed to be taking forever about an hour later i realised i had capped the download speed rather than the upload speed serves me right anyway onto the episode i definitely thought it was one of the stronger episodes this season a lot of story building parts but at the same time some really big moments  none bigger than sam the slayer though though having mentioned sams big scene it is interesting how long ago they mentioned the dragon glassobsidian spear tip i have read the books so i got its significance then but i wonder if nonbook readers would have at the time likewise there were so many moments in this episode which appear to be foreshadowing something far larger despite knowing what happens part of the thrill is actually seeing the hints and watching it all play out in front of you the tyrionsansa scene was very uncomfortable but despite tyrion being completely smashed he retained his senses and acted in a very decent manner to sansa throughout first sparing her the incredibly humiliating bedding procession then not actually sleeping with her even though it was clear that he finds her quite attractive and it was very clear that he was quite hurt when she asked what if i never want to sleep with you i really did feel bad for him the titans bastard was hilarious i thought krazyns was horribly misogynistic though amusing but mero was even worse he was openly saying whatever he felt in the common tongue rather than ghiscarivalaryian daario is an intriguing character though will be interesting to see how dany and daario interact and after seeing dany in this episode if i dream about her dragons again but not her there is something seriously wrong with me "

"1013" "DeleteThisPost" 2013-05-20 " cosmonaut 20 may 2013 336pm i saw that too he did just run off and leave that thing which did annoy me more than a little bit since it reminded me of every episode of macgyver ive ever seen in which mac defeats one bad guy and then runs off without the guys gunknowing there are more bad guys around though ill give sam a break since macgyver never had to stab a disintegrating undeadthing and then run off into the freezing cold the worst mac ever had to deal with was a balding thug in a members only jacket "
