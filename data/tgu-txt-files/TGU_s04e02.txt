"2" "tomaszzaraza" 2014-04-20 " that reminded me of the caesars statue in life of brian "
"3" "tomaszzaraza" 2014-04-20 " how about red viper as a killer after all lannisters are not the only ones who pay their debts "

"5" "pdboxer" 2014-04-19 " have you rewatched it there is it and sopranos normally i do rewatch things but i am almost scared that i wont enjoy them as much second time round and spoil my beautiful memories of them that i am nervous about watching them again plus there are big series out there i still have to get to such as mad men and 24 "
"6" "pdboxer" 2014-04-19 " its definitely up there id say i have a top 4 of absolutely top drawer shows and within that 4 sopranos and battlestar galactica are my two favourites then there is the wire and breaking bad its difficult to say which would get third place between the wire and breaking bad they are such different experiences "
"7" "ashbrighton" 2014-04-19 " of course joffrey didnt suffer enough  i think in the book his suffering was more protracted so i think the producers missed a trick in not giving us enough joffpain as to weddings in got being about misery not pleasure does that make got the eastenders of medieval fantasy drama  finally who votes for jaime and brienne getting together "
"8" "NZerDan" 2014-04-19 " khal drogo killed his blood of his blood with his bare hands and is definetly the most dangerous on the edge character in the series to date  "
"9" "NZerDan" 2014-04-19 " yeah that face in the ice was interesting think it will be big series for bran and his gang "
"10" "NZerDan" 2014-04-19 " cant see how on the tv series unless he pops up next week and claims the iron throne cos the red woman told him who daddy was that would be hilarious "
"11" "NZerDan" 2014-04-19 " arya is thought to be a lot like lyanna quite wilful rhaegar took her at sword point which was out of his character by all accounts but some girls just dig that though huh "

"17" "Sunburst" 2014-04-18 " judging by george martins intelligence and maturity im pretty sure this is exactly whats going to happen "
"18" "KatharineP" 2014-04-18 " yes i know – it makes it very hard to rewatch it knowing what its leading up to brilliant journey though to get there "
"19" "pdboxer" 2014-04-18 " i was obsessed by battlestar galactica if only i could wipe the last half season or so from my memory and especially the last episode but it was absolutely terrific tv for a long time i agree 100 i would go as far as saying if it wasnt for the last episode or the whole nonendingending it would be my favourite show of all time because for long periods it was better even than the sopranos but the ending was so bad it not only sullied the last episode  last season its awfulness reverberated back through time like some awful shockwave and sullied my memory of all the good episodes that had gone before yet even with that its still in my top two shows ever along with the sopranos "
"20" "pdboxer" 2014-04-18 " mostly they relax with a stiff drink and a cigarette from about 1000 am that would work just as well "

"22" "pookiesu" 2014-04-18 " tywin was clearly to be seen forking something to his mouth from a plate in the whole pie scene was it pie or was he still finishing off the previous course "
"23" "pookiesu" 2014-04-18 " and it is quite a cty programme so its hardly inappropriate never heard so much casual cting on tv "
"24" "pookiesu" 2014-04-18 " the book cersei is even more of a hardfaced bitch than on tv theyve softened her up quite a bit  made her more multifaceted eg  in s1 where she says she did love robert at the start  grieved for the loss of their baby in the book she says she always hated him  aborted their child "
"25" "pookiesu" 2014-04-18 " this is about the worst of the possible outcomes i have envisaged  the series winds up with a zombie apocalypse showdown that can only be beaten by dragons fire i will be so disappointed "
"26" "pookiesu" 2014-04-18 " eloquently put and it would be sad if you werent to grace this blog again as many others have said sadly the graun is far from the only sinner in this regard the independent app version at least deserves special dishonourable mention for its disgraceful clickbait behaviour  an endless series of got articles accompanied by spoiler photos  even spoiler headlines and then vaguely hoping to remedy it by including spoiler alert in the article text too bloody late matey on the front page too ive resorted to an illicit viewing of s4 episodes so far just to keep up with all the spoilers if anyone asks tell them irresponsible journalism is killing tv "
"27" "Molerat" 2014-04-18 " i like the way pod did a double take at the bendy female entertainer at the wedding like he had met her before "

"29" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-17 " i would think that a bank that cant call in its loans wouldnt do all that well "
"30" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-17 " its a bit tricky to compare because they have different strengths ser barristan is getting a bit old i think he says that he would beat the other men in the kingsguard at one point but on the other hand it is clear they arent much to write home about at 60 he is about 20 years beyond the date when most men are considered past serious fighting the mountain is described as being immensely strong his armour is so thick it gives a lot of protection and he has a good fighting instinct on the other hand although he is supposedly fast for his size it isnt that fast and he is stupid ser loras says that he is not as good a swordsman as his brother garlan but is a better lance the hound is described as being very fast and also very strong on the other hand thoros defeated him three times in tournaments with his flaming sword i dont know whether jaquen is a particularly talented swordsman at all oberyn uses poison so that could be considered an edge or cheating hard to say anything about the others except dario is so annoying i hope he loses in the end i think the answer is you cant really rank people that way in any really objective way it depends on their relative strengths the circumstances and so on "
"31" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-17 " they simply stopped reproducing successfully the last ones were runted and died before they got as big as they have in season 4 its implied that it is in some way connected to the loss of magic more generally "
"32" "chriskilby" 2014-04-17 " but was it snow or ash snow definitely this was more apparent when dany had the same vision "

"36" "pdboxer" 2014-04-17 " from what i know of the shows you like i am not sure mad men is for you do you watch banshee that strikes me as something you would enjoy thats because you know i like things like homeland and 24 though right but i also love things like the west wing borgen and house of cards which can be quite slow if thats what you mean never heard of banshee but will look it up right now "
"37" "pdboxer" 2014-04-17 " i have a confession to make which im not too proud of i havent really seen the sopranos beyond a few episodes i was a bit young when it first started and too into my video games to really get into episodic tv shows i know a little bit where you are coming from my problem with sopranos was that i was working a lot of night shifts in those days and on my evenings off i was training be it playing football or kickboxing the only tv i watched in those days was football twice a week and probably a couple of comedy shows per week still the furore around sopranos was so great that when i got in from nightshift it had already started but i would flick it on i had no sky plus to record it in those days but only ever caught 15 mins of it here and there which always seemed to be tony talking to his shrink or arguing with his wife boring i actually then thought i had made a mistake and that it was not about the mafia at all and stopped watching it altogether then a couple of years back i finished the wire thought it was great and my mate said if you loved it youll love the sopranos youve got to watch it so i started from episode 1 and loved it breaking bad is probably third on my list after game of thrones and mad men though everyone has their favourites i am not a big fan of the killing which is widely loved whereas i love homeland and battlestar galactica which are not loved so widely "
"38" "jodave" 2014-04-17 " loved the episode but wanted the whole thing to be the wedding party so the build up to jofferss death would have been even better the romantic in me wants brienne and jamie to get it together "
"39" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-17 " not at all they are just able to wreak absolute havoc from the air where no army or lone knight can get anywhere near them and move fast enough to evade the weapon technology of the day "
"40" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-17 " but jez do we know this from the tv series alone thus far the mountain fair enough anyone badass enough to cleave his own horses head off must be worthy of a wide berth i agree ser barriston has a fearsome reputation also but his bus pass era looms surely  particularly as cast but as for oberyn randy bi man with some big cojones yes  but have we been told  seen anything re his actual fighting prowess "
"41" "Jez Holland" 2014-04-17 " syrio jaqen is not a 1 on 1 fighterso it would be barristan then the mountain with oberyn in third "
"42" "Moreisless" 2014-04-17 " next thing you are going to tell me is that they are armourplated as well and cannot be killed "
"43" "bleudegex" 2014-04-17 " its normally quite civilised and spoilerfree here but i think this episode brought all the morons out of the woodwork im even convinced that there are a lot of people pretending they havent read the books in order to slyly give away secrets "
"44" "malevoisine" 2014-04-17 " reek it rhymes with chic brilliant "
"45" "malevoisine" 2014-04-17 " bugger that joffrey had plenty of chances the king can do as he pleases and all that still he probably wouldnt get excited by a woman he wasnt allowed to fill full of crossbow bolts first s "
"46" "Nick Anderson" 2014-04-17 " i think "
"47" "JanfransZuidema" 2014-04-17 " the books are only relevant if the makers of the series decide to follow them i believe that the makers of the series are making up their own mind the fun thing to do is to mess with the expectations of the readers im sure that the makers will not ignore this possibility to amuse themselves "
"48" "JamesWMoar" 2014-04-17 " arent dragons coldblooded  in this story theyre very hotblooded if you can actually apply a scientific concept like that to a fantasy  the books mention somewhere that they give off heat to the point that they steam on cold nights "
"49" "Moreisless" 2014-04-17 " arent dragons coldblooded  north of the wall they would not be very effective at anything other than sleeping "
"50" "chriskilby" 2014-04-17 " how did the dragons get wiped out originally more to the point who wiped them out the stuff of legend perhaps but it is known surely by tyrion arya and every other child in westeros who has ever read about dragons can still see an allpowerful bran wargging the dragons into frying anyone he likes  lannisters white walkers smug spoilerholic types with big mouths hellbent on ruining the show for those of us who havent read the books yet  "
"51" "chriskilby" 2014-04-17 " i totally forgot about the nasty wee raper who bullies sam all the time and stabbed mormont in the back you know the one who looks like ricky gervais rast is it the douches douche he should be top five at least "

"54" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-17 " mmmmmmmm maybe so but im sure that tywin tyrion et al are more than a little worried about the gravity of the threat as was robert before them "
"55" "chriskilby" 2014-04-17 " doucheros "
"56" "Moreisless" 2014-04-17 " if it breathes it can be killed i am sure tyrion and a decent maester will devise a dragonkilling strategy "
"57" "CavalierDisregard" 2014-04-17 " actually in the books its not 100 percent clear you suspect but no one comes out and claims the deed or explains how it was done actually it is the person who is responsible tells the person whose chapter it is explicitly ive not long reread that chapter so its still quite fresh in my mind "
"58" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-17 " it means stannis will be as grumpy as ever and will as ever listen to the red woman but you are right westeros  kings landing will need to draft in ser george of house osbourne to clear the nasty little balance of payments deficit run up by the slippery littlefinger otherwise the iron bank will come a calling "
"59" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-17 " one on one combat fairynuff they might have a spot of bother adhering to the many codes of chivalry but out on the battlefield they have no equal do they "
"60" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-17 " whathey are westeros wmds arent they just ask harren the black was it he got well  truly toasted and harrenhall had a very abrupt makeover courtesy of some very decisive weapons surely personally i think they will carry some serious clout in any upcoming battle stakes "
"61" "Moreisless" 2014-04-17 " no dragons please i have started to think that the dragons are not the decisive weapons in the upcoming battles for westeros when danaerys eventually gets there "
"62" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-17 " oh i think viserion rhaegal  drogon might just come one two and three dont you "

"64" "jameslondon58" 2014-04-17 " there is a difference though between someone pointing something out because they noticed it when they watched the show and someone giving advice as to what are clues and what are red herrings because they have already read the books in this case we dont know but further down this thread are comments from people stating who or who didnt kill joffrey and what clues were visible in this episode and it was based on their knowledge of the novels and not any deductive powers i realise though that fans of the books and show will come on here to chat about all things games of thrones and some get a little excited about what is about to come up and love to hint this to others because they get that thrill of knowing something that others dont "
"65" "CaptainBlack" 2014-04-17 " i really wanted arya to do him with her toothpick in the final episode now weve lost the best bumfluff moustachetwirling villain "
"66" "rickyredmanc" 2014-04-17 " you have a point actually walda does westeros would make an interesting got spin off i agree more rubenesque ladies would make an interesting change "
"67" "MoreTears" 2014-04-17 " from what i know of the shows you like i am not sure mad men is for you do you watch banshee that strikes me as something you would enjoy "

"69" "Rini" 2014-04-16 " thanks yes its all coming back to me now "
"70" "cajking" 2014-04-16 " careful now apparently pointing out things that were clearly visible on the screen is considered a spoiler this is why i have little sympathy for the spoilerphobes "
"71" "davidjones2492" 2014-04-16 " all of the westerosi houses follow the male line of succession girls can inherit only if there is no male heir except in dorne which follows the eldest child regardless of gender the only complication to this in the past was the targaryns who followed the male line of succession but i think some of their kings were polygomous "
"72" "davidjones2492" 2014-04-16 " i heard a rumour theyre looking to cast her for next year and i think the rob stark dwarfs face was never shown so she may yet appear "
"73" "greenwolf99" 2014-04-16 " intrigued to know what this means for stannis now irrespective of whether someone at the wedding poisoned joffrey stannis will undoubtedly believe his demise is as a direct result of melisandre and her dark arts will this give him the impetus needed to regroup and build an army for another assault on the lannisters his belief in the new gods will also be strengthened even further and what about the iron bank clearly the lannisters have a huge amount of debt which they cannot pay  hence their reliance on the tyrells to pay for the wedding feast what happens if the iron bank call in their debt if indeed they can  does the iron bank have any sort of power or can the lannisters who always settle their debts simply refuse to pay all building up nicely for future episodes "
"74" "SharpMango" 2014-04-16 " sarah  i know about free speech and all that but for tv blog guidelines perhaps writers such as yourself should be given leeway to delete offending posts id also advise book readers that there are specific blogs out there designed for discussing got vs the books once again its worth pointing out to everyone that everyone who watches got can read we just chose not to read the books and enjoy the show "
"75" "davidjones2492" 2014-04-16 " no the books so far cover much more than a single year if you think about it bookseason one alone starts with jon arryns death which prompts the royal court to go to winterfell a trip of at least a month after that there is the return journey presumably the same length of time so the first 2 episodes of the show alone cover a period of at least 2 and a half months after that daenerys becomes pregnant and goes close to a full term in her pregnancy at the same time robb calls the norths banners marches 20000 men to the riverlands and breaks the kingslayers armies remember westeros is huge about the size of south america it takes time for people to get from a to b its difficult to keep track of time on the show because there are less hints about the passage of time and it doesnt show long trudging journeys the subsequent booksseasons may well cover shorter time periods than the first but we are still talking many months for each in the second season an entire campaign is being fought in the riverlands with a 2nd major lannister army destroyed by robb as well as numerous sieges of castles in the riverlands i would estimate by the end of the latest book your looking at around 3 years give or take passing since the start of the series in westeros time it s somewhere close to 2 years at the current stage in the show "
"76" "chriskilby" 2014-04-16 " that sounds like a euphemism "
"77" "James Gabb" 2014-04-16 " pay careful attention to sansas necklace "

"80" "realstokebloke" 2014-04-16 " no worries it was as lemony snicket would have it a series of unfortunate events i guess  but underlines the grr i really wish i hadnt just been told that moment that is so often complained about mostly by you of course   "
"81" "chriskilby" 2014-04-16 " seconded and carried "
"82" "bluefinch" 2014-04-16 " i cant help but think that ramsays girlfriend will one day end up like the girl they were chasing the two women blonde victim and dark archer were the same two who teased theron before his mishap in the last season "
"83" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-16 " hey im sorry to hear that  i dont do the links well i do sometimes but i didnt for this one but i know what youre referring to and im sorry "
"84" "pdboxer" 2014-04-16 " i wouldnt mind something a bit slower i have also started watching season 2 of 24 and it is at the other extreme generally i like shows where every now and then the characters relax and have a cup of coffee which helps me relax too "

"87" "pdboxer" 2014-04-16 " thank you this seems to be the consensus and when i think of other great shows i am glad i watched them from the start so those are your two favourites eh have you watched the wire sopranos breaking bad etc "
"88" "pdboxer" 2014-04-16 " i have heard some fans say it maybe got a little stretched yes but then even the almighty sopranos my joint favourite ever show along with battlestar galactica suffered from that a bit in season 5 "
"89" "chriskilby" 2014-04-16 " looked like a white walker to me possibly the white walker hinting that bran can warg the undead maybe even control them now if brans fledgling wargging abilities ultimately stretch to controlling dragons as well that makes him potentially the most powerful character of all and its game over as far as the iron thrones concerned unless hodors at it of course all that hodorings just a big act and hes the rightful heir to the throne and the ultimate badass "

"91" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-16 " being farther along has its ups and downs i think overall i think i prefer it  there are things which seem not to make sense in the show which do in the books mostly because you know what people are thinking i suspect if i had seen the show first i would be annoyed that they didnt make sense on the other hand it stinks to know something you are not looking forward to is going to happen it is like reading it again for the first time "
"92" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-16 " it was clear that rheager took off with another woman what was somewhat less clear was whether she went willingly or not "
"93" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-16 " apparently she was quite lively i think neds older brother liked a laugh too "
"94" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-16 " i am hoping they will include more of walda if they arent going to give us any naked men at least we could get a break from all the skinny ladies "
"95" "KatharineP" 2014-04-16 " also one of my favourites im more excited about the new season than about got but it could hardly be more different from either got or bb – another world altogether and a slowmoving one as bb can be in its own way of course i dont honestly think it would make much sense starting from this season – the characters the dynamics between them and the office politics have been slowly built up and developed over the course of the show it might be possible to grasp the plot but my feeling is the nuances would pass you by and its a show that depends on nuance though last season was a little more heavyhanded thematically than it needed to be at times "
"96" "jameslondon58" 2014-04-16 " i only ever go on this thread after i have watched the episode and i knew that something big had happened but had to wait until tuesday night before i could watch it however coming on here still seems to provide spoilers even though i am now up to date as people who have read the books simply seem incapable of keeping that information to themselves this forum is about the tv show it is in the tv section of the newspaper and is following the pace of the tv show as shown in the uk time and time again people like to prove to the world that they discovered something before everyone else and it became mainstream "
"97" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-16 " well they replaced the old tommen with an older boy "

"100" "jameslondon58" 2014-04-16 " ill miss joffrey i though jack gleeson was fantastic whenever he was on screen and was the best evil character in the show i always looked forward to his scenes to see just how nasty he could be the moments between him and his uncle at the wedding were great and you could feel the tension rising its a shame that gleeson wont be doing any more acting seeing his shy polite pleasant real self in striking contrast to the monster he played showed that he had great talent "
"101" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-16 " however the book version seemed more popular with the crowd it even read as being funnier i thought the five kinds version on tv was not only in bad taste it was kind of a lame performance "

"181" "EdPrior" 2014-04-16 " yeah thats what i think one of the main objections people have about the rlj theory is that its too obvious but i think thats because the people who sit around discussing this stuff are probably the people whove spent way too much time rereading and obsessing over these books i include myself in that group once youre looking for it theres quite a lot of circumstantial evidence for the theory arguably a bit too much or so some people think so they suggest it might all be a red herring personally im pretty much convinced that rlj is correct as its the only thing that makes sense and would be narratively satisfying in my opinion i agree they will have to make more of the history though for that to make sense and feel satisfying for tv people if we start seeing lots of flashbacks to roberts rebellion next season i would not be overly surprised in terms of the various storylines i think if they want to keep a decent pace most of the major characters have enough story to keep them going until the end of season 5 but i think bran specifically could run out of story by the end of this season if they stick to the books there were very few bran chapters in adwd if memory serves i think he will get to the cotf and br by the end of this season "

"327" "Lingli" 2014-04-15 " i totally agree about tywin  which is why i wouldnt bet on him stepping in to exonerate tyrion either i should add that ive recently finished the books but havent rewatched past season lately so i may be drawing on a different dynamic from ones that gotwatchersonly have in mind i think not only would tywin get rid of whomever he felt was in his way he also hates and despises tyrion  because his birth caused the death of his mother tywins wife because tyrion is a dwarf because tyrion married one unsuitable woman and brought another back to kings landing because tyrion is smart and smartmouthed so i fear that the future looks very bleak for him the other thing i thought when i saw tommen at the feast was that he seemed quite old  i dont really know how much time is supposed to have elapsed since ned and his daughters left winterfell but when tywin galloped into the great hall after the battle of the blackwater cersei was holding tommen on her lap and he looks way too big for that now "

"333" "Malkatrinho" 2014-04-15 " i think the pie was poisoned not the wine this makes a lot of sense and more clearly ties in with the tyrell theory it is certain that joffrey would be first to taste his celebratory pie so to speak with margaery even helping to make sure he got a decent serving and that no one would touch it after hed croaked im sure oleanna is thrilled at cerseis intervention in pointing the finger at tyrion because as she loudly told everyone on many occasions the tyrells were supplying all the food and drink so suspicion would naturally have fallen to her my reasoning as to why tywin is also involved is because why would oleanna take the risk of removing her familys link to the throne unless she already had a deal lined up with him for the next in succession "

"342" "Malkatrinho" 2014-04-15 " got to disagree re tywins thoughts on joffrey tywin is the coldest most calculating of characters and he would have foreseen many problems with joffrey continuing on the throne more than likely ongoing war as he continues to antagonise and insult the major families of westeros and as has been raised previously war is expensive and the kingdom is already heavily in debt in other words joffrey is a current and worsening liability who must not be allowed to compromise tywins plan to establish a lannister dynasty in westeros in the books joffreys younger brother tommen is portrayed in greater depth and as being the polar opposite of the recently deceased king in terms of temperament and likeability so hes less of a forgotten cipher like he is in the tv shows kind of surprised there wasnt a the king is dead long live the king moment right at the end "

"464" "taurus69" 2014-04-15 " fantastic summary thanks "
"465" "digit" 2014-04-15 " of course the first real culprit is melisandre because she threw the three leaches full of kings blood on the fire one of which was for joffrey its been pretty obvious since the same trick worked on robb stark that joffreys goose was cooked "
"466" "digit" 2014-04-15 " or maybe tywin and olenna cooked up the plot together in fact maybe the seeds of the plot were in olenna and margaery questioning sansa about joffrey and finding out that he was a monster "

"565" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-14 " she does have a motive hes a psychopath also shes the queen and it cannot be undone so i guess tywin will want her to marry another lannister asap the younger brother we actually saw a few glimpses of him this episode the spare seems inoffensive for now anyway shed have a better chance at influencing tommen than joffrey so thats motive enough having a less insane lannister as a husband the alternative for tywin would be to have her killed but then the lannisters dont have the money for another war specially against the rich tyrells so i think margaery will probably marry tommen so yeah reading through the comments im pretty convinced now the tyrells killed teh king hurrah "

"625" "candylilacs" 2014-04-14 " does it reduce their claim to the throne they have no claim except by marriage so nothing is really lost here plus that alliance is based on moneywealth not love loras still gets to marry cersei and i doubt margaery will be lonesome for long twice a widow already "
"626" "candylilacs" 2014-04-14 " well theyre all aging faster in the series than in the books because the actors are people aging in real time i think the four books are only supposed to cover about a year i think in the books joffrey was 14 when he married margaery although in the series he appears around 1718 daenarys is supposed to be about 15 or 16 and obviously in the series she looks to be about 1920 i think arya is still about 10 or 11 in the books and shes easily 1314 in the series so the series will make things a bit different than the books because of that which is ok i think its just getting harder to pretend arya is a boy because in that last scene she obviously had a figure especially when she belted the tunic "

"642" "EdPrior" 2014-04-14 " yeah that makes sense as long as its done in a natural way that fits the story rather than just become a lazy way to do exposition "

"645" "elleesse" 2014-04-14 " gosh yes youre right perhaps shes just not been able to get into that inner sanctum of power and get close enough to her but dead on  that scene was totally required its certainly the first thing brienne would do find sansa and tell her all re falling in love with any man im guessing from what little backstory we have of brienne that she never fit in didnt conform to the girly wearing a dress that her father wanted and everyone immediately mentions what a massive big lump of a girl she is and laughs at her aspirations to be a female knight so bearing that in mind it would make sense for her to fall for any man who was even slightly kind to her and jaime did save her life and did respect her swordsmanship i love this story toohope it continues on this series feel like the bran out of window part of jaime could be somehow softened by him being with brienne "

"656" "MRONeill" 2014-04-14 " great last scene  impressive wedding set and costumes etc all around despite some theories of others i think two things are clear 1 joff was poisoned like sarah im no doctor but i dont think choking to death causes blood to leak from your orifices and 2 cersei couldnt have killed joff she was maybe the only person that would have preferred him alive that said i bet she regrets sending pycelle away not that it wouldve made a difference this may be me reading too much into things but joffs crown during the weddingdeath  the stag horns bc hes a baratheon seemed to be intertwined with rose buds tyrell  but it seemed to me that those buds were choking the horns thats my theory and im sticking to it i thought the glance between oberyn and loras was nothing much more than a yep were gonna have sex later on you mind if my bastard girlfriend joins us glance and not necessarily the beginnings of an alliance i get the sense that loras isnt smart enough to make allegiances although his verbal betterment of jaime was impressive it made me laugh regardless the scene between jaime and tyrion was beautifully done for the record ill always appreciate a reektosausage scene transition  but it was incredibly heartwarming to see the two brothers interact its just wine and tyrion dumping his glass out on the tablevery telling of his true character as someone thats been mocked his entire life to immediately try to make jaime feel better about his new disability ramsey ramsey ramsey someone suggested that well miss joffery because there are so few completely evil or good characters in got  never fear ramsey will gleefully take joffs place the similarities between joffs horrendous murdering of ros and ramseys girlfriend skewering that poor girl cannot be missed  id forgotten ramseys penchant for hunting girls from the books and it was truly horrible to watch reek is doing a great job  the anguish on his face when learning of robb i missed the hound but we did get a hodor i cant judge the bran scenes yet  i liked the weirwood tree video montage it made me intrigued for the future of that storyline we also got some stannis  i think the look on melisandres face towards his crazy wife couldve been one of and people think im fanatical and not surprisingly for me i hope shae got on that ship and its the last we see of her although i doubt it  with all due respect to sarah i thought her acting in that scene was nothing short of really really poor to end on a light note finally seeing mace tyrell and olennas dismissal of him and fat walda made me smile "
"657" "Spacedone" 2014-04-14 " so i take it my game of thrones themed wedding idea is probably going to go down badly i was looking forward to the roast boar as well  best line of the episode went to ser loras jaime if you were to marry cersei shed murder you in your sleep if you somehow managed to put a child in her first shed murder him too long before he drew first breath luckily for you none of this will happen because youll never marry her loras and neither will you boooom "

"661" "Malkatrinho" 2014-04-14 " yes it would have been totally out of place but having joffrey stumble around choking and falling into the buffet table and then a couple trays of broken glassware has a certain appeal i would have liked it even better if right at the end a giant comedy anvil with acme stamped on the side of it fell out of the sky and squashed him flat "

"700" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-14 " they know some of it i think but not all but if i recall correctly in the books we get a good bit of that story right in book 1 and some more i think in book 3 so they have managed to go a long time on the show without passing that stuff on maybe they dont plan to "
"701" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-14 " i apologize i wasnt trying to give any spoilers i just thought it was a reasonable assumption that the mother of joffery was the least likely suspect whereas someone like lady olenna has a more solid motive "
"702" "JanfransZuidema" 2014-04-14 " great episode my guess emma peel did it she made this small nod to tyrion and it would make sense her being an avenger "
"703" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-14 " great points i do sometimes forget that with martins style of writing you are reciving information based on that characters point of viewwhich may or may not be reliable but based off the events that occured on screen you can make a reasonable assumption to person or persons who were involved in his death albeit not the one who specifically did the poisoning like you said though its still conjecture at this point and there are plenty of unanswered questions personally as a casual viewer i would not have noticed the hints most likely until i have rewatched the episodes once or twice reading a storm of swords made it significantly easier to pick up on those hints that i would have otherwise missed which is what i was refering to in my earlier post "
"704" "rickyredmanc" 2014-04-14 " olenna would of agreed with the action of poisoning joffery one would suspect anyway but as ive already said somewhere my money is on the spider "

"706" "Aelfwine" 2014-04-14 " personally i always thought the white hair sounded silly and distracting though it did at least give occasion to that ridiculously sad thought from theon  a stark at last  ha so im glad they didnt do it i guess they could have emphasised his frailty and ill health more but really its mostly about allens performance and hes doing just fine in my opinion "
"707" "MrFabJp" 2014-04-14 " maybe she believed him and will want to take revenge "

"710" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-14 " its not olenna youre waaaaaaaaaaay off the mark thinking it was cersei would be way off the mark lady olenna not so much "
"711" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-14 " very true twyin is the true power in kingslanding its very hard to imagine ser dontos as the mastermind behind killing joffery he may have played a part in it but he is definately working forwith someone "
"712" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-14 " ive read the books as well but i dont take anything for granted you cant always trust what has been stated in the books because a lot of the revelations in martins books were really conjecture on the part of the characters  and they may have come to wrong conclusions a good example of that and were well past this point so it isnt a spoiler for anyone who hasnt read the books is the speculation of who hired the killer to come after bran tyrion figures out that it was joffrey and were left with the idea that it probably was but since that idea comes solely from tyrions perspective and since were not given a godseyeview of the events we have to take tyrion at his word but whos to say he was right the same idea goes into who poisoned joffrey even if we think we know based on the books that doesnt mean that we actually know so yeah ive read the booksbut i still cant say that i know who killed joffrey "

"716" "sydneysider28" 2014-04-14 " i think most of the tyrells have a motive for murder they obviously want to be in control olenna is my favorite suspect although varys dontos sansa tywin and margaery all could have been invlovedthe cup was under the table and handled by different people and the wine jug itself may have been poisonedother people ate the pie though plus it wasnt just joffrey upsetting people cersei did her best as well "
"717" "Owakahnige" 2014-04-14 " perhaps and i was just thinking that it doesnt really matter who is queen because tywin is the real power behind the throne and i cant see him giving that up so if it was the queen of thorns then she is playing a longer game another contender is the clown dude the one that sansa saved from being killed by joffrey the one who gave her the necklace last week he whispered to sansa to leave just when joffrey snuffed it strange that they put that little scene in maybe he did it "
"718" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-14 " please correct me if im wrong but isnt margaery not queen since the marriage was not officially consummated the bedding ceremony just like the marriage between renly and margaery was not official "

"722" "Owakahnige" 2014-04-14 " aroused pity when least expected you have to be kidding we were letting off party poppers i have no idea how they did it but i have little doubt that olenna tyrell did the deed the old maxim who gains comes to mind and now margaery is queen "
"723" "zombiedeadhead" 2014-04-14 " back to making porn at which she was also spectacularly good "
"724" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-14 " her work in that industry was prolific to say the least i dont think she made too many porn flicks  just a few i believe though that didnt stop the german press from lambasting her once she got into mainstream work "

"726" "CStars" 2014-04-14 " im glad this was done so early in the season and it was the episode where joffrey was at his absolute worst humiliating others and abusing his power the lannister family is an interesting one tywin and cersei sit by while tyrion is routinely humiliated by his nephew albeit one who was king but tyrions warmth in dealing with jamie was touching jack glesson made a terrifying boy king who had not a shred of remorse for any vile thing he did but i suppose he is a product of a completely spoilt upbringing in the first and second episode we saw young starks and lannisters who are prepared to kill others if they are deemed enemies as for joffrey i felt no pity for cersei or her dead son joffrey was a complete monster but a great character for the show another piece falls and hopefully this will be the season where the characters dont seem too distant from the proceedings the wedding was excruciating to watch as we saw how powerless others can be in the game duty and power rule without reservation also did anyone think tyrion actually meant what he said to shae he loves her but he can never be openly with her in a formal union because of their backgrounds the frustration in his words was heartbreaking and the next few episodes will be tough for him considering hell most likely be imprisoned i think the scene between him and jamie foreshadows an alliance of sorts between the two at kings landing varys wont and cannot openly defend tyrion neither can sansa but jamie can "

"728" "16ghostly" 2014-04-14 " i dont really understand why it was too difficult to dye alfie allens hair white when roose asks what ramsays done to him it seems less a statement of disgust than a legitimate question but then again they took away every single distinctive feature of the roose bolton character as well so i guess i shouldnt have expected much "
"729" "jasonsmith88" 2014-04-14 " im really going to miss joffery "

"731" "swisschocolate" 2014-04-14 " i totally agree  when they got to bran i just groaned i find that whole warg thing and the threeeyed crow tedious beyond belief could have done without dragonstone too that scene added nothing new the long wedding scene made me realize just how great it was to have one long stretch of plot with the same people intermingling for a while and not the constant jumping around to different locations "
"732" "dsk84" 2014-04-14 " yeah cersei was annoying me greatly from deciding to send the leftovers to the dogs to her incredible smugness during joffreys wedding at least tywin had the decency to try and cover his amusement briennes confession by silence was unnecessary  i sort of enjoy her relationship and while it does make you question where its purely platonic or is there some underlying sexual tension it wasnt something that needed addressing i actually though jamie was offering advice to loras until he said but you wont be marrying my sister but loras actually for once managed to put someone in their place after being an idiot throughout the series "
"733" "Jez Holland" 2014-04-14 " i remember during season 2 i believe that a minor celebrity in the us announced they were going to have a game of thrones themed wedding i chortled at this at the time knowing what i do from having read the booksnbsp i do believe someone should have taken the happy couple to one side and had a quiet wordnbsp i do wonder if they look back in that day now and speculate on whether it was a wise theme "
"734" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-14 " im pretty sure she was wearing something though i cannot double check at the moment eitherway based on the shows previous track record this is hardly anything worth mentioning "

"738" "dsk84" 2014-04-14 " i was planning on playing rains at my cousins wedding but despite watching the show he barely knows the characters names so he probably wouldnt have recognised the song and id just end up looking like a fool thanks for all the suggestions everyone to make matters more interesting someone from my past so to speak has asked if she can be invited i really should say no now "
"739" "aliquidcow" 2014-04-14 " im surprised they got to this scene so early into the season still it was well handled  just like in the books martin gave us the death we wanted but probably not the way we wanted it i think we all hoped he would die in a way that felt like he was getting his comeuppance  killed by sansa perhaps  but no he dies suddenly and confusingly martin very cleverly turned what could easily have been a satisfying death into a frustrating one "
"740" "EnglishDisco" 2014-04-14 " i really dont think youve followed the series too closely it definitely isnt cersei  the only redeeming feature apart from her cheekbones is her love for her children "
"741" "dsk84" 2014-04-14 " not sure if theyll take this route but id really like to know what happened at the tower of joy during roberts rebellion the reed kids know and i feel that may explain jon snows history but that may not happen till later "
"742" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-14 " tommen was in a shot but as usual he wasnt there to actually do or say anything i actually hadnt realized tommen was in the episode until you said something i didnt even remember what he looked like was he the one next to tyrion who was sniggering at the dwarves during the reenactment of the war so who actually killed joff they have definately laid out some subtle hints between these two episodes enough that i believe you should be able to form a solid conclusion as to who the culprit was of course i read the books so i sort of knew what to look for "
"743" "dsk84" 2014-04-14 " finally ended up watching it a bit later than id have liked but was worth it in the end i suppose the episode could be divided into what happened in kings landing and everything else that happened outside the kings landing scenes other than the one with tyrion and shae which wasnt necessarily bad and it was obvious what tyrion was doing it just didnt resonate too strongly with me were all outstanding the ones outside were a bit mixed the first one with ramsay was a bit disturbing though that is obviously the point the second one where reek was shaving ramsay was quite clever for a bit it looked like he was a bit afraid of his dad but he quickly turned it around and showed how in control he actually is brans bit was pretty short but it reminded me of why of all the arcs in the books it is probably my least favourite its obvious that its important in the grand scheme of things its just not sure when that will manifest itself or when it will even get interesting dany at least has dragons bran has what  hodor stannis moral compass seems a bit confused  he was willing to free davos because he knew he would do the right thing and stop the murder of someone related to him yet when he burned his brother in law he pretty much dismissed his concerns as if they werent there anyway back to kings landing the first thing ill say is im now certain ill miss joffrey certainly more than i miss robb stark there are plenty of somewhat noble northerners in the show but no one quite like joffrey he absolutely turned the vileness up several notches and that peaked with the mock war it was interesting to see who was amused and who was disgusted by it especially seeing mace tyrell joining in the amusement despite the rest of his family being less than impressed he is certainly the buffoon his mother said he was it was also good to see loras finally having a good line after over 3 seasons when jamie tells him he wont be marrying his sister and he responds by saying neither will you it was easy but amusing none the less as per who killed joffrey i think i remember who killed him from the books but my memory is somewhat hazy the episode did such a good job with little giveaways as to who might have done it that i am getting doubts and will refrain from checking up to see who it was "
"744" "Jez Holland" 2014-04-14 " nope he was and still will be remembered as being the vulgar name for a lady part "
"745" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-14 " what i want to know is what the hell are they going to do with bran after this season i heard some speculation that bran could be a great way to introduce important history and other information into the story i would agrue the scene this episodethe vision when he touched the weirwoodcould quite possibly add some weight to this theory "
"746" "jimmy_mac" 2014-04-14 " i agree ramsey snow was a little overconfident i thought in testing whether reek is fully brainwashed i was hoping theon might regroup his wits and i said out loud to the screen slice his throat man i think that scene truly showed that theonreek wasis a person with a very very small sense of self "
"747" "guardiansek" 2014-04-14 " whatever happens after that dont be surprised if there are lots of leftovers afterward "
"748" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-14 " theon greyjoy may have known him but surely reek never did and one wouldnt want him to think that he used to have another name reek reek it rhymes with meek "
"749" "Kevin McShey" 2014-04-14 " maergery tyrol also handled the goblet "
"750" "jimmy_mac" 2014-04-14 " yes i thought it might be poisoned pie as well there were dead bloody doves in the pie were they dead from joffreys slicing or had they nibbled a bit margeary presented the pie but only it seemed because she wanted to take the focus off of joffreys horrible behavior so her announcement of the pie seemed innocent enough and she has absolutely no motive to murder her new husbandking so who then so many hated the the psychopath boy king there are plenty of suspects but it would have to be someone with power and influence does that elimiate sansa as a suspect varys has the power and influence and he keeps his mutilator in a wooden box but otherwise seems less than murderous but poisoning is a sneaky way to kill someone and varys is definitely sneaky i enjoy speculating but i hope that we will soon learn who liberated westeros from the rule of joffrey "
"751" "MooseandSquirrel" 2014-04-14 " excellent review for an excellent episode random bits i think they really nailed the pacing so far this season and the lack of nuditydidnt even detract from the episode imagine thatthis episode really made me realize how much i truly hate ramsay snoweven more so than i ever did joffery kudos to jack gleeson for portraying joffery its definately a shame hes ending his career i also liked the fact that bronn is going to be sparring with jamie "
"752" "Bluegoat" 2014-04-14 " i thought tywins expression when he realized what was happening to jofferey was interesting i couldnt tell if it was upset or angry or maybe even afraid in a way from his perspective this was not a bad thing  joffery was going to be a problem and if it wasnt clear before his actions at the wedding made it pretty obvious is he afraid because he doesnt know who did it or because his position isnt as secure as he had thought or because he does know who did it "

"805" "richholt" 2014-04-14 " i fully intend to throw a dinner party at some point then quietly close all of the doors and put rains of castamere on the sound system then sit there with my fingers steepled at the head of the table and wait to see what happens "
"806" "Moreisless" 2014-04-14 " simulcasting is a brilliant idea whoever decided it was only necessary for e1 and not for the rest of the season is not very smart "
"807" "NZerDan" 2014-04-14 " no hound around and the king got proper fcked "
"808" "NZerDan" 2014-04-14 " brienne could be jaimes right hand "
"809" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-14 " oh yes so they did  you know im beginning to think i might have become a little bit blasé where nudity is concerned on this show because my brain essentially went oh completely naked woman and then promptly forgot it "
"810" "SarahHughes" 2014-04-14 " it is always possible theyve changed storyline massively but more importantly can i direct you both to bit at top of blog  i know its hard but can we try and avoid hinting as to whats to come there are people whod like to experience the twists and turns as they come  even saying so and so should be back with a vengeance can annoy people thanks "
"811" "ffuzzy" 2014-04-14 " as far as i recall her plot line has been quiet during either ep 1 or 2 of the last couple of series but then i didnt expect them to kill off the king in ep 2 so what do i know "
"812" "ffuzzy" 2014-04-14 " indeed great performance i think i read somewhere he was off to university "
"813" "weatherwatch" 2014-04-14 "  and mates wearing chainmail under their morning suits "
"814" "jennifera30" 2014-04-14 " oh i totally disagree jaime and brienne is a love that can reach beyond the ages yes he is in love with his sister and she is in love with a gay dead man but they belong together does a fanfic "

"816" "guardiansek" 2014-04-14 " i already commented a couple times on joffrey earlier in the thread weddings are to game of thrones what a fire ant mound is to a backyard barbecue but on the hopeful romantic side ramsay snow and his significant other does prove that there is someone for everyone and they also demonstrate the importance of shared interests in a relationshiplove of the outdoors hunting dogs tormenting other human beings in case anyone missed it ramsays squeeze was one of the two women who aroused theon before ramsay castrated him last season i was thinking that with joffrey gone cersei is now the closest thing to an irredeemable character on got but its definitely ramsay i actually didnt like jaime and loras little standoff i thought jaime came across as petulant i also thought brienne halfadmitting her love for jaime was a plot development i could have done without "
"817" "SiccarPoint" 2014-04-14 " plus theyve been giving us the setup ever since midway through s3 id argue the first time tv viewer should have a better chance of figuring it out than the first time book reader "
"818" "jennifera30" 2014-04-14 " i think this was the best hour of tv i have seen  knew joffrey had to go ramsey will take over the most hated character mantle loved how roose slapped him down without even trying he is one to watch the wedding itself was perfect from start to finish rip joffery i will miss you "
"819" "guardiansek" 2014-04-14 " and check your guests for crossbows "
"820" "Kullus De Quertyman" 2014-04-14 " the king is dead long live the king a legendary episode actually good riddance to the little shite but not because he was a great character the little weasel when he cracked the cake open and was surprised by the doves also i cant wait to see the comeuppance of that evil bastard who castrated theon greyjoy who himself looks to have come down a few pegs "
"821" "Silgen" 2014-04-14 " dont invite any lannisters or boltons and definitely no freys "
"822" "guardiansek" 2014-04-14 " my money is on cersei being behind it she gets to keep power keep the hated margaery out of power and the family and frame her despised little brother for the crime i didnt buy it when last season cersei tried to pin the assassination attempt on tyrion onto joffrey i think shed be happy to push tyrion out a window if it couldnt be traced back to her "
"823" "guardiansek" 2014-04-14 " yes it would have been totally out of place but having joffrey stumble around choking and falling into the buffet table and then a couple trays of broken glassware has a certain appeal "
"824" "rickyredmanc" 2014-04-14 " i love the freeze frame button on my remote "
"825" "rickyredmanc" 2014-04-14 " definitely it was margaery or olenna  although i think they had help my money is on varys "
"826" "rickyredmanc" 2014-04-14 " don t touch the wine  "
"827" "rickyredmanc" 2014-04-14 " weird innit  were all going to miss joffers "
"828" "EdPrior" 2014-04-14 " what i want to know is what the hell are they going to do with bran after this season unless they find something different to do with him thats not in the books hes looking like he could well end up where hes supposed to be at the end of adwd by the end of this season especially given that the season finale is apparently titled the children on the other hand most of the other surviving main characters should have at least another season of story to get through after this before catching up to the books honestly i think if grrm doesnt get the next book out early next year he has literally no chance of staying ahead "
"829" "EdPrior" 2014-04-14 " its almost like they want you to pirate it isnt it "
"830" "gooddogs" 2014-04-14 " you need a sharp eye to catch who poisoned the brat king but its right there on screen bravo jack gleeson you made a marvelous villain of joffrey good luck in your future endeavours "
"831" "Kristie Robillard" 2014-04-14 " unless theyve changed the storyline massively  littlefinger will be back with a vengeance very soon i predict next episode his has a huge role to play this season and we find out the ending to some unfinished plots from bookseason 1 he will be huge "
"832" "Kristie Robillard" 2014-04-14 " they arent speeding anything up this really almost should have been the finale for last season if they waited longer theyd fuck up the rest of this season there is still a tonne of book 3 to get through and im not sure theyll get it all this season thank goodness they arent doing a book a season anymore  maybe martin will be able to finish before they do "
"833" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-14 " congradulations "
"834" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-14 " and what of sansa – is a drunken knight turned fool really the best companion for an escape attempt who cares enough for sansa at kings landing to plan her a risky escape brienne maybe the tyrell women tyrion but he wouldnt let her go away i think and littlefingers who tried to give her an escape before i miss aidan gillen time for him to come back maybe and at the wedding reception sansa was wearing the necklace the fools gave her last episode "
"835" "dsk84" 2014-04-14 " on a side note as someone whos getting married soon game of thrones is making me a bit nervous "
"836" "rockstar7" 2014-04-14 " has anyone else notice that the first 4 names at the beginning of the credits are all lannisters im a bit bumped to see joffrey dead hes one of the reasons to watch the show to see when will he suffer and die but his death was too easy it should be painful and filled with suffering "
"837" "98smithg" 2014-04-14 " what would their motivation be killing joffrey reduces their claim to the throne as it goes to the next in line they would wait until margery was with child realistically tyrion should be safe he did not exactly volunteer to be wine holder so its not like he could have planned anything "
"838" "candylilacs" 2014-04-14 " it doesnt matter who the queen is exactly because even with tommen as king and cersei and queen regent she will hold no real power tywin wont allow that and i wouldnt count the tyrells out yet  theyre playing the long game "
"839" "candylilacs" 2014-04-14 " now we will see a great deal more of tommen who is a lot sweeter than joffrey and we will prepare for an interesting time at court so far it looks like tywin is doing little to change cerseis wishes shae  who is far different in the books where shes drawn as a 16yearold faithless flibbertygibbet  is a worldlywise 20something woman in the series so im not surprised her story line has changed as for a boat moored and ready to head to pentos that seems to be the thing for most of the royal court doesnt it littlefinger had that for sansa shae had it for her and tyrion so it seems to be the goto for the wealthy emigrees as for the poisoning my moneys on the tyrells  with perhaps a little help "
"840" "SlightTrout" 2014-04-14 " no nudity it had the most breathtaking nudity ive ever seen on a tv show  a lady with her legs completely spread to camera i had to rewind to double check several times yup they did that "
"841" "candylilacs" 2014-04-14 " definitely it was margaery or olenna  although i think they had help from tywin or elsewhere who knows i was trying to figure out why the closeup of the pie thoughwas it dead doves or something else i was supposed to see and yes tyrion  why look at the cup you would have thought he had the smarts to get the heck out of dodge like sansa "
"842" "Moreisless" 2014-04-14 " not a happy bunny up at 4am turn on my sky box then it slow dawns on me it was only episode 1 that was simulcast in the states and here bugger "
"843" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-14 " and totally boss to create one of the most evil and memorable characters in tv history with his first gig then just retire right on it really is something that this kid came out of nowhere and simply nailed that part and now is going to duck back down into relative obscurity joffrey really wasnt an easy part he had to be vile and rightfully hated but at the same time he had to been seen as spoiled child who was the product of his upbringing in short we had to hate him and understand him allinall it was a pretty great turn for such a novice actor but if gleeson sees something other than acting in his future then more power to him "

"847" "JonnnyA" 2014-04-14 " kudos to jack gleeson  he nailed every single inch of that character and totally boss to create one of the most evil and memorable characters in tv history with his first gig then just retire eat your heart out msp its been a while since i read the books is it just my horrible memory or are they accelerating the events in relation to the books i didnt expect the purple wedding for a few weeks "
"848" "MrMsyvc" 2014-04-14 " insightful recap as always never a shortage of surprises in got joff gone already i wont miss him but id rather hed been deservingly skewered perhaps by tyrion the previews of ep 3 leave me wondering who is the queen presently does it matter that the marriage wasnt consummated "
"849" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-14 " everybody wanted to kill him but my guess is the one that did it or ordered it was sitting on the same same of the wedding table as him the lannisters what a family "
"850" "Zoggers" 2014-04-14 " absolutely nailed it gruesome in all the right ways credit to the showrunners and jack gleeson "
"851" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-14 " and no arya this week "
"852" "dsk84" 2014-04-14 " the episode seems to be getting a lot of discussion on facebook so ive told non book readers to avoid fb in general until they watch the episode just waiting to get home game of thrones and mad men on tonight i was under the impression that the big event would happen later in the season but when i saw the preview of this and the next episode it bumped upped the anticipation even more only problem is there are very few characters in the series that are so clear and cut in their morality that i feel ill miss him going forward "
"853" "DeleteThisPost" 2014-04-14 " the king is dead long live the king but we didnt really see much of the new king tommen was in a shot but as usual he wasnt there to actually do or say anything in many ways it seems as though joffreys death could work out for tywin he obviously didnt like his older grandson and by all accounts tommen is more tractable than joffrey so who actually killed joff well tywin may have wanted a king whos easier to control but oberyn may have wanted to punish the lannisters olenna may have wanted to save her granddaughter from a madman and tyrion may have simply lost his patience "
"854" "PlumRadio" 2014-04-14 " he didnt suffer enough dammit "
