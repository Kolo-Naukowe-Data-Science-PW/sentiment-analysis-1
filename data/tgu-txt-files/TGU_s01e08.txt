"1" "hamblemary" 2011-06-11 " hummdrumm i was glad to see you mention jack vance because so far the epic nature of this saga with its rival fiefdoms and competing interests very much reminds me of his lyonesse trilogy i loved lyonesse for the sheer vastness of its scope and story arc im pleased to discover that westeros certainly rivals the elder isles for intrigue and intricacy of interwoven plots ive not read got and ive been avoiding this blog like the plague for weeks for fear of accidental spoilers there is always someone who get sover excited or some berk desperate to show off i let all the episodes so far pile up on the pvr and then watched them all this weekend loving it cant wait for the next two rewatching stuff is great because you pick up on some much nuance and detail but nothing beats the suspense of first time watching "
"2" "Sunburst" 2011-06-11 " purpleheart cant we leave this blog spoiler free this blog is spoiler free not a single thing has been spoiled on this blog in all eight weeks of its existence not a single thing seriously people there are two choices here  either stop seeing imaginary spoilers in every harmless little bit of information or  if you truly have a hysterical phobia of even the tiniest possibility of a spoiler dont read comment threads where you think you might see them those are the two most reasonable choices the other option  having a panic attack every time someone writes the word book is really annoying stupid and damaging to any form of interesting discussion "
"3" "KarolusAfricanus" 2011-06-10 " vestrit7 yes lotr was a bit of a disappointment because of what you state earnestness no humour trying too hard and possibly also because of too much cgi for my taste im seeing all three lotr movies directors cut extended version  directors intro in oneaweek shows starting next tuesday at my local cinema i am not sure it wasnt a mistake and that ill be able to endure it as much i did when i first saw them  i so wanted to see lotr on film that i was ready to go over my misgivings i hope hbogot wont overdo cgi i already feel winterfell and the eyrie are overdone in terms of cgi i really do hope they dont screw up the battles with zillions of troops on the horizon in a any case a fine episode would agree with most that the aryastable boy kill and the wight attack scenes could have been better especially the latter werent there 2 ranger corpses in that wagon what happened to the other one why was he not attacking lord commander mormont but overall good "
"4" "bananaballs" 2011-06-10 " i am loving this series so far i have read  and love  the books and fearful of what the adaptation would do to them could they screw up a badly as sword of truth  legend of the seeker another cycle of books i enjoyed well no they havent i have refrained from commenting as watching the debate and conjecture around subjects that i already know the answer to is almost as much fun as watching the programme itself i end up having to watch each episode twice at least once with the my wife and son as i have to spend time explaining connections and answering questions and then a second time uninterrupted to enjoy seeing characters that i have invested time in reading about come to life i am glad it has succeeded and we will get a 2nd series presumably following the story of a clash of kings cant wait to see who is cast as some of the new characters that join the merry band in bookseries 2 "
"5" "Silgen" 2011-06-10 " was mr martin aware of this unfortunate choice of name as people say he populates his books with references to other things no he wasnt nor had he heard of the band when he called his bard marillion lets hope he doesnt suffer for it like poor jack vance every con he attended he ran into a sniggering british adolecent telling him what wanhk meant nudge nudge wink wink etc "
"6" "Vestrit7" 2011-06-10 " i mean the same for television and films seriously when every other message board on the internet has an edit function why cant this one "
"7" "Vestrit7" 2011-06-10 " im partly plagiarising a discussion elsewhere on the internet here about some of the little things in this episode  did anybody else love the brilliant acting by the kid playing bran i absolutely loved the scene with the greatjon and his fingers brans in the middle looking back and forth trying really hard to keep up with things and trying really hard to show that hes not terrified and then when everybodys laughing you can see that he knows he should laugh as well but has absolutely no idea what just happened and his delivery of well your friend did put a knife to my throat made me laugh out loud with the sole exception of the stableboy the child actors in this series have been amazing slightly more negative comment lord of the rings the return of the king was on telly on saturday night and i had nothing better to do so i watched it now i wasnt much of a fan of the lotr films at the time they came out i found them overly earnest humourless and just trying far too hard watching the return of the king again having read asoiaf and been watching this series since i last saw it i veered between serious cringing and laughing out loud at it after i read asoiaf i feared it would ruin me for other fantasy books and i wonder if this series will do the same or more positively i wonder if it will force everybody who follows to significantly raise their game the advent of joe abercrombie and scott lynch would suggest this is already happening on the book front "
"8" "HummDrumm" 2011-06-10 " i think youll find that its shagga still not as amusing as jack vance with servants of the wankh was mr martin aware of this unfortunate choice of name as people say he populates his books with references to other things "
"9" "bobbleoff" 2011-06-09 " i laughed out loud when we were introduced to shagger son of dolph "
"10" "glitterfairy11" 2011-06-09 " i cant help wondering how significant the loss of lady will be for sansa the boys still have their dire wolves and are doing relatively well arya is without hers and is currently in peril but has the potential for escape and perhaps i hope being reunited with her wolf sansa on the other hand seems to trapped in the vipers nest with no chance of escape and no wolf to look out for her "
"11" "pintooo" 2011-06-09 " drstaunch  fully agree with all you say walkerboyuk  you seem to lay blame at the innocents feet bran was doing what he always does as established in the first show he climbs he happened upon cersei and jaime they were in the wrong  he was the victim joffrey was repellent before he was embarrassed by arya and her direwolf as seen by the smacking he got from tyrion when he refused to offer sympathy to the starks for brans accident and when he chose to use a real sword on the butchers boy who only had a stick and wouldnt attack a royal anyway cowardly little brat drunk on power and wine sansa is a wet blanket but she has been tutored to act the right way it is her strength and her weakness she is so headoverheels with joffrey and so keen not to embarrass him she lies for him and even when her direwolf is killed for that mistake she doesnt know what the right course of action would have been the closing scene of this episode showed sansa facing a huge job  to get ned to swear fealty to joffrey she doesnt have all the facts but she is desperately trying to save her fathers life i really hope this is a turning point for her because while all the other stark and bastard stark children have grown with the burden of responsibility sansa so far has crumbled under it and she is the only one left unprotected by her direwolf "
"12" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-09 " walkerboyuk ive often wondered the same thing about the kids but upon reflection i think the major events were developing regardless of their involvement jon arryns death had already occured ned had been aasked to become the hand of the king both those events really triggered his investigation fed by clues given my littlefinger brans fall didnt really change anything other than to ultimately spur catelyn into visiting kings landing to warn ned joffrey i think is an infuriating prk full stop  i dont think sansas response to mycha the butchers son changed much she was left having to pick sides really between arya  joffrey  and went with duty over family i think the event itself did however bring events into focus and brought a stark vs lannister confrontation closer in the last episode sansa has been left in a postion where it looks as though her reaction to the situation her father is in and the accusation of treachery is likely to be critical will she try and get a confession from her father or not  and what effect will her actions have  "
"13" "WalkerboyUK" 2011-06-09 " formicaatomica  the whole situation can be entirely blamed on children if bran hadnt gone climbing up the tower walls he wouldnt have witnessed anything and then there wouldnt have been 2 counts of attempted murder on him if sansa hadnt got involved and blamed the butchers boy for attacking arya then joffrey wouldnt have also got involved been attacked by the diowolf and subsequently been the infuriating little prk that he is those two situations have pretty much brought around the situation that everyone is now caught up in with the exception of dany and the dothraki thoroughly enjoying the series it doesnt strike me as really being a fantasy show in the same way that a lot of film are eg lotr its almost got a historic reality feel to it because everyones playing it nice and straight rather than camp have been very tempted to buy the books but am going to wait until the series has finished maybe ill hint to the mrs that theyll be a suitable birthday present especially as theyre 5 each at play or 3 for 2 in most bookshops theres only one thing im waiting for seeing as jerome flynn is present at any moment i anticipate robson green taking a break from extreme fishing and turning up and breaking into some cheesy cover "
"14" "macster" 2011-06-09 " candylilacs several servants  also theyre in a massive castle hundreds of miles from any threat with thousands of loyal men as well as teachers nursemaids and everything they could need in the meantime her husband and daughters are in huge danger in kl  she didnt leave winterfell on a quest for vengeance she went to warn ned "
"15" "candylilacs" 2011-06-09 " melissa2807 thanks i thought it was a little heavyhanded foreshadowing as i said earlier though cant stand catelyn yeah she has several servants at home but a child recently crippled and another about five years old she just seems like she completely lost perspective while seeking vengeance as for tywin  the perfect distant hypercritical and cold father figure "
"16" "DrStaunch" 2011-06-09 " pintoooi agree re littlefingeri think the series has been more enjoyable than the book my one gripe is how they handled that character they made it clear in the series early on that littlefinger would betray ned when they had him reveal the dogs story to sansa as well as the threat if she said anything also in the book it was important that the dog did reveal that himself also the scene last week preempted the major twist with nedalso rethat scene i think it was needless tasteless and immature it was like some schoolboys were allowed to write a scene and went for that lesbian porn it undermines everything "
"17" "pintooo" 2011-06-08 " boring bookreference coming up last week littlefinger was involved in the controversial lesbianexposition scene for me this added nothing to the show this week the show shied away from the raping of the sheep people even though that has some significance strange choice but the difference is not a storydriver as much as a decency one "
"18" "anderton76" 2011-06-08 " i wanted ser barristan selmy to appear and fight side by the side with the dancing master in defence of neds daughter romantic and sentimental i know but there is truly noble glorious even about making a stand against overwelming odds to protect a childthe old maid was irritating throughout the series but again she knew she was going to die yet she did not falter there are some fine character actors in this series the great james cosmo for oneanyone worried about the battle scenes dont worry hbo staged a great recreation of the battle of philipi in rome "
"19" "purpleheart" 2011-06-08 " this is gripping stuffim enjoying seeing the stark children take up their differing positions  bran at winterfell robb leading an army of disparate houses sansa asking for mercy for her father and arya escaping to fight another dayooh and jon snow at the wall fighting zombies thats a lot of plates to keep in the air and its impressive plotting indeed can i add my heartfelt request against spoilers from book readers ive purposely not read the books as i was tempted to when i started watching as i want to enjoy the story as it unfolds on the screen this blog has been safe but now i know far too much that book readers can speculate on elsewherecant we leave this blog spoiler free "
"20" "lifetemp" 2011-06-08 " just a note of warning about the links on this page i am currently reading the second book wondering what will happen to various characters well i was just enjoying the interview with grrm when the length of the next book was being discussed suddenly it mentioned the displacement of the viewpoints of various characters so now i know the character i was thinking was in danger is definitely in book 5 great "
"21" "ALY81" 2011-06-08 " i read the first book just before watching the show as i always like to have my own vision first and i must say that for me the series has proved just as thrilling and intriguing as the novel you can tell the grrm has been closely consulted but is also clearly man enough to let the series take its own path and some of the additional scenes have added depth to characters ie cersei  jaime that was difficult to get in the books where their perspective and motivations are only subjectively given by the chapter narrators im also watching it with two nonreaders and i love watching their looks of surprise  and they like having me to elaborate on the clans and locations of certain things as without constant references to the map it gets confusing so sometimes a little knowledge of the book is a good thing basically i love love love this series and will be counting the days until the next one "
"22" "JamesWMoar" 2011-06-08 " well at least noone has give away the bit where  exit pursued by a direwolf "
"23" "Rosimir" 2011-06-08 " ive just caught up with episode 8 the many short scenes telescoping the action did seem to serve as a prelude to the no doubt great cliffhanger climax tyrion and bronn are indeed developing into a wonderful doubleact and i loved the look on samwell tarlys face on being told that he wasnt stupid got is so gripping those in the know must be constantly bursting to blurt out what will happen only two episodes to go in this season but hey as a nonreader ill have the book to relive it all again "
"24" "kurekamo" 2011-06-08 " more on drogos fight im not going to give away anything which hasnt been said already hopefully but you may want to skip if youre fervently avoiding all spoilers bearing in mind sarahs for want of a nail chain of events its noticeable that drogo gets into the fight and gets injured as an immediately direct result of danys actions interesting to see how that plays out i started reading the books at the same time as the series started i managed to just about pace them against each other until the last couple off weeks but gave up and ploughed on with the books theyre both pretty good arent they "
"25" "DrStaunch" 2011-06-08 " i am reading the books and i am disappointed that people have given things away particularly re syrio reading a book is no real achievement you dont need to make comments about it please on the basis of the first series i think it has been better than the book i would advise anyone thinking of reading it to hold off until the final episode airs "
"26" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-08 " ok everyone this is partially my fault as i let my frustration with one particular ommission spill over but lets try and lay off the spoilers inadvertant or otherwise i know its really hard but the last few weeks the discussion has been pretty good here without tipping into spoilers and id like to try and keep it that way and yes i have slapped my own wrist for triggering some of this "
"27" "vk1980" 2011-06-07 " ephiny0 what are we to make of varys replying not today to neds saying he might as well just kill him now thats not a connection thats hinted at in the books as far as i can remember but surely must be more than a coincidence especially as this episode was written by grrm himself it is known  maybe its just a bit of fun like the above catchphrase i bet others will come out with the line at some point winter is coming  not today "
"28" "vk1980" 2011-06-07 " eg she couldnt believe ned was trusting or at least hoping for help from littlefinger and i said i can remember being surprised by this in the book i was called stupid i mean i was surprised by littlefingers betrayal "
"29" "vk1980" 2011-06-07 " its been difficult for me as a reader discussing with my wife non readereg she couldnt believe ned was trusting or at least hoping for help from littlefinger and i said i can remember being surprised by this in the book i was called stupid maybe i was a bit naive or maybe its just the nature of the different mediums  in an 800 page book you have 400000ish words whereas the tv show is 10 hoursish  in one you get nuance and detail and in the other you get the essence in bullet points still at least as a reader i can tell you all that the the dream referred to is the entire story its all in brans head you see he comes round as old nan is finishing reading him his bedtime tale and the series ends with her words and they all lived happily ever after the end "

"32" "SoCalifornication" 2011-06-07 " sensational episode i really wanted to syrio to live and in my frantic search for spoilers on the net glimpsed spoilers for the next episode made the same mistake earlier in the season i really hope the one liner i read concerning a certain characters fate is not true but the response to that person seems to indicate that i unfortunately know a key event in advance there is no safe place to go on the internet concerning game of thrones without someone feeling the need to throw out a couple spoilers even mundane ones to demonstrate to everyone that they read the books this blog was a safe place the past weeks but even here it is hard to read all the comments and not pick up on the book readers foreknowledge of the plot i would rather have not known that syrios fate is left open to interpretation by the author or that the injury definitely plays a big part in the future i did expect the injury to play a big part but was not certain it is a challenge for nonbook readers to find a place to discuss the hbo series without having book readers intentionally or inadvertently tip off future plot points "

"36" "Melissa2807" 2011-06-07 " i havent read the books and i thought it was pretty obvious that drogos injury was significant they were going on about it for ages i think he will end up dying of some kind of infection definitely agree with whoever said that dany will end up the stronger of the two maybe she will lead the dothraki if drogo ends up dying of his injury dunno how that will work though as they dont seem to like her much at the mo  maybe they will be drawn to her strength i dont see how a baby will fit into the whole situation though i cant imagine it fitting with the story  maybe she has it adopted to keep it safe or something im still finding catlyn the most irritating character  someone said last time that her motto was family duty or something and it was important that family came first  well she is the one who got her family into the mess its in and now shes gone and left her youngest kids home alone selfish selfish selfish i wish people could post spoilers on here lol i wanna know if my theories are correct im a click away from kindling the book  how many episodes are left "

"40" "lifetemp" 2011-06-07 " i started reading the books just after watching episode one and i just cant believe all of this passed me by i read sci fi and occasional fantasy books and these are what ive been looking for without even knowing it the main thing i want to praise is the casting of the show  every single character is cast to perfection i too cheered when i saw little john playing the greatjon the subjective nature of the narration of the books has been beautifully conveyed in subtle moments  catelyns seeing her son her boy dressed for war was wonderful so too cerseis calculated invitation for sansa to speak to joffrey and sansas selection of every word like stepping through a minefield watching and reading the books its been so long since ive genuinely worried about the well being of the heroes and detested the villains  the lannisters make my blood boil it is going to be hard waiting so long for the next series "
"41" "UnclePhaester" 2011-06-07 " can those of you whove read the books be a bit more considerate please ignatieff88 has already effectively told us what we will or wont be seeing from one character for the rest of this series and this dream flashback thing you keep discussing is going to be just as spoily if you dont keep it down "
"42" "DiamondDag" 2011-06-07 " another great episode these last few have been exhilarating even for someone who knows what happens i think syrio is the perfect example of what a great adaptation this is the fact that in his few scenes he has tv viewers invested in his fate in the exact same way you do when you read the scenes in the book its fantastic probably my favourite thing was robb taking centre stage at last very well played by richard madden especially when his fussing mother turns up and instantly makes him feel like a lost little boy when he needs to act a lord in front of his bannermen one of those silly what if moments i have is imagining jon not taking the black and being at robbs side when he goes after the lannisters those two together would be formidable id imagine as it is jon has enough trouble at the wall the scene with the wight attacking the lord commander lacked a bit of weight but thats being very nitpicky out of all the great performances john bradley is quietly getting on with playing samwell tarly perfectly someone else rightly pointed out he is challenging tyrion for the best lines in the show at this point i have to say whatever little worries i have as a fan are constantly getting blown away by the performances the quality of the actors is making this show what it is barristan selmy has that one scene in the throne room and its as powerful as anything else in the episode "
"43" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-07 " macster i dont want to discuss too much here  obviously for reasons of possible spoilers  and im not sure how far you have read in the series one thing though  grrm is fully aware of the theories and possibilities around syrio and he is evasive about them as you would if you were the author i tried to push him on it when i was lucky enough to meet him here in belfast as i suspect have many others  but to no avail he wrote this episode and he had the opportunity to make syrios fate clear at least clearer than the books  he didnt thereby leaving a door ajar two reasons for that  he is either leaving his and syrios options open  or hes messing with our minds i havent made my mind up which it is "
"44" "Adrian23" 2011-06-07 " so as a book reader i wont spoil anything but there have been numerous comments on here and other sites  mostly in usa  complaining and asking about the point of last nights giant penis of hordor  the writers of the show are being very true to the books and in the book that scene is described so does that mean there is any point to it probably not but hey i prefer it when showsmovies remain faithful to source material "
"45" "judierudie" 2011-06-07 " someone commented earlier on cersei looking constipated i just think its a lena headey look  anyone who saw her in the sarah connor chronicles will be familiar with it having not the read books ive no idea whats coming next which makes for great viewing i wouldnt even like to hazard a guess the way the plot twists and turns loving every single minute though "
"46" "macster" 2011-06-07 " smartymcfly  no we dont know but we can take a fair guess a swordsman with no sword against a pissedoff kingsguard and half a dozen lannister men also pissedoff your sound argument sounds like clutching at straws the syrios alive theory just doesnt fit with whats been seen or is in the book to me anyway  one of those fan flightsoffancy that doesnt work the rest of it  just great great tv rollicking along at breakneck speed from the start only slowing slightly for some brilliant scenes with tywintyrion drogo finding yet more interesting ways to kill people and the throne room scene with barristan more wolves still not enough hound though im guessing some material is being held back for the next season "
"47" "pintooo" 2011-06-07 " hugely enjoyable episode i cant help it i 3 cersei "
"48" "mygrimmbrother" 2011-06-07 " best thing about got the pacing especially this episode in the space of approximately 50 minutes you have robb receive the news of neds imprisonment his rallying of the northen houses and then the armies on the verge of clashing already this blstering pace has kept me constantly surprised and on the edge of my seat i know some may find it rushed obviously weeks must have passed between these events but its more than simply expedient  it barrels along and just keeps giving solid gold "
"49" "TAFKAJamie" 2011-06-07 " charliebronze how rubbish were the stark retinue easily ambushed by jaime ambushed when ned was doublecrossed and picked off without much fuss again here well ambush crops up a lot there also bear in mind that before things went nuts ned had already portioned off some of his household guard to the city watch so they were already understrength when ambushed and doublecrossed robb otoh has an army who one imagines are rather better prepared for a fight "
"50" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-07 " charlie bronze  well we dont really know and that was my point the use of sound has appeared to be considered direwolf barking aside so there may well be a specific significance there or there may not suffice to say there is an out there for grrm to bring syrio back beyond book 1 if he so chooses  chose "
"51" "ignatieff88" 2011-06-07 " as regards the dream scene i just cannot see how they can leave it out  but i guess its the kind of scene that can be put in anywhere when needed as regards to ser meryn in the throne room in the book grrm states that he look annoyed and frustrated implying that syrio got away or something like that  which is what most syrio lovers cling on to "
"52" "Bjerkley" 2011-06-07 " really enjoyed it again and lena headeys constant smirk is a joy to behold "
"53" "CharlieBronze" 2011-06-07 " the off camera sounds were coming from elsewhere in the castle as arya fled how rubbish were the stark retinue easily ambushed by jaime ambushed when ned was doublecrossed and picked off without much fuss again here i hope robbs army is made up of better men otherwise its gonna be another arsekicking "
"54" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-07 " syrio is the subject of many fan theories out there  whcih i wont go into for fear of spoilers just a few things i noticed though sound appears very important in this show  it always seems very considered as in syrios first scene with arya  they are fighting with wooden swords with an onlooking ned the sound is of wooden swords that gradually blends to the sound of steel on steel as we watch neds expression become more concerned with last nights syrio scene  we hear off camera  the sound of steel on steel and a scream we left him armed only with a broken wooden sword and ser meryn in full armour and steel the steel on steel soudns as though it is an important detail also  syrio does not seem to be the type to scream having said that  we see ser meryn later on in the throne room  so draw your own conclusions "
"55" "alaska" 2011-06-07 " i recommend to read the books there is much more in the books than in the tv series what is the difference it is like making love compared to watching people have sex "

"60" "MockingbirdGirl" 2011-06-07 " as several people have commented on drogos badass fight scene  which isnt in the original novel  it might be of interest to some that the scene was actually added at jason momoas request httpinsidetvewcom20110605gameofthronesepisode8 "
"61" "EddieLarkin" 2011-06-07 " a certain location on the edge of dorne perchance he has the dream while in the cells  where he is right now  so dont lose heart im afraid he has the dream after he is attacked by jaime during a fever rather than in the cells not to say they cant move it to that point but there was never any casting announcements for lyanna so i doubt well see it both the mad king and brandon stark neds brother were cast though so perhaps well see a flashback involving them "
"62" "sfffff" 2011-06-07 " for me what was an even more iconic or at least important scene in the book was the title scene where arya kills the boy in the stable in the tv adaptation this scene seemed to be skimped on despite title recognition its possible that my expectations led me to believe that it would be the artistic conclusion to the episode and rather they used it as a low key intro hopefully ill enjoy it more in the future without these expectations "
"63" "dotmegsam" 2011-06-07 " i am increasingly impressed with the quality of the acting  in fantasy it is so easy to trip into heroic and declamatory acting but watch charles dance underplay tywin and show the character weighing political consequences of every action by himself and others or lena headley show cersei doing what she has to but still relating to sansa and ned also the writing  sam is challenging tyrion for the best lines crown i wanted to be a wizard theres honour in being a stewardand food as well as his satisfaction in being told that he may a coward but he isnt stupid and syrios refrain of what do we say to death gains pathos and reverence with each repetition glad i havent succumbed to reading the books as it keeps me guessing but the series has pulled fantasy out of the dungeons and dragons ghetto and is the most engrossing television around right now "
"64" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-07 " kingslayer i would argue why i think we need it sooner rather than later but it would get off topic and really i just love the scene and want to see it good point regarding the plotting its very clever and all the more so for the fact that the descent into war is both inevitable and almost accidental "
"65" "EACLucifer" 2011-06-07 "  sarahhughes the other concerns an iconic flashback scene which im increasingly concerned we wont see a certain location on the edge of dorne perchance he has the dream while in the cells  where he is right now  so dont lose heart "
"66" "Kingslayer" 2011-06-07 "  sarah yeah we need more hound also the flashback you refer to is it the tower of thingy from the time of roberts rebellion if so then i dont think its needed just yet its implied imporatnce in the books has yet to be paid off 4 books later was just thinking that when i first read the books it was around this point that i realised just how brilliant martins writing especially his plotting is so what you have is some squabbling and politicking between the noble houses with a murder mystery plot device which gradually descends into a full blown war and you barely notice its happening theres no pompous council of elrond type scene to hammer the point home gregor clegane and his band of scumbags raid some peasant village ned sends out a group of knights to bring him down and the next thing you know there armies smashing the crap out of each other "
"67" "TinyFemaleWriter" 2011-06-07 " eacluciferit is always delightful to see normal naked human bodies rather than eh so im told cough the perfect bodies of porn stars which are just about the only naked humans we get to see on the screen nowadays gives you a sort of one of us feeling as in thank god there are more humans like me out there warms my heart every time this was a really good episode supported by the sad fact that it only felt like five minutes long i want more robb had until now come across as weak and indecisive but he is clearly rising to the challenge of leading the stark armyhouse tyrion good arya and her dancing master brilliant i must agree with those that have mentioned that some scenes are not properly fleshed out as in aryas scene with the boy she killed they are trying to squeeze an awful lot of material into each one hour episode "
"68" "SarahHughes" 2011-06-07 " werthead  when i was first writing this i had a par about the difference between martins writing style and that of benioff and weiss the key difference i think is that grrm having written the books doesnt feel the need to treat the subject matter with reverence and thus the episode moved quicker than some of the others on one hand i really appreciate how faithful the other writers have been to the source but i do think that it has occasionally clogged up the action and this episode was notably free of that slower pace katypie no i think youre right and it was for ayra but i just really wanted him to survive objectinspace id watch either spin off i think jerome flynn is doing a really nice job here and also enjoyed the whole you wouldnt know quip redronin im on the whole she was uncomfortable side  talking of which i liked how they showed joffrey fidgeting on the throne it was a nice touch kingslayer ooh great spot about jorah ignatieff88  true there might have only been one moment of nudity but what a moment oh a couple of other points i really liked both the scene where the septa walked to her death and the moment of barristans resignation both of which gave good character insight in only a few words or in the septas case little to no words finally i do have two quibbles but theyre both book related so i wont discuss them here for the record one involves the lack of screentime given to the hound in contrast to the books the other concerns an iconic flashback scene which im increasingly concerned we wont see "
"69" "katypie" 2011-06-07 " i will be happy to be proved wrong but i really dont think syrio survived what do we say to death not today  well that was for arya wasnt it he knows that her stubborn fierce nature wouldnt allow her to flee so he presents running as a stand against death "
"70" "EACLucifer" 2011-06-06 "  trickydicky there do seem to be quite a number of people overjoyed at the sight of hodors hodor "
"71" "objectinspace" 2011-06-06 " kingslayer thanks good spot with jorahs clothing as i think other commentators have mentioned working out exactly where his loyalties lie is proving a nice challenge though as per the clothing he seems to get closer to the dothrak  dani each episode his contact with varys leaves things beautifully open to doubt the same could also be said for the latter of course "
"72" "SmallPaul" 2011-06-06 " best line of the night after ned asks varys why he didnt intervene to help the starks  do i look like a hero to you "
"73" "SmartyMcFly" 2011-06-06 " really good episode  so many iconic moments my favourite two being syrioarya and aryastable boy the first was done really well the second as has already been said felt rushed and accidental rather than deliberate and shocking im a book reader  but it is such a different and totally enjoyable experience watching things develop on tv some things are made a bit more explicit on tv talking plot points  not boobs n bums whereas the books are more subtle about various aspects "
"74" "trickydicky" 2011-06-06 " feels a bit redundant to say great episode but great episode however it did seem a tiny bit rushed at times ie from robb hearing dads in jail to mustering an army to nearly attacking the lannisters all went by in a flash however to have done it at a realistic pace would have undone the whole feeling of thoughtless headlong omigawd everyones gonna die type stuffapologies for my overexuberent inarticulteness after last weeks slightly uncomfortable lesbo scene i watch got with my wife  this week i had the er privelige of being instructed by mrs dicky to rewind and pause when naked hodor appeared on screen sighjust been on imdb and have learnt there are only two more episodes in this season the word im thinking of rhymes with rollocks its bollocks "
"75" "Werthead" 2011-06-06 " the wildling girl that was talking to bran talks about life north of the wall it seems but then how does she get to be south of the wall the wall is meant to stop armies its way too long for the nights watch to keep an eye on every single foot of it in fact theres a great line from tyrions visit cut from the show where tyrion works out that the watch only has 33 men for each mile of the wall and of course most of them are in the castles or out on patrol at any moment so theres vast stretches of it which go unmonitored how do you scale the wall with a lot of luck more prosaically the wall stops at the sea and the wildlings have a small number of fishing boats so its possible to simply sail around it "
"76" "redwinter" 2011-06-06 " this was so good i feel positively giddy i might even have clapped i didnt know this weeks episode was written by grrm until i read the blog but the writing was really tight  so much going on complex shifts of men locations and loyalties but it never felt muddled all the storylines are picking up pace and i was utterly gripped from beginning to end the slower moments bran in the woods with the kindaslavewhosenameescapesme robb leaving winterfell the inspection of the dead rangers etc all added to the tension rather than disrupting the pace as has sometimes been the case in earlier episodes robb finally stepped into the spotlight  i loved all the round table scenes with his commanders clive mantle was wonderful  just the right side of brian blessed camp with a genuine query over which way hell jump if robb keeps ignoring his advice and i loved the dothraki scenes im fascinated by the possibility that daenerys growing ambitions both for herself and her child are not just threatening the khals supremacy among his people but might just threaten the dothrakis entire future even better  she knows it and so does jorah best line of the night  varys to ned is this the face of a hero i may have misquoted  but the sentiment was perfect "
"77" "Kingslayer" 2011-06-06 " slightly worried that the lack of major battles scenes so far either jamie v riverrun or the dothrak all these battles happen offscreen in the books as well if my memory serves and the tv show follows the books chronology the first big setpiece battle should be coming up in the next episode one random detail i liked is jorah slowly going native by wearing dothraki clothes speaking of which the dothraki scenes have been bugging me just a little as its the one place where the limited budget shows drogo is supposed to have 30 or 40 thousandish riders but its always the same dozen dudes plus a few camp followers sitting around in tents one or two cgi shots to epic things up a bit would be cool like the ones they did to establish the lannister army camp "
"78" "Werthead" 2011-06-06 " as for rob releasing the scout is it done only for a sense of honor etc or is there a strategic reasoning behind didnt rob tell his mom he had 80000 troops but the scout only counted 20000 misinformation or more stark honorable sensibilities getting in the way of selfpreservation robb told his mother they had 18000 troops but the lannister scout counted a bit more than that so robb let him believe that more than 20000 puts the stark host closer in size to tywins 30000 which will no doubt make tywin more cautious in any engagement than if he knew he had over a third more men than robb the military stuff in the books is pretty interesting though the numbers are utterly enormous by medieval standards and its good that theyre getting into that a little bit "
"79" "Gimplord" 2011-06-06 " that was absolutely gripping television i just get so immersed in it that the hour just flies by was very tempted to buy the books a couple of weeks ago but am glad ive resisted until the end of the series as i really have no idea what is coming next it will be a kindle download over the closing titles in two weeks though one question  the wildling girl that was talking to bran talks about life north of the wall it seems but then how does she get to be south of the wall redronin  i agree cersei looked like at the very least a couple of windeze would help or maybe its the hard seats "
"80" "Werthead" 2011-06-06 " i had the pleasure of meeting a few of the cast in belfast when they were filming he pilot and probably spoke the longest to richard madden and sophie turner who were both overbrimming with enthusiasm for their roles robb and sansa respectively seeing them both come to the fore in this episode was excellent robb is a young man who knows what is expected of him and steps decisively up to the plate but not without a certain degree of wellhidden trepidation and richard played that brilliantly whilst sophie got across sansas realisingshesinthedeepend playing of the court very well sansa i think has not been bestserved by the tv adaptation but here came across as much more relatable book trivia fans will be pleased by the attention to detail they appear to be just glorified extras in the show but acknowledging that timmett and chella with her necklace of ears taken from slain foes are there with shagga is cool whilst some of the minor northern lords show up such as galbart glover at the winterfell feast and then a woman in armour at robbs strategy planning who must be one of the mormont warriorwomen totally overlooked by tv viewers but a nice bit of detail for the book fans i think you can also tell that martin wrote the episode the characters seem to breathe a lot more easily and there was no sexposition or clunky backstory revelations in fact its worth musing on whether the true casualty of the books taking so long to come out is that if theyd been finished faster grrm could have played a bigger role in writing for the series as it is itll be a while before he does another one episode 9 of season 2 will apparently be his as well "
"81" "MJNoble" 2011-06-06 " great look from charles dance when tyrion made some quip about not being the kind of son he would have wanted and agree that bronns you wont have heard of him was superb really liking that character "
"82" "SoCalifornication" 2011-06-06 " as a nonbook reader i admit to being hooked to the series cant wait to see what comes next theories change by the day sooooo just to be clear tywin is now the kings hand and jamie is the leader of the kings guard the lannisters control all key positions relating to the throne in kings landing i do wonder if the leader that was forced to retire will come back to haunt he was none too happy as he stormed out and he did appear to be taken aback last week at the queen ripping up roberts testamentary instrument indicating his preference for ned to rule until joffrey reaches the proper age as for rob releasing the scout is it done only for a sense of honor etc or is there a strategic reasoning behind didnt rob tell his mom he had 80000 troops but the scout only counted 20000 misinformation or more stark honorable sensibilities getting in the way of selfpreservation hope syrio is not dead "

"85" "Siriamis" 2011-06-06 " loved it  thought it was loads better than last week and things are really starting to kick off now i think my eyes actually watered at khal drogos badass execution though s the only bit i didnt really like and was surprised as this was writted by george rr martin was the way arya dispatched the stable boy i know people get fed up with book comparisons but this was a much bigger deal in the book  it didnt happen so quicklyaccidentally anyway maybe theyll address it further in the next episode i guess on a slightly less serious note i wonder how specific the casting breakdown for hodor was d "
"86" "quirkypenguin" 2011-06-06 " good episode nice amount of direwolf ie some rather than none hodors flashing and finally the appearance of rickon spent quite some time thinking the greatjon was being played by greg davies from the inbetweeners before suddenly shouting out its that bloke off casualty "
"87" "EddieLarkin" 2011-06-06 " the bald zombie was a former member of the nightwatch wasnt he was he now a white walker too or a lesser kind of collateral damage killed by them but cursed with reanimation was he specifically attacking the lord commander yes the two bodies found were members of benjen starks ranging party he was a reanimated zombie that the white walkers bring back recall the little girl in the opening of episode 1 who was impaled on a tree but was later walking around in the books i believe they theorize that he was trying to kill the lord commander yes possibly due to old memories or whatever im still getting to know this world so is house lankycasualtybastard related to house lannister in any way no he is the head of house umber one of the many northern houses robb called to war "
"88" "redronin" 2011-06-06 " decent episode though was hoping for more with grrm on writing duties compared to recent episodes most of the content was straight from the book which was slightly disappointing for me as ive really been enjoying the bonus material anyway good stuff fight scenes especially drogo interesting that grrm decided to change the original plot as to how he gets his scar in the book you dont witness him in a fight hes just got injured from a random clash with a local guess it was a good excuse for him to show off his wellardness anyway also great to see return of tyrion along with one of my favourite minor characters shagga son of dolf not so good was kind of underwhelmed by the wight attack scene at the wall just not scary or shocking enough and ended rather abruptly we never saw what happened to the second wight either also dont know if anyone else was bothered by it but cersei had a rather strange expression on her face all the way through the final scene like she had a bad case of constipation "

"91" "Lalwende" 2011-06-06 " that was bloody excellent im struggling to think who gave the best performace this week because they were all that good but i did want to cheer when i saw clive mantle as the greatjon  hes perfect for that part as anyone who saw him play little john hoh  bit of irony there too in robin of sherwood way back in the 80s would also think cant wait to see what those who havent read the books think is going to happen now "
"92" "sharpeiboy" 2011-06-06 " barrybadrinath oho the prospect of a year to wait for the next season poor readers have had for many years for the next book to appear book 6 or 5 if you class one volume as 2 books  those people who knew the series before hbo came along feel like you but far far worse from the series on tv it is every bit as good as what has appeared in print so far which is pretty amazing seeing that most former adaptations from the word to the image fail miserably or are changed immensely "

"94" "CharlieBronze" 2011-06-06 " this is just so good i liked that syrio is not explicitly shown to fall at the hands of the useful kingsguard but i fear that watching future episodes in the hope of seeing him again would be like watching the sopranos after the pine barrens episode in the hope of seeing the russian interior decorator again the princess bride comparison is impossible to avoid especially as the ease with which syrio dealt with the lannister oafs is so reminiscent of the elegant ease in which inigo montaya dispatches the guards in the corridor httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvazrdshcvx8w i loved ser barristan selmys noble indignation scene tyrion continues to delight i want more white walker actioninfo too the bald zombie was a former member of the nightwatch wasnt he was he now a white walker too or a lesser kind of collateral damage killed by them but cursed with reanimation was he specifically attacking the lord commander we get a passing mention of jaimes success in battles i want to see these battles "
"95" "cant20" 2011-06-06 " another great episode filled with iconic moments perhaps too many i felt that for all the power and justification the scene involving syrio and arya did to the source material the same was lost with regards to the white walker attack at the wall i was looking forward to this scene as it is one of the standouts in the book and i feel that it was a little rushed through understandable seeing as there was so much else to fit in but i felt that the scene lost much of its power and importance it is vital for the success of the wall scenes that they convey a real sense of fear and dread as to what is lurking beyond and why the nights watch is such a vital commodity of the realm the scenes involving the dothraki are really coming together and the pillaging of the lamb people was just as i imagined the khals throat ripping antics had to be the most bad ass execution ever witnessed on tv and there was no skimping on the direwolves take that lanky casualty bloke "
